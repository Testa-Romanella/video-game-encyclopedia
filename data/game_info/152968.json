Bring it to either dropoff zone (yellow square) to score.  Each time you score, you also earn a jump.</p><p>Beware!  Jumps are shared between players!  Use them wisely and always communicate with your partner.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>P1 - S rotates your light cycle 90 degrees counter-clockwise; F rotates it 90 degrees clockwise; E jumps a short distance.</p><p>P2 - Same as P1, except with the arrow keys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc382500253f9863eb8a1a7437c3eb26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eric Guadara"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
