The game has a single story path, clocking in at about <strong>6k words</strong>.</p>\n<p>Downloading the game gets you a Windows .exe or Linux file, all zipped up with a bow. It's also available in the browser (above - <strong>expect long load times if using in-browser - we definitely recommend downloading!</strong>), with a Mac version (hopefully!) coming soon. <strong><em>Mothdude </em></strong>was made for the 3rd annual Spooktober Visual Novel Jam, and is dearly beloved - if you like it too, please spread the word!</p>\r\nWhat else?\r\n<p>The game features <strong>SAVE</strong>, <strong>LOAD</strong>, and <strong>FAST-FORWARD</strong> options, as well as further audio and text speed configuration options, available to be changed whenever there's text on the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We'd recommend playing through the story from the beginning (sensibly enough), but do offer a <strong>CHAPTER SELECT</strong> for revisiting or showing off your favorite scenes!</p>\n<p>There's no Back option, though scrolling while in-game will bring up a <strong>BACKLOG </strong>of the most recent lines.</p>\r\nWho did this?\r\n<p><strong><em>Mothdude </em></strong>was made by Benjamin Feinstein and Eli Hersh, with script by Eli Hersh, art by Benjamin Feinstein, and additional direction by both.
