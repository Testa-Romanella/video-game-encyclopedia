Enemy foxes will come from all directions to try to attack\r\n      your flowers. Defend your flowers placing bees on or around them. If you lose 3 flowers, the game is over! Your\r\n      score is equal to how many seconds you lasted.\r\n    </p><p>\r\n      You can produce more bees at your bee hive by pollinating the flowers. A flower is considered \"pollinated\" if\r\n      there is at least bee on it. The more flowers that are pollinated, the faster you will produce bees. The number\r\n      of bees on a particular flower does not affect the pollination rate (1 is the same as 100), so try to make sure every flower has at least one bee on it.</p><p>\r\n      To aid in your map awareness, indicators of different colors will point to your flowers. The color indicates the\r\n      state of the flower.\r\n    </p><p>    Purple: The flower is fine. <br/>Orange: The bees stationed at the flower are attacking enemies. <br/>Red: The flower has no more bees defending it and is taking damage. </p><br/>Controls<p>    Arrow Keys: Move your cursor. <br/>Z (btn1): Place a bee at an anchor point. <br/>X (btn2): Pick up all the bees at an anchor point. </p><p>Check out the source on github!<br/>https://github.com/greysonp/swarm<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5d/f5de4e002ccf3dba541b67e2bf8d1789.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["greysonp"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
