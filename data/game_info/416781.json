Use super powered abilities to blast cars away or teleport right through them.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In multiplayer mode you'll be facing off against your friends in ravenous last-man-standing duels. You'll have to dodge cars but watch out, the force wave ability is a deadly tool that can launch cars at other players. You'll have to be on your toes if you want to survive this cutthroat competition.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Best experienced with a controller (Both XBox and PS4 controllers are supported), but mouse and keyboard controls are available as well.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Requires a 64 Bit Operating System.</em></p>\n<p><em>Doesn't yet work on Mac.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Installation Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Download the .zip file and extract the folder somewhere you can find it easily. This is where you'll launch the game from whenever you want to play it.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure not to remove the executable from the folder or else it will cease to function until it's put back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When launching the game for the first time you may encounter a Windows Smart Screen error. Don't worry there's nothing wrong, the game just isn't registered with Microsoft. Simply click \"more info\" and select \"run anyway\". It shouldn't pop up again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's it! Thank you so much for your support. Have fun!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Lead Programmer: John Pinckney</p>\n<p>Art Director: Quinn Richman</p>\n<p>Lead Artist: Mike Doyle</p>\n<p>Music and Sound Effects</p>\n<p>We do not own any of the music or sound effects used in this game.
