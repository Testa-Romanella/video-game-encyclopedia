Toontown is a massively multiplayer online game built for kids, teens, and adults of all ages. Create your own Toon and join the never-ending battle against the &quot;Cogs&quot;, who want to turn Toontown into their latest business venture.</p>\n<p>Disney&#39;s Toontown Online started in 2003 as the first family-oriented MMO of its kind. Unfortunately, much to the player&#39;s dismay, Disney announced the game&#39;s closure in August of 2013 due to budget cuts and changes in management at Disney Online. Toons were given one final month to have the time of their life in the Tooniverse before the game would be closed down seemingly forever... But luckily, &quot;forever&quot; didn&#39;t even last for an hour.</p>\n<p>On September 19, 2013 -- the day of Toontown Online&#39;s closure -- Toontown Rewritten announced that for the past month, a band of players known as the &quot;Toontown Rewritten Team&quot; had been working on the possibility to keep Toontown alive. The seemingly impossible task became a reality, and by the end of October, Toontown Rewritten was online and allowing a small amount of Alpha testers to enter the game.</p>\n<p>Toontown Rewritten picked up where Toontown Online left off, but the game wasn&#39;t all there quite yet. Many months were spent reverse-engineering and redeveloping the original server architecture to restore Toontown to its full former glory. The team was not only working to restore Toontown&#39;s gameplay, but the entire essence of Toontown itself. The story was developed, limited-time events continued, new features were added, and to this day the game is still actively updated with new content!</p>\n<p>Toontown Rewritten has now grown to over 1,900,000 registered players, with thousands of players playing at almost any given time of day.</p>\n<p>Now that you know about us, we have a question for you: Are YOU Toon Enough?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T02:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4bf1bf598935b5c4e6d2d3af82adf9.jpg", "website": "https://www.toontownrewritten.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
