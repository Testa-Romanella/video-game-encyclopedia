{"id": 95766, "slug": "brave-hero-yuusha", "name": "Brave Hero Yuusha", "name_original": "Brave Hero Yuusha", "description": "<p>What better way to spend an evening than gathered around listening to a classic tale of a brave hero saving a princess from a sinister demon lord bent on ruling the world? Sure, it may be the same story you've heard time and time again, but don't old stories get better with age? <br/> <br/>So here we find our usual crew. A hero, a demon lord, and a princess all congregating to tell the story of the hero's triumph and the defeat of a great evil. Everyone here know their role and exactly how to carry it out. But what happens when the story doesn't go exactly as we know it? What if someone were to rewrite the story to something no one within it knows how to enact? Who's responsibility is it to put the story back on its track and find the happy ending we all know and love? <br/> <br/> <br/>Brave Hero Yuusha is a satirical love-letter to an older, simpler time of role-playing games when one's mission was solely to rid the world of a great evil and save the land. But nobody would be content if we played such a thing straight. Instead, players can look forward to a trope-shattering romp built with visuals heavily inspired from older RPGs; namely Dragon Quest, Hydelide, and Destiny of an Emperor, with extra emphasis on the former. Arm yourselves to the teeth and face off against a rogue's gallery of monsters and strange creatures as you journey to piece this broken narrative back to the way it should be! <br/> <br/>The full game is now available for download. You do not need the Ace RTP to play!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/87306b5c947b21c277b80f9818921be6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Torch60"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
