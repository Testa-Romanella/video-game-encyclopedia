Try to avoid letting it eat any chips and gravy, for this will only increase its power.</p>\n<p>A silly game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2021 (theme: \"Joined together\"). Originally I wasn't going to enter, but at like 10pm on the Friday I had a silly idea and decided to just go for it. Time limit was 2 days, but actual time spent is probably closer to ~16 hours. It's not polished in any way, it's very slapped together, my main goal was to have fun making something that made me laugh.<br/></p>\n<p>Yes, it's possible to get to the top, I know because I did it (after many tries and plenty of frustration). If you make it, let me know your time taken (it'll tell you in the end screen)!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Controller (recommended): left joystick moves left hand, right joystick moves right hand. L2/R2 to grab.</p>\n<p>Keyboard (possible but way harder): WASD moves left hand, IJKL moves right hand. V/N to grab.</p>\n<p>(Hint for if you're having trouble getting off the ground: try holding up on both hands and alternating grabbing)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Various sound effects from Freesound.org (thanks to users rafaelpicoli, zepurple, and LloydEvans09). Music generated using MuseTree (tool created by Steven Waterman). Everything else by Dylan Jaide White.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Pythar for suggesting the food be chips &amp; gravy instead of bread.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/236c528160b4116545de40050ffb8d29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dylanjaide"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
