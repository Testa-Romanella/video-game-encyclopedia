{"id": 817861, "slug": "isles-away", "name": "Isles Away", "name_original": "Isles Away", "description": "<p>'Isles Away' is the result of the Text-Based Game Jam (July, 2022).</p>\n<p>We had one week to create a narrative-based game, where we could ONLY use a terminal. No audio was allowed and art was only allowed for illustrations.</p>\n<p>This jam gave birth to my first ever story branch-heavy game. It was quite the thrill as there was little time to come up with a story that would feel interesting to read and interactive enough. I hope you like it and here's a bit about the story: <br/></p>\n<p>You and your three friends have stranded on an inhabited island. See what happens! (Yes, I do not want to spoil more!)<br/></p>\n<p>I used Unity to make this story-driven game a reality. <br/>We had one week for the jam, but I\u00a0 had to make most of it during the evenings. Ultimately, I ended up developing this game in about 25 hours time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T16:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34d/34d2a5189a20a04d45b30fc7c1427b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Boone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
