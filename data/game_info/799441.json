But who would ever hire the man who drove a mega-corporation to ruin? None other than Drake's former coworkers and employees who return to offer a hand or perhaps ask for help themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your choices early on decide who you'll work for, but there's more than the 9 to 5 here. Uncover what truly tanked the family business. Learn about secrets hidden from the public and the corporate eye.\u00a0 <strong>No one is perfect, but you have to decide what sins can be forgiven...that is if you can find out what sins have been committed. Will you be just Another Assistant?</strong></p>\n<p>If you'd like early access to updates and the ability to vote and have a say on what comes in later updates, consider supporting us on Patreon at:</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/blackdoorgames<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Now let's talk about Features-</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Mystery:\u00a0</strong>Uncover the dark secrets of your friends, coworkers, and bosses.</li><li><strong>Adventure:\u00a0</strong>Venture out into space, the wilderness, or city life in routes that vary from early on.</li><li><strong>Romance:\u00a0</strong>No matter what you're into be it guys, girls, robots, or something with fur (yes we went there), there's a little of everything for you. That includes completely platonic routes as well for those who aren't interested in the hormones or lovey-dovey stuff.\u00a0Some romantic routes can only be reached through the big\u00a0\u00a04 main routes so who you start with may not be who you spend the most time with later on.</li><li><strong>Routs:\u00a0</strong>There are four main routes that we're starting with, but each will lead to several branching paths. Stories are still underway as our first build is set to release Friday, June 10th, but there is plenty to see. We currently have a lot of story written, but it takes a bit of time to build out.\u00a0New builds of Another Assistant will be coming regularly, so join the story now.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Lore:\u00a0</strong>Learn about different aliens, and Artificial life, some of which are more human than others. Get deep into the history of Earth's place in the galaxy as well as Drake's family and friends.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Mini-games:\u00a0</strong>In our next update, there will be several minigames that help you uncover secrets. Do well and you'll earn hints. Do poorly and you'll get nothing or possibly worse.</li><li><strong>Music:\u00a0</strong>We don't have a sound designer on this project, but we did our best to put together a mix of music and sound that helps build up the story. We recommend listening with headphones for the best experience, but we won't be hurt if you chose to turn a few things down here and there.\u00a0</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T06:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88ee5b38b307472bd43afe42a10d0964.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BlackDoor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
