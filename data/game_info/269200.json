The concept's pretty simple. You control a snake which, as it eats fruit, grows longer. You die if you run into yourself which gets progressively harder as the snake gets larger. I also put in some bombs which you have to avoid.</p>\n<p>The twist in this version is that, while normally you can control which way the snake turns, in this case since you've only got one button the direction the snake turns will depend on when you push the button. There's an arrow pointing in the direction the snake will turn which switches back and forth\u00a0from left to\u00a0right and so if you want to go in a particular direction you have to time\u00a0it correctly.</p>\n<p>To be clear, you can press any key or even the mouse. They all do the same thing so they function as \"one button\" for the purposes of the game.</p>\n<p>All sound is from Soundsnap.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01bd9ae5e1319a0c96fb5556ddb29b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Theta and Pi Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
