It is an endless, round based PvE \"shooter\".\u00a0There are many lessons I learned when making this game and I plan to put them to use in my next game. There are no actual settings so sorry for the loud noises and for controls I will have them listed below. All of the of the sound bits/music were gathered from open sourced websites, if anyone wants the credits for them\u00a0I can go find them again. All of the assets were also free from the Unity Asset Store. I am also aware that the game has a plethora of bugs, but I will not be fixing them anytime soon.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement- AWSD &amp; Mouse : Jump -Spacebar</p>\n<p>Shoot/Throw (Reload)- Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Change Perspective- F</p>\n<p>Change Weapon- C</p>\n<p>Pause- Escape Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T08:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dc/3dc1eb8aac27cb456ad4780704c84dd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KungFuz1"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
