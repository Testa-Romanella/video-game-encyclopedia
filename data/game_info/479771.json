Race against 15 other minivans. Race against a friend in split-screen mode.<br/><br/>Hopefully your computer's powerful enough to run this at 30 frames per second. I wish I were joking.</p>\n<p>Created for the Grid Grind Jam at Glorious Trainwrecks, combining the elements \"van,\" \"garden,\" and \"Clark Stanley.\" This game originally came to me in a dream - a 2.5d racing game like <em>F-Zero</em> or <em>Super Mario Kart</em>, but with minivans.\u00a0\"This could be hilarious,\" I thought. I was right. <br/></p>\n<p>Windows only.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>Paul Schroeder made the music. It's great!\r\n<br/>He's got a Twitter. The game's soundtrack is on Bandcamp.<br/>I also have a Twitter. I have a website with more games on it too.<br/>Thank you Gisbrecht for the transparent Clark Stanley cutout!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>WASD to move player 1<br/>Arrow keys to move player 2\r\n<br/>Enter/space to confirm choices in the menu<br/>Esc to quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T02:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f53a17ab2eb2155ef4900d6c12262380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Higgins"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
