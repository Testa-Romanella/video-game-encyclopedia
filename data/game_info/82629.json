So, is it better to try and do it yourself and do everything alone? Or gather a few friends and all look together to try and bust some high scores?<br/><br/>No matter how you decide to play it, in addition to the default \"Cooperative\" mode, two other play modes are also available!<br/>\u2022 The \"Search\" mode will show off your dexterity and will require you to be as fast as possible to empty a screen full of symbols: perfect for your training as ninja master.<br/>\u2022 The \"Versus\" mode will split the screen of your iPad in two, and will allow you to face off against one of your friends in a frenzied battle, so that they can finally recognize your well-deserved supremacy (at least in terms of efficiency at emptying screens).<br/><br/>-- <br/>And now, a few fake quotes transcribing the emotions you may experience by owning (And playing) the game:<br/><br/>\u25ba \"Before, I had serious back issues.
