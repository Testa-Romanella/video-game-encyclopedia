Get lost in a wide world of precarious platforming that we hope will take you back to a simpler time. </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore an open world platformer.</li>\n<li>Zoom between shrines and fast-travel to new areas if you get stuck.</li>\n<li>Delve five unique dungeon areas each with their own motif and music.</li>\n<li>Find all 777 coins to uncover a secret ending.</li>\n<li>Charming music by Pete Gresser (Reimagine: The Game)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n\t(\r\n\tPRESSKIT)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>KEYBOARD</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Z, X, C or J, K, L: Jump, Zoomout (hold), Warp (hold)</li>\n<li>Arrow Keys or WASD: Movement</li></ul>\n<p><strong>GAMEPAD IS SUPPORTED!</strong></p>\n<ul><li>(For <strong>MAC</strong>, please see this image for controller settings.)</li><li>(For <strong>LINUX</strong>, please see this image for controller settings set via jstest-gtk.)</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DOUBLE-JUMP</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBy pressing Jump again while in the air after jumping, you Double-Jump. You can only do this once, until you touch the ground again. Jump height is fixed, so if you want to vary the height of your jumps, time your Double-Jump accordingly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DROP-DOWN\r\n\t</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHold Down then press Jump to drop down through certain platforms. If you're quick, you can use the Double-Jump to hop back up on the platform you just dropped through.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>FAST-TRAVEL</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOnce you've found a Fast-travel shrine, hold Map then press Left or Right to cycle between discovered shrines, and Rex's current position. Releasing Map warps Rex to the selected shrine.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>FOLLOW THE COINS!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThey're like a breadcrumb trail. If one way seems too hard, try another way.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SCORE ATTACK!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe more coins you collect before touching a checkpoint flag, the higher the score when the coins get banked at the flag. Skip a checkpoint if you're confident you can complete an upcoming section without dying.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PERMADEATH MODE!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor a challenge, attempt to collect all 777 coins before touching a single checkpoint flag. In this mode, death restarts you at the beginning. This is the only way to reach the maximum possible score. This is not easy. Please do not attempt.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Average completion time: Around an hour.</em></li>\n<li><em>Difficulty: Medium / Hard (varies)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>VERSION INFORMATION: </strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please refer to Development Log</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>**** LINUX and MACOS versions provided as-is, and cannot be supported. ****</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Created by: shysaursoft</strong><br/>\n<strong>Music by: Peter Gresser</strong><strong>Published by: Pixeljam</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/><strong>OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><strong>Intel i5 @ 3.40GHz / 8GB RAM / Windows 64 / GeForce 970</strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWhile the game might work fine on lower specs, we cannot guarantee a smooth gameplay experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bab/bab05e99b03a68c3adca2a2fcc17c75d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["shysaursoft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
