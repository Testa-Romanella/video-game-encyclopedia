However, just like in the real world this is a very complex topic. A lot of parameters depend on each other and are mostly understood  only with profound knowledge, which makes it especially hard for designers to tweak them and to get an predictable outcome. For example just wanting to make a vehicle accelerate faster, you have to tweak torque which makes the wheel spin. The spin depends on tire friction. Friction depends on the spin speed of the wheel, which depends on the wheel radius, and the list goes on.<br/></p>\n<p>So the goal of this project is to simplify the vehicle system as much as possible, while still making it feel like you are driving a vehicle. That means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parameters are easy to understand for designers and dont have dependency between each other</li>\n<li>Separate physics from the view model to gain complete artistic freedom</li></ul>\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 Basis\r\n<p>The implementation of this project is based on the Rocket League talk, \"It IS Rocket Science! The Physics of Rocket League Detailed\" and the talk from Vicarious Visions \"Supercharged! Vehicle Physics in Skylanders\" from GDC.</p>\n\r\n\ud83d\udd27\u00a0 Controls\r\n<ul><li>W, S - Throttle, Break</li><li>A, D - Steer</li><li>Spacebar - Jump</li></ul>\n\n\r\nAttributions\r\n<ul><li>Race track models by Kenney under CC0 1.0</li><li>Car model by Azusa under CC BY 4.0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T05:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/15706c3fb0a280e3342951747182fa03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SystemNobody"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
