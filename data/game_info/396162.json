But in the meantime, please try out my little game and let me know what you think.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made with Unity<br/>Sound effects were created with SFXR -\u00a0http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html<br/>Music created with Ecrett -\u00a0https://ecrettmusic.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T02:37:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebf24e88ca42118ed40f37215a8e6c4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4Digit"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
