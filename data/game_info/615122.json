There are 5 game rounds in this game, and scorekeeping is done separately for the 5 rounds. In each round, 13 deals are played. In every deal, each player throws one card, so four cards make a deal. Thirteen tricks make a Round. Five rounds make a game of Callbreak.<br/><br/>The gameplay<br/> All of the 52 cards are distributed equally in the counterclockwise direction among four players. Each player gets 13 cards (thirteen patti) each. After the cards are distributed, each player should declare their bid (Call) for the round. The Call means the number of deals that the player insists on winning in that particular round. The Call is made based on the cards in the hands of individual players. Every player must declare their Call between 1 to 8. For every round, you must look at the cards carefully, make a bid for the number of deals you think you can win.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to break the call/bid made by another player. <br/><br/>After bidding, the dealing starts. The player on the right-hand side of the person who distributed the card throws his card for the first deal. Then the three players throw one card each one by one. The person who throws the next card must try to beat the thrown cards on that deal. Whoever throws the biggest card wins the deal. Subsequently, the winner of each deal throws the first card for the next deal. In every deal, each player must throw the same suit card as the first thrower as well as they must throw a card such that they beat all the previously thrown cards on that deal.
