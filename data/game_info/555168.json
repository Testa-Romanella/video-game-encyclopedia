Moreover I effectively only had 1 day for this jam since my schedule was unfortunately very cluttered this weekend. Very bad timing.</p>\n<p>As a result... what came out was only... a bashing simulator rather than a fighting game. There are so many stuffs I wanted to add -- in particular I imagine a final skill in my mind where the fusion of Clownpiece and Utsuho's attack is in full display: shooting both MOON and SUN!!! But of course, I\u00a0couldn't add it in the end due to time constraint m(_ _;)m</p>\n<p>Anyway, enjoy the bashing simulator. It's very half-baked submission I admit; but I hope some Touhou fan can somewhat smile at this... or sth... ;_;</p>\n<p>P.S.: Yeah. I love Clownpiece (and Utsuho) and I hate Meiling. Got a problem with that?
