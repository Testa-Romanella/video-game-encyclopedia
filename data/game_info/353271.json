Press 'A' when magnet is in close radius to grab a block, and press it once more to drop it. LT &amp; RT are causing engines to stop, whereas RB &amp; LB are reversing its flow. Your goal is to move blocks to the truck, stacking them as high as possible and avoiding collisions on your way there.<br/><br/>Developed by extremely well-humored team of three people, magically self-organized themselves on the event kickoff. Powered by Godot Engine. <br/></p>\n<p>Playing with audio on is strongly advised(or Michael will be even more sad than on the picture).<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T11:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33ed76b71846e2429f57fe8493fb6a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nowan", "mlazowik", "RMDragonheart"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
