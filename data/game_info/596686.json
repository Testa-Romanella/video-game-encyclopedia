However, the littering of humans into the park\u2019s lake has formed sludge-like creatures, vicious and in pain, with their intent to wipe out all living life, the park life is now in danger. You as the player will play as a duck armed with a modified toaster gun, shoot your way through hoards of sludge creatures, cleanse the lake of its rubbish and use your grappling hook to swing yourself around and into enemies for a stunning blow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through the tides of battle pieces of the stage will start to fall, the flimsy rafters you battle upon won\u2019t hold for long, eventually falling into the water, but don\u2019t worry new rafters will float up giving an ever-changing battlefield that you must constantly adapt to.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Using your nifty grapple hook you can propel yourself across the battlefield and pull yourself through enemies for stunning blow, leaving them paralyzed for a moment. But watch out as the waves progress the types of enemies you will encounter will change and become larger in number, increasing the difficulty. Let\u2019s not forgot your trusty toaster gun! The creatures of the deep are allergic to bread and any contact with it will make them spontaneously combust. Killed enemies drop scrap parts that can be turned into weapon upgrades to fend off larger enemy numbers. How long can you survive?\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:30:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8883fe6d4efca4afe0878c0200aecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JT_Art"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
