I like the idea of gambling health for exploration - but I wanted to get involved in little stories as well.</p>\n<p>This is a basic attempt at this idea. I'm still struggling to get text to work in Unity, apologies for the quality of this demo.</p>\n<p>Each room in the dungeon is essentially a mini-game made with Ink, a narrative scripting language. Currently I divide the rooms into \"passages\" and \"dead ends\" so that a room works better in context. Taking this idea further would involve \"gates\" and \"keys\", so that the player could carry items and use them . But this would require a dependency graph, lest a key be spawned behind a gate.</p>\n<p>I've attached the Ink files I've used in this demo. They will run standalone in Inky (a free editor and test bed for Ink) - these rooms are basic and don't require items or special abilities to pass.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b3602e3ed238100e72ab9fc96e1a0040.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["st33d"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
