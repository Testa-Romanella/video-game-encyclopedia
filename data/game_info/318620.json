In one side the first player controls a little monster that can move between some platform in 2D, his main goal is to scape from the other player. On the other side the second player controls a big monster, but more specifically his mouth! He will have to rotate that mouth and with a unique slam, try to smash the other player. If the player that controls the mouth achieve to smash the other player he wins a point, if not, the other player wins a point. The game is very nervous and the roles change very quickly! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T03:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce9/ce93c81efe04f582a8bc3e273c2c8eb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elias Bennour"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
