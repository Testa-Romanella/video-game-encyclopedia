That means it DOES NOT work with Tobii, but a regular old mouse instead.* Kinetic Cauldron is a game developed on Unity using the Tobii Eyetracking controller. You are the apprentice of a telekinesis master and you need to practice. Help your master cook a potion using only your telekinetic waves. Focus your sight on the ingredient you need for the potion and move around with your sight onto the cauldron. Tobii's Eyetracking controller is heavily recommended for this game, as well as enabling it's Gaze Trace utility. Have fun using telekinesis, but be careful. You don't want to blow your master's lab up, right?</p><p>Jam Site: GranadaJam</p><p>Diversifiers: Beyond the doors of perception (Tobii Sponsored) :Use Tobii's eye tracking device to extend your player's view in-game and break the 4th wall! </p><p>Technologies: Eye tracking equipment, Unity (any product)Credits: </p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Programming</p><p>Laura Del Pino Diaz</p><p>Manuel Adrian Galvez Gil</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>Elena Garcia Bravo</p><p>Game Design</p><p>Africa Curiel Galvez</p><p><strong>Sound</strong></p><p>Oscar Rivero Melo</p><p>Ismael Barea Insua</p><p><strong>Special Thanks</strong> </p><p>Granada Jam</p><p>Estudio Nemo</p><p>ArteBit</p><p>Global Game Jam</p><p>Ferry Hadriyan for the font \"Chocolate Heart\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d968e7565eedcb193bf07bd1c1e48c50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GranadaJam"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
