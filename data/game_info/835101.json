As it turns out, Cyberhunk Industries is way ahead of you on the cyborg thing. Their latest failed experiment - the demonic robotic zombies called \u201chunks\u201d - have been set free, and are out for blood (or\u2026 maybe oil).<br/><br/><br/>To survive, you\u2019ll need to fight off increasingly large and fast waves of hunks that will hunt you down through three hand-crafted levels. Learn how to navigate these arenas, evade the swarm of enemies, and start cracking some metal skulls to earn money!<br/><br/><h3>EQUIP YOURSELF</h3>Explore each level and spend your hard-earned cash to outfit yourself with six unique weapons, increasing your combat options. Get up-close and personal with the Double Duty Shotgun or blow your enemies away with the C-37 Payloader\u2019s rockets.<br/><br/><br/>Fending off a wave of hunks will reward you and your companions with a power-up that can drastically increase your killing potential. The more you find, the more powerful you get. Finding more than one of the same power-up will increase its effect. Up your attack speed with the Super Shades, and fire extra shots when mid-air with Dogfight.<br/><br/><h3>TEAM UP</h3>Fight back the mechanized freaks by yourself, or play online co-op supporting up to four players. Take on the hunks together, and revive your buddies when they\u2019re overtaken!<br/><br/><br/><h3>BECOME THE CYBERHUNK</h3>Each level contains the HUNKIFIER, a machine capable of powering up your arsenal even more. Find the HUNKIFIER, save up enough money, and bring your favorite weapon to upgrade it and go from strong to ridiculously strong.<br/><br/>Collect all the power-ups and hunkify all your weapons to become the Cyberhunk and escape from the horde\u2026<br/><br/><h3>\u2026or will it be that simple?</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T04:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e2ff352a3141418c0162bd74cccd4fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 437, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Birch Tree Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Birch Tree Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
