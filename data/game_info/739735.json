{"id": 739735, "slug": "stapel", "name": "Stapel", "name_original": "Stapel", "description": "The Stapel is a game of your reaction speed. You stack rectangular figures one on top of the other by timely fixation at the moment the figure passes over the previous one. If you do this a little later or earlier, part of the shape will be cut off to match the rest of the shapes. Management is simple, using the mouse. Your goal is to build a high tower of pieces, and your mistakes will bring the narrowing of the building closer and the end of the game. Good luck with your game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T04:14:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf98cc797a64f228b857aa6a91f767aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuickBobber"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QuickBobber"], "esrb_rating": null}
