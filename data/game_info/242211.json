We believe simple ones are the best. The ones that entertained us in the old days and the simplicity was relaxing and fun ! They simply make our childhood dreams. The classic oldies that really never get old.<br/>In AirFox, we travel to the 80's and the cartridge games age. We bring you back to that childhood dream of playing an airforce pilot, sent to big missions to defend their country.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/45928af3fa6b171f2a941e727cc7ea9b_P1mT84P.jpg", "website": "http://tangogames.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mehdi Karimi"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Mehdi Karimi"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
