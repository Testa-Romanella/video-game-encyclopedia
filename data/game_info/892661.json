There are other squares around the grid that the player's square connects to and moves together as one.</p>\n<p>There are also spikes around that destroy\u00a0a connected square each time the player moves into it. The player's goal is to strategically complete the specific polyominoes in each level.</p>\n<p>This was heavily inspired by Tetris and the idea of Tetrominoes. Tetrominoes are shapes created with squares that are connected to each other. This led to the goal of the game of trying to create specific polyominoes, which\u00a0are the same as Tetrominoes except that they can be made of any number of squares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created with the help of Michael Parkin and Ashish\u00a0Juggpal. Thank you for working on this with me!</p>\n<p>Date: August 2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:01:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/772/7722b1eaf74531a4e8a7874558c658f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Payal Chana"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
