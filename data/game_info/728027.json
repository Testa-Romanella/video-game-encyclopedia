It was my first time working with Pixel Art and a Turn-Based game of this nature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was mainly a project to learn new elements of engine work and experiment with new aspects of game design. Pixel art was something that had interested me so I wanted to learn and get a feel for it. This style of gameplay is also something I have a great interest in, so focusing more on educating myself I feel was greatly beneficial.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:34:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8bf/8bff694a62b7d61f0a65a871c6c4cd5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Dalton"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
