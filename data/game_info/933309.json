The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. This game is designed for two players.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Click here to read the instructions on how to play.</p>\n<p>This game\u00a0joins the \"BASIC10Liner\" competition 2023.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since it joined this competition, the game itself is modest in size, and the given source code respects strong constraints on the length of each line (category:\u00a0<strong>PUR-120</strong>) and it does not rely on third party libraries</p>\n<p>The source code is available on this repository.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HOW MUCH HAS ugBASIC HELPED?</strong></p>\n<p>This cross-platform game would not have been possible without using\u00a0<strong>ugBASIC</strong>\u00a0: it is an isomorphic language and it\u00a0has cross compilers that works on Linux and Windows, that\u00a0directly converts high level algorithms\u00a0into the assembly equivalent for the given CPU / computer.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Developing for multiple platforms requires very little effort because the source does not have to be adapted. With a<strong>\u00a0single source code you can obtain programs for multiple retro computers</strong>, even very different from each other. Moreover,\u00a0each target can have a dedicated optimizer, which allows to achieve very interesting results while leaving the BASIC code fully readable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:51:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7e66f9b4904e1b6a229f1657f50323a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spotlessmind1975"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
