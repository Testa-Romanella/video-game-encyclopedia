Do you relapse back to the first hour or continue on? Relapsing back to the first hour will revert all the decisions you've made from then.</p>\n<p>All materials and consumables will be lost, however all tools and key items will be kept. Relapsing allows you to reattempt some puzzles as some may have different ways to be solved, yielding different results!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Time System</p>\n<p>The time system is not just a countdown until \"Game Over\". Within an 11 hour time period you will encounter various events depending on the time of day, until the monsters overrun the orphanage completely.
