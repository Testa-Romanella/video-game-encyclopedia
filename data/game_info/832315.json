Grow 10 tomatoes to win.</p>\n<p>Player 1 -\u00a0W A S D,\u00a0 \u00a0G, H\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Player 2 - Arrow\u00a0Keys\u00a0 \u00a0.\u00a0 \u00a0/</p>\n\n<p>Made by Michael @TooMuchTomato</p>\n<p>with music by Jeff @JTN191</p>\n\n<p>I streamed the full development of this game on twitch\u00a0\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/toomuchtomato</p>\n\n<p>This is a prototype for a minigame that will be included in my full-length puzzle adventure game FORKLIFT FLOWERPOT!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wishlists on Steam help me a lot!\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073330/FORKLIFT_FLOWERPOT</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Action Phase</strong> - Draw and play 5 cards. Cards can give your character resources or alter the terrain where your flowerpot is on the board . Switch between your hand and the board to carefully execute your plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Draft Phase -\u00a0</strong>use your resources (banked rain tokens) to purchase new cards for your deck.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring Phase -\u00a0</strong>A random tile is chosen for scoring. If a player owns the tile, they gain 1 point along with the modifiers on that tile. For each round number, an additional tile is scored, ramping up the stakes. If able, the scoring tile will have +1 tomato token added to it after scoring.</p>\n<p><strong>RESOURCES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wind - </strong>allows a player to move their flowerpot one space on the board.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Rain - </strong>claims an untaken space, adds to banked rain token when played on a space you already own.</p>\n<p><strong>Blight token</strong>- Adds a blight token to this space. Blight scores -1 for the player owner and will replace any tomato tokens on the tile.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomato token</strong>- Scores +1 tomato for the player owner. Can not replace a blight tile.</p>\n<p><strong>ADVANCED TECHNIQUES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Holding Tokens</strong>\u00a0- Tokens can be held by pressing the action button in board mode. They do not score points when held (although I will probably change this in the post-jam version)</p>\n<p><strong>Blight Stacking </strong>- stack a bunch of blight together and drop it on your opponent for devastation</p>\n<p><strong>Tomato Stacking </strong>- steal and aquire tomatoes and stack them on your own tiles for potential quick wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource Hoarding -\u00a0</strong>all resources persist between rounds. Go ahead, save your rain drops for a big purchase. Save your wind to drop a huge blight stack on your opponent.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS IN JAM VERSION</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Score indication text is off sometimes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a93179e9c61053f8fb6e1a361d82146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Too Much Tomato", "jtn191"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
