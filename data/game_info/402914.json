It's not pretty but it's something i'm proud about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not knowing how to program on C#\u00a0and no experience with Unity 2D I decided to make a game for the next\u00a0school project.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game is still in need of map design and cool futures but with limited time this became the state of my first game.</p>\n<p>My attempt at making a 2D Platformer game with Unity 2D. Designed to be hard,\u00a0\u00a0similar to IWBTB in a way but not close.</p>\n<ul><li>Use arrow keys to move</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls </strong>- Feels a bit off since i tried to make the character (slime) movement more slimy.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Menu</strong> - 2/3 buttons work, the play button and exit. Options Button works but does nothing. When Play is pressed, to QUIT game you have to tab out and close the program or finish the entire game and at the end there will be a QUIT button to press.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Maps/scenes\u00a0</strong>- Total of 4 scenes. 1 is main menu, 2 tutorial level, 3 main level, 4 end credits.</p>\n<p><strong>Music\u00a0</strong>- Work in progress. Didn't manage to make a good song in time so I had to rely on NCS music.</p>\n<p>Music Credit to: Lensko - Cetus _NCS Release_\u00a0 and\u00a0Link - Jim Yosef</p>\n<p>End Credit Music:\u00a0333811__shadydave__feelings-of-twilight-loop<br/></p>\n\n<p>Better update maybe in the future</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72f/72f4b8cad9ef02ddedbdfdb77835196e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GoodVibes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
