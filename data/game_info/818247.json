Challenge yourself to end each level in record time! Exploit the game's physics to your advantage. Watch out for the different types of obstacles and be ready for the ones that will be added soon. Get Coins and buy over 13 unique skins!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>This game is in development and it is planned to add at least 50 levels and make more after full release. The game was originally intended to release early access on Google Play in July 2022, but Google is taking too long to verify my Developer Console payment, so I decided to release it in Itch.io. When I finally get that damn Developer Account, I will release the game in the Play Store and continue the development in itch.io and Google Play.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Note:</strong>\n<p>Because I don't have a Developer Console Account yet, the in-app purchases don't work and they are temporarily disabled. Also, you can give feedback on the state of the game and tell me how to improve it since this is my first ever game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Support and donations will be amazing since I have more incoming game projects and I need to survive to make them. Thanks in advance for playing. Stay tuned for the updates and new games!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T08:18:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24cc7382614fffe72374bab4e4394949.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Esbanest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
