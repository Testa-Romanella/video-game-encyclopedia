Here's how to play.</p>\n<p>In Card City, you manage 3 different resources: your population/people, your food, and your money. Each building is represented by a card. There are two types of cards: active and passive cards. Passive cards do the ability listed without you having to do things, and active cards require you activate them. Each card has a cost in resources. <br/></p>\n<p>Each turn you have 3 actions. These actions can be buying a card or activating an active card. Then, there may be a disaster. Each disaster has a different effect. Sometimes this may destroy more resources than you have. If so, you lose. Try to manage the city better for the mayor next time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1fecf0fa08c8c73013309de387b9d4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skiscratcher"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
