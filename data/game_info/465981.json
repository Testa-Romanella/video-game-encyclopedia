The first level plays out like a regular platforming level, However the second and the third level have fliped controls therefore making a game out of control. The blue platforms give a jump boost and the yellow ones do not allow movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made by Lev Kreyvenko, Maxim Okhorzin, Misha Akimov, and Pyotr Akimov.
