It\u2019s\r\naim to discover the connection in between Mass-Surveillance, Self-Surveillance and Self Exposure.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>- The origin of Camera surveillance\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Camera use as a surveillance tool can be trace back to nineteenth-century, base on Josh Lauer\u2019s research, it\u2019s all start\r\nwith the portable camera. The portable camera was first introduced in 1880s, US. The convenience of portable camera\r\nmakes it easier to take photos without people knowing it, as Lauer\u2019s</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>- Panopticon and CCTV\u00a0</p>\n<p>Foucault described \u201cThe Panopticon is a machine for dissociating the see/being seen dyad: in the peripheric ring, one is\r\ntotally seen, without ever seeing; in the central tower, one sees everything without ever being seen. \u201d It\u2019s similar to CCTV, the\r\npower relationship is clear in the condition of watch and being watch. The surveillance system continuously judge and\r\nchange citizen\u2019s behavior to reach the standards set by those in power.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>- The mass surveillance and self exposure\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nowadays mass surveillance technology not only applying by the public CCTV cameras, also private surveillance and\r\npotentially private mass collection of data. As Jeremie Zimmermann suggest in the book <em>Cypherpunks </em>\u201cIt\u2019s not only the\r\nstate-sponsored surveillance, it\u2019s the question of privacy, the way data is being handled by third parties and the knowledge\r\nthat people have of what is being done with the data...with Facebook you see the behavior of users who are very happy to\r\nhand out any kind of personal data, and can you blame people for not knowing where the limit is between privacy and\r\npublicity?\u201d Here, I ask whether Facebook's success is based on human self exposed behaviors, and what prompted such\r\nbehaviors? Jeremie Zimmermann later suggest that \u201cFacebook makes its business by blurring the line between privacy,\r\nfriends, and publicity. \u201d Meanwhile, Julian Assange added \u201cEven this line between government and corporation is blurred. If\r\nyou look at the expansion in the military contractor sector in the West over the past ten years, the NSA, which was the\r\nbiggest spy agency in the world, had ten primary contractors on its books that it worked with. Two years ago it had over\r\n1,000. So there is a smearing out of the border between what is government and what is the private sector.\u201d Zimmermann\r\nargue with the access of all the google and facebook storage data, these third parties can be the extension of US spying\r\nagencies.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T03:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/9772db9e74eaf6ef508f301f420a5ab7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["awu-lee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
