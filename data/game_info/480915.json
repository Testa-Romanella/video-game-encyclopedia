Making a non-linear game like that is completely new to me and designing puzzles that could be solved in different order while preventing too much unintended solution was a real challenge. But this also led to a few surprises!</p>\n<p>It ended up being HUGE, with ~160 levels/screens, a lot of secrets and a full optional dungeon with secret ending! Which might not have been the ideal thing for a jam but oh well! I spent a lot of time on the saving system too, which is something I had barely done before, so this was kinda hard to manage.</p>\n\r\nSmall warning:\r\n<p>Since it's a Sokoban game, pushing boxes often result in dead ends, so a rewind mechanic is necessary. And Checkpoints too. But the open-ended nature of the game also means that the player can choose to abandon an area and go elsewhere. This could lead to a few softlocks if you're not careful!<br/>So: <strong>If you're leaving an area before completing it</strong> (usually this means reaching a new checkpoint or a new object acting like one) <strong>make sure to use the restart function before leaving. It sends you back to the last checkpoint</strong>!</p>\n<p>I made sure checkpoints were only in safe areas that you can only reach by doing the right thing, so if you have any doubt, just use the restart!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>(can be remapped)</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - WASD / Arrow Keys</li><li>Action - Spacebar / X</li><li>Rewind - Backspace / Z</li><li>Resart - R</li><li>Menu - Escape</li><li>Map - M</li><li>Skill - I</li><li>Stats - J</li></ul>\n\r\nMisc:\r\n<p>This was made in GameMaker Studio 1.4, started around August 5th. I used Beepbox for sounds, and the font m3x6 by Daniel Linssen. Secrets were written by Celim'.</p>\n<p>I'm sure I stole a lot of idea from years of playing PuzzleScrips games too, but I couldn't attribute anything to a specific one, so I'll just say: you should play ENIGMASH.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T03:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bdf73a0cf047d527c3b4df66ee2b74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fachewachewa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
