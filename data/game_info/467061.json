There's nothing random in the game, but that doesn't mean its predictable! Flares come out from suns on a long loop, and comets are pulled towards the nearest sun or black hole.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e11127b1dac26f58b96d6aae15c6976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SodaPOP67"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
