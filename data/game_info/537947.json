The world is roughly set in the 1980s. While he is going for a Business degree, he doesn't know what he really wants to do. He stumbles through life, just getting by. He overthinks everything and can over react as well. <br/><br/>He means well, but tends to cause some chaos along the way. Follow him on his journey with his friends, pets, and others. There are a few options throughout so you can influence the story. The story takes place over a couple of days in the life of Utama.<br/><br/>Please let me know what you thought and if you have any feedback, I'd love to hear from you!<br/>Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy and especially laugh!<br/><br/>WARNING: Contains mild swearing<br/><br/>PS. I ran out of time so I didn't end up making nicer backgrounds or finish all the touch-ups I wanted to. That's the price I pay for procrastinating I guess!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:45:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/504/50452928648e92c3177d3bb860d1a55e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IlDelphino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
