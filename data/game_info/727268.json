So, my idea was something similar but the blocks which fall there are some shapes which are irregular and when you try to rotate the block which is falling there is a 45-50 % chance of it changing it to another block. Which I felt made the game harder and unpredictable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T09:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be570a550f2a9b3a047690cedd88d8b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Siduma"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
