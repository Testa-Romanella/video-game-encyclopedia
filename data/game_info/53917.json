{"id": 53917, "slug": "little-samson", "name": "Little Samson", "name_original": "Little Samson", "description": "<p>Little Samson, known in Japan as Seirei Densetsu Lickle (\u8056\u9234\u4f1d\u8aac\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30eb, &quot;Holy Bell Legend Lickle&quot;), is a 1992 action platformer video game developed by Takeru and published by Taito Corporation for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Taito released the game at the height of the platformer genre&#39;s success, hoping to finally achieve a solid hit on the system with a proven formula, the same way Hudson Soft had done with their Adventure Island series and Capcom with their Mega Man titles. It was notable for having highly detailed graphics for an 8-bit game, seen in the game&#39;s menacing boss characters (which contrasted heavily with the more childlike sprites of the protagonists). In recent years, it has developed a reputation of being one of the most rare and expensive video games in history.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-03T11:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1ad/1adbb989be5b6f03491033b18bf98948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.62, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 7, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Takeru"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
