All of the digits are of different platform types. The Number Pi and the square root of 2 are also levels. There is a map editor, where you can create your own levels. But it isn't as easy as it seems, because you can fall through 8 and 2. There are also platforms for the letters A - G.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>Here are the platform types:</p>\n<ul><li>2 - Pulls you down, and you can fall through it</li><li>6 - Gives you a boost</li><li>8 - You can fall through it</li><li>0 - Pulls you down and stops your speed</li><li>All the other digits are setting their height</li><li>A - Acts like an elevator if you go on it</li><li>B - Falls down if you go on it</li><li>C - Is a static platform</li><li>D - Falls up if you go on it</li><li>F - (=Finish) If you go over it you won</li><li>G - Is a static platform too</li></ul>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>There could be some bugs and features that don't work, so we would be happy for feedback.
