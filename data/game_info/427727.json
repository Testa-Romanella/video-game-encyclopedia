Then several units of wood suitable for crafting will fall out.<br/><strong>\u2022 Bonfires</strong><br/>A bonfire is needed for frying meat and potatoes. It is assembled from sticks and ignited by a flint. To fry food, you need to put raw meat in a fire, wait for the condition and pick up when the meat is ready. Condition can be traced to the changed food icon. The bonfire goes out over time, so it is necessary to throw brushwood (sticks). You can put out a watering can or a bucket of water. Destroyed by any tool, breaking up into sticks.<br/><strong>\u2022 Cultivation of crops</strong><br/>In the game you can grow wheat and potatoes. Wheat seeds can be obtained from tall grass or by the interaction of a hoe with a block of grass. When digging up the soil with a low chance, potatoes or fertilizer may fall out. They can also be found in chests in mines.<br/>To plant, you need to loosen the soil with a hoe and stick the seeds. Crops grow only on moist soil. It automatically becomes wet if there is water nearby. Otherwise, hydration is carried out using a watering can filled with water. The soil dries out over time, so it needs to be watered periodically. The use of fertilizer or bone meal on the soil increases the growth of crops by 2 times.<br/><strong>\u2022 Nutrition</strong><br/>The game implements a hunger system, so the character needs to constantly eat. The following types of food are available: meat, potatoes, bread and berries. Food has a different saturation level. Raw food reduces hunger, but does not saturate, so it is advisable to eat it cooked.<br/>Health is restored automatically if satiety is more than 80%. With a satiety of 50% or less, the character becomes slow, and with complete hunger, he loses health until death.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T07:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503b25b61b0c9b774d9145c2ac057a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 33, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BekkerDev Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BekkerDev Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
