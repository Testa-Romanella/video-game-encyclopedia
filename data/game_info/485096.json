Also be a saboteur to any kind of organized operation that is evil... especially if it's done or supported by a big corporation or the government!<br/>\r\nI figured a flying space shooter game like this was perfect for Hikaru. Except for one thing - most of them involve shooting aliens, but Hikaru loves aliens!<br/>\r\nAlthough I imagine there might be other ways to do it, I thought instead, why not shoot up bigoted earthlings who would hurt her alien friends (or hurt others on Earth, too)? There's plenty of them out there!<br/>\r\nAll to the standards of \"we don't kill our enemies, we just undiscord them\", of course!<br/>\r\nAs well as to the standards of, this game involves using one's imagination, so things don't have to make perfect sense.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlso explore the mysteries of the oniric realm, aka the dream world, and the fact that there is also dimension hopping as a possibility on top of space travel. Ultimately you will have to stop the evil ambitions of a certain individual!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay the \"story mode\" which follows Hikaru, or play the \"arcade mode\" which takes all the dialog out, but, let's you play as all different characters in the same vein as Lovely Warriors of Friendship! The roster for that is still growing and has just started, however.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Shmup gameplay inspired by Wish Project, Q-YO Blaster, etc<br/>\r\n- Play as the Precure and other Lovely Warriors of Friendship<br/>\r\n- Fight mean world leaders, bigots, and other pathogen scum!<br/>\r\n- Purify everything and kill nothing!
