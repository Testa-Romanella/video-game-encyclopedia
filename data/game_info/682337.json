If', a new video game from Outhouse Media.<br/>\nNew game 'Racing Games at 19' is supposed to, his and Outhouse Media's take on racers will be to use physics based game mechanics and turn your head to get towards that goal.\n\nMoves like the drag race that culminates with you aiming for the goal and increasing your speed bank twenty times.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think that's because you're trying to pass the final obstacle whilst avoiding the 50 other riders on the track!\n\nI like game development in theory, but I must admit that sometimes I think about aesthetics. I like a good background of what is included in a video game. Having the ability to really upload an image to the internet, or even copy-paste the image from a GUI like Photoshop, while simple, is a killer feature.\n\nEnter 'Ryken's second game, 'Racing Games At 19'.\n\nThe designers of 'Racing Games At 19' have been developing games for a long time, and after several years of work they have now released the game:\n\n'Ryken's second game :\n\n'Racing Games At 19' has been released in December 2014. The game, as the title suggests, gives you only one goal, and that is to get to the goal. In fact, if you get hit by another car or run over by another vehicle that another rider was in, you will be unable to progress to the next track.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/1383aad2bbe5dfdf7a157569d4df114b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
