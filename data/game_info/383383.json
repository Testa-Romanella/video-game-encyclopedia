When the prince learns that his family\u2019s history isn\u2019t as spotless as he had been told, he endeavors to fix what his family had done wrong and to ensure the continual peace of his kingdom. This will lead the prince to battling the phantoms that prowl the lands, to saving a princess, and to realizing the secrets of his family and his kingdom.<br />\nIt is a story of magic, of whimsical childlike wonder, and of terror and dread.
