{"id": 491939, "slug": "cinnamon-fight", "name": "Cinnamon fight", "name_original": "Cinnamon fight", "description": "<h3>Key features</h3># 2 to 4 players Steam multiplayer (<strong>No singleplayer mode</strong>)<br/># More than 500 unique levels<br/># So many gameplay changing obstacles<br/># 40+ unique weapons<br/>#So much sweets included :)<h3>Basics</h3><strong>Cinnamon fight</strong> is my first game using Unreal engine 4. This game is a  <strong>purely multiplayer game</strong> for you and for up to 3 your friends. Fight againts up to three of your friends or random people and win golden cinnamon throphy. You can play on more than 500 diferent maps and use a wide range of weapons. All maps are unique, contain different weapons and most importantly they contain diferent obstacles which can hurt you or you can use them to crack your enemies.<h3>\u200bMore information</h3><strong>Cinnamon fight</strong> is using fancy graphics which goes hand in hand with mild ambiance music. The only disturbing aspect are your enemies, so your primary goal is to eliminate them. All weapons are really unique, some of them are really good in their firepower, some of them use special bullets, and some of them could be really overpowerd. You have to plan how you want to elimanate your enemies, but be careful, they are going to do the same thing to you, so be always one step ahead. <strong>Keep in mind that what could kill your enemies can kill you as well.</strong><br/>\u200b<br/>The other thing you should be aware of are sweet but deadly obstacles, bonbon spikes, swinging llipops, falling crackers, chocolate balls, milk, and many more.<h3>Future</h3>So for now it is everythink, but in the future you can look forward to see lots of improvements. We are planing to massively improve graphical appearance of the main hero and the game itself. We are also planning to improve movement of the character and add lots of new weapons with new types of bullets which would change the game tactics. With this the new sweet obstacles come hand in hand. New unique obstacles which will make your life and life of your enemies much harder. These changes will also lead to almost tripple the amount of levels. The most wanted thing which we want to implent is going to be the possibility to change the appearance of your character by adding different hats, eyes colors, mouth types, trousers, shoes, jewelery and much more. We are also thinking about adding emotes styles which you are going to unlock via breaking your enemies apart.<br/><br/><br/>We also have lots of other things in our minds and we will try to bring them to you ASAP.
