The Bleak is that person who has no fear of the reaper and wants everyone to seize life by the throat to throttle the best out of it. With hyper focused bluntness you try to shatter any barriers people would have between them and their potential.</p>\n<p>Related to the Daria Morgendorffers, Lydia Deetz's, and Tim Burton style male protagonists that litter those movies. This Skin touches on the aspects of death that people may be curious about and can bring discernment between the states of life, death, and undeath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Curse your enemies, help your friends, and be a chipper conduit between the two states of being. Push people in directions they might be ready for and suffocate them by making them complete destructive actions which may put them at risk!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:02:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0b/b0bf04d1422f49c6234a285961d33eeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
