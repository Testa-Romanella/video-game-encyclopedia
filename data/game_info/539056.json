This is a completely free, volunteer made, multiplayer, satirical parody of common thematic elements found in American broadcast television serieses (yes that's actually a word.) In this game you'll find fast paced classic arena shooter gameplay, bright colors, tons of Easter eggs. and lots of meta references. The early access version of this game will feature a classic style 8v8 map of unique characters being challenged to a paintball match by their evil doppledeaners.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is for aspiring game developers to come together as a <strong>community</strong> to gain experience and to meet different people. We hope you enjoy joining us on this journey and support the continual addition of special and unique game modes. As long as there is interest in this projects continuation and volunteers to make it happen we will strive to improve this project to make it a unique and fun gaming experience for you to enjoy.<br/><br/>Remember! This is a team of volunteers with limited experience in game development and this is still a very early access version. That being said, if you run into something that you think is a bug, it's actually a feature we put in to make this game unique!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:05:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76a/76a799e9946b3eb991618f3ebf823ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Human Beings"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Moto Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
