Have you ever played an RPG as a Hero where you barge into private houses uninvited in search of loot, and smash all the breakable objects right in front of the house inhabitants while they are eating their dinner? If you have, you know the next step is to demand answers, if they have seen someone SUSPICIOUS walking around town, as you quickly skip through the dialogue and proceed to steal everything that is not glued to the floor. The NPC villagers often feel their spirits boosted as the chosen one is passing through town, that is, until the hero smashes everything, and steals all the money that is keeping the NPCs from starving. He may be powerful, full of spells and magical items that could buy a castle, but that worn out piece of underwear in the closet sure may come in handy when fighting the demon lord. Often these actions are enabled by the freedom that the players have in the game, so we decided to flip the script and breathe life into the NPC villagers, giving control to the players, so that they are not robbed of their life savings while looking blankly at the heroes.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>2 Versus 2 multiplayer.</li><li>Customizable characters and rooms.</li><li>Unique Pixel art crafted carefully to provide the players with the most amazing views.</li><li>Custom created sound effects for each of the game's interactions.</li><li>Loads of traps and items to provide the players with all they need for the ultimate Ravage!</li></ul>\n<p>Every Donation will be used to support this project.</p>\n<p>This version of the game includes a solo mode just so that you can explore the map, check the art style and get used to the controls.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aac47f4b83a089035a67694f87fccef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixeldinos"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
