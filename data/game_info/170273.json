Enjoy!</p><p>I've also included a compressed version of the Unity project with all of the source code and assets.</p><p>PLEASE TAKE NOTE:</p><p>1. Only the Windows standalone and web player builds have been tested. I've included builds for OS X and Linux but I can't guarantee they'll work without error.</p><p>2. Due to a current bug with Unity3D fullscreen mode on the standalone builds (and possibly the web player build) doesn't work correctly - the mouse input will be offset by a certain amount. Please stick to using the windowed mode to prevent this :)</p><p>3. Chrome has dropped NPAPI support so you'll need to use another browser (Firefox, IE etc.) if you want to play the game in your browser.<br/></p><p>4. I'm a programmer and the assets make my eyes bleed, too. Please don't hurt me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/145/145356bd7d490a383b9e54efd29f3c29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slandercakes"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
