There is an app for that. \"Bar Fighter\" helps you find likeminded bros to get that extra energy out with a good old street fight. There is a convenient chat system so you can find out if you really dislike each other. No point in fighting a potential buddy!</em></p>\n<p>This is my entry for LD41, it's a mashup of a dating sim and a fighting game. The total time was 25 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I spent too much time on drawing the outfits and making the chat system look nice. I could have used that time to tune up the fighting mechanics, but regardless I'm pretty pleased with the results.</p>\n<p>Tools used: Unity, Bosca Ceoil, Pixelmator, Visual Studio\u00a0</p><p>Game\u00a0Jam Entry:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/$86320</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/554b57b9f1c411480dabd62e47a74de9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pixelome"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
