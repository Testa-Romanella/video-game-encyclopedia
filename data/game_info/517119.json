Is a party game for 2-4 Players. The main idea is to have a turn-based Hide 'n Seek. After you select your player count/ nicknames and Game Settings, you will all spawn in a Map as a Player. Use <strong>F\u00a0</strong> to shoot, <strong>E</strong> to Morph into to selected object and <strong>Q</strong> to morph back to the player form.</p>\n<p><strong>Morph Options: </strong>Big Cactus (2 Forms), Small Cactus (2 Forms), Flower (4 Colors).<br/></p>\n<p>You can define a bullet count when you start the game. Those are the Bullets every player will be able to shoot before they run out of ammo.\u00a0<strong>The bullets won't refill in the game!! </strong>So you gotta use them carefully :D After the Turn Time is over, the current player should hand over the Keyboard to the next player. Its thought so that the others aren't looking when they are inactive.<br/>Its just a little thing i built while i was bored, so basically 4 days. Like a game jam for myself to challenge me :P</p>\n<p>Anyways, have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T05:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a723e197046e321d154d742a59291e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ARez1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
