At first we struggled to think of ideas for the theme \u201cThe other side of the coin\u201d , but decided to not take it literally. The idea behind Elemental Switch is that you have two elements at your disposal like the two sides of a coin, fire and ice. You will need to use different elements at different stages in order to pass through the levels. We were over ambitious at the beginning planning two different abilities for each element but half way through the jam we decided to not go any further with those ideas and focus on what we had already.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team Name</strong></p>\n<p>Digital Impact</p>\n<p><em><strong>Team Members</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Maidens</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p>UE4 Implementation / 3D Modelling / Audio Production\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Jack Townend</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p>UI Art / Gameplay mechanics design/ Audio Production\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Lindley</strong> -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Level Design / Level Polishing\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Rhys Lunn</strong> -</p>\n<p>Initial ideas generation<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:24:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cb9db47c097d233a607f001a7a9132b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigitalImpact"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
