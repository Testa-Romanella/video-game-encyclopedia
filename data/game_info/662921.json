Please read the short Post-Mortem doc here, if you\u2019re interested in reading about my experience. This was done from no Unity knowledge over three months. It has numerous design flaws, but I'm happy with the level of technical progress.<br/></p>\n<p>This project is very rough - basic testing on Windows has been done, but no live testing of the Mac build have been completed at this time. It will likely not be updated, and only used as reference for future projects with far more time spend on design.</p><p>This was a learning project first, and a proper game a distant second. It should take an average player no more than 10 minutes to beat (barring technical issues), and doesn't have any real depth or complexity to it.</p>\n<p>There is exactly one easter egg, in the standard location for such things.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>A Gamepad is strongly recommended.</p>\n<p>Use Start / ESC to quit at any time.\r\n</p>\n<p>Movement with\u00a0 Left Stick / WASD</p>\n<p>Attack with\u00a0 Right Trigger / Left Click</p>\n<p>Jump with A button / Space</p>\n<p>Dodge with B button / Shift</p>\n<p>Use with X Button / F</p>\n<p>Progress Dialog with A Button / Enter (may need to hit Space to focus controls in Keyboard + Mouse)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e26e96b2fac539b866db213995a409f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["codydmarbach"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
