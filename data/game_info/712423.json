You have received the company's order and need to work in Tamara City. So you start to go to Tamara. One day, you took a ship to cross the sea but reached a forest and it\u2019s already night. You want to go back and wait until tomorrow morning to cross the forest. You know that it is not safe that cross the forest at night. But the pier is closed. You can only go through the forest and find the way to Tamara as soon as possible. In this forest, you only have a torch. Your sight range is only the range that the torch can illuminate. You need to explore this forest, get hints, and find your way out of the forest.\r\n</p>\n\n<strong><em>Controls</em></strong>\n<p>\"W, A, S, D\" to move, Left \"Shift\" to speed up, \"Esc\" to pause the game</p>\n\n<strong><em>DATT 3300 Submission Info</em></strong>\n<p>Lab 02</p>\n<p>Student Name: Yanyun Feng</p>\n<p>Link to the game design document:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L27PZkixFtONKCW5LmRtZpm2DYFrkakr/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111351397755873593847&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true</p>\n\n<strong><em>Notes</em></strong>\n<p>Remember to click the \"?\" button and learn how to play this game first.</p>\n<p>Welcome to all comments about the game good or not or anything that needs to be improved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a2/3a2584774e3edb18c8d5a84c1ea8acf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yanyun Feng"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
