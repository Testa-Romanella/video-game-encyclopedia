It provides two random generators/eliminators and one manual picker.<br/>The first generator is the Straight  Eliminator - any team has the same probability to be selected (it does not matter if team has a seed #1 or #16). <br/>The second generator is the Weighted Eliminator - a team get a weight according it's seed. As an example - team A with a seed #1 plays team B with a seed #16 in the first round. In this case the team A is entered into the picker drum 16 times and team B only once. Similarly, team C seed #5 plays team #12 - thus team C is entered 12 times and opponent team D 5 times.<br/><br/>Both these generators runs in the automatic mode - teams are fed into the picker drum according the draw (First Four, Round1, Round2, Sweet16, Elite8, Final4, Final). Results are kept in the database and prior the next run those results are cleared automatically.<br/><br/>The manual picker feeds teams according the draw but selection of the winner is up to you.<br/><br/>Please note three things:<br/>1. The real draw will be available 24 hours after Selection Sunday (i.e. on March 12, 2017) and will be automatically downloaded when you open the App.<br/>2. This App is not for 2017 draw only. It can be reuse for 68 team draw in the coming years 2018, 2019,... but you must wait for the actual draw (Monday after Selection Sunday).<br/>3. Test team names are included within App, so you can use App immediately. Pictures here are for demo purposes only and real 68 team names will the replaced with real college names after real draw is downloaded.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d52/d5254ff0a50adad3306c9afba71ed104.jpg", "website": "http://www.pdasportstats.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Avruk"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Avruk"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
