Watch out to avoid the pesticide and other more natural enemies. </p>\n<p>If you're playing mobile: Fly to the flower's pistil to pollinate. When you're a ladybug, reach the lice to eat them. The honeybee must deliver pollen to her hive - otherwise she can't continue collecting. Pesticide or wasp contact makes her lose her harvest.<br/></p>\n<p>PC-Gameplay: Navigation via arrow-keys or a-s-w-d. Space bar to pollinate, eat lice or deliver pollen to your hive.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm working on another level - we all love bumblebees, right? If you have ideas or wishes I could implement, please let me know.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits <br/></strong></p>\n<p>Fonts: <br/></p>\n<p>\"CyborgSister\" by jeti published on https://www.dafont.com/de/cyborgsister.font under CC BY 4.0 ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ );<br/></p>\n<p>\"pixelpoiiz\" by poiiz published on https://www.dafont.com/de/pixelpoiiz.font, 100 % free to use;\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Sounds : <br/></p>\n<p>\"Bee Buzzing\" by JonCon_Library published on https://freesound.org/people/JonCon_Library/sounds/481647/ under CC0 ( https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ );</p>\n<p>bfxr by increpare ( https://www.increpare.com/ ); <br/></p>\n<p>\"Birds from Bohemian Switzerland\" by GirlWithSoundRecorder published on https://freesound.org/people/GirlWithSoundRecorder/sounds/489570/ under CC0 ( https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ );</p>\n<p>\"Short loops 14 03 2015\" by B_Lamerich published on https://freesound.org/people/B_Lamerichs/sounds/266938/under CC BY 3.0 ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ );<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics: drawn by Leif + Lycaena</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The author does not bear responsibility for the accuracy, legality or content of the named sites or for that of subsequent links.
