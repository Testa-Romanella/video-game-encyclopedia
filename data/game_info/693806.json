You are able to pull it out from its pedestal by dragging the handle up with your mouse, and when you do, a light shines down, illuminating the surrounding area, and the title appears. There are also a few more interactions. For example, Navi will follow your mouse cursor, and if you click on her a couple times she will say something. Also a small easter egg is that clicking on the small rock in the corner will cause a Korok to appear. You can repeatedly press it to have it move back and forth.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Design Goals</strong></p>\n<p>My main goal of this project was to capture a setting and the theme of the Legend of Zelda series. Originally, I was going to make it pretty similar to my first project, but eventually instead of making the title in the shape of a sword, I decided having the sword form part of the logo, since I thought that would be more interesting as an interaction. It also allowed me to do much more with the surrounding environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I focused on the the environment and the pulling of the Master Sword to represent the main themes of the Zelda franchise. When the sword is pulled, the light illuminates the land and the darkness is dispelled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I also wanted to add some fun interactions, so I added Navi as the cursor and made her talk when pestered enough, and the Korok as an easter egg.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though this is far from my first time coding, this was my first time using any form of java, and also the first time I coded something that needed action from the user other than typing. Thankfully p5.js wasn't too difficult to learn.\u00a0</p><p>My biggest obstacle however was time. I was swamped in the starting weeks of the project, so\u00a0I ended up not being able to implement some of the features I wanted to and overall my poster is very mechanically basic because of it.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T09:51:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c599343e2bc36474be958d0a425a702.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kirbymania"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
