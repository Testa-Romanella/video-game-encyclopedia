It was intended to be a rogue-lite shmup, and in the end I was able to implement a variety of enemies, random spawns, the bones of a mission system, and a ship customization UI. Enemies will occasionally drop loot you can equip in the hangar bay, and there is a mostly functioning boss, though it's second phase may be broken.</p><p>If you're interested in why I cancelled it, I wrote a blog on the subject: http://projectx593.com/blog/2015/11/07/why-im-giving-up-on-my-first-game/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/55756783ddd6ba35398c6bdb86c2ee67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Project X593"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
