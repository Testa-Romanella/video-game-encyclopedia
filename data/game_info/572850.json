Triggering a sequence of levers is their only way out of the dungeon. As the fox, your challenge will be to catch the chickens before they manage to escape. Using your hunter abilities, track down the feathery feasts before dinner flies the coop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game ends when either the fox catches all of the chickens or when the timer hits zero. If at least one chicken has made it out safely without the fox catching them, the chickens win!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Multiplayer Party Game (Max 5 players)<br/><strong>Age Rating</strong>: 7+</p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\n\n<p><strong>Q / E / Left Mouse Click</strong> - Interact Buttons<br/><strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> - Movement<br/><strong>Space</strong> - Jump / Swipe (Fox)<br/><strong>Shift</strong> - Sprint<br/>Mouse movement to rotate camera</p>\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Main menu music: \u201cPitter patter\u201d - Freesfx</p>\r\nTeam:\u00a0\r\n<p>\u201cPixel Peeps\u201d (The Pixel Mill 2020-2021 Bootcamp Dev Team)\r\n</p>\r\nArtists:\r\n<p>Mia McMorrow<br/>Michael Sloan<br/>Nadine Rose McLaughlin<br/>Patrick Sloan<br/>Rachel Gandey-Johnson\r\n</p>\r\nDevelopers:\r\n<p>Bekah Logan<br/>Daniel Gould<br/>Mat Wylie<br/>Niall McCoy<br/>Ricky Taylor\r\n</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks:\r\n<p>Rory Clifford<br/>Juan Gabriel Gomila Salas<br/>Alistair Mountain<br/>Mal Duffin</p>\n<p><em>This game has been created as a 5-week game development project funded by Northern Ireland Screen.</em></p>\n<p>Note: macOS Catalina not currently supported</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/830/83066b2a054faf7bd93f04e6636b159f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Niall McCoy", "Pixel Peeps", "Rachel Gandey-Johnson", "Bekah Logan", "patricksloan", "nadinerosem", "Michael_Sloan", "Daniel Gould", "Rose673", "hollowtaylor", "Mat Wylie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
