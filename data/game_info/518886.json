I have uploaded a windows build for those you want to play the game in all its glory. The music and mechanics still work for WebGL which is the most important part.<br/><br/>AWSD to move.<br/>Space to jump.<br/>Left click to roll.<br/>Right click to grapple.<br/><br/>Hot tip. Rolling and jump helps you cover more distance in a jump.<br/><br/>This a Banjo-Kazooie inspired game. Instead of mixing gaming genres, I mixed music genres much like the Banjo-kazooie games did. The mechanic I am referring to is the music genre seamless transition between differ sections of the world.<br/><br/>I made this solo, <br/>Most of the art assets are from an asset pack I own <br/>[Poly Perfect - Low Poly Ultimate Pack]<br/>For the character controller I used basic controller asset.<br/><br/>All the mechanics were done in the time of the jam.<br/><br/>The Main character is my first 3D model... I usually make 2D games.<br/>Animations were down with Mixamo<br/><br/>The music was made by remixing a Midi song and using instruments that fit the tone of Banjo-Kazooie. 3 renditions of the song. A genre for each area of the map. Yes, next update I will perfect loop the songs. That was out of scope...<br/><br/>Devlog coming soon<br/>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLH06HaHQugD-Z5vhp6_AQA?view_as=subscriber<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:30:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01f0934bdc7e963e3d8e2ad0adf2c26c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Duxxedo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
