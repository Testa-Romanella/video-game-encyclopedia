Harvest resources, grow your hive, and produce a new Queen before the current one dies.<br />\nManage different bee roles in a totally scientifically inaccurate depiction of hive dynamics. Send Foragers out to find pollen and nectar, have Builders research new cell types, and ensure you have enough Beesitters to raise the next generation of bees.<br />\nMake interesting choices that affect the hive. Respond to wasp attacks, deal with outlaw slugs, or help a caterpillar realise a lifelong dream!Hive Time&#39;s original soundtrack is available on Bandcamp.<br />\nDefault controls<br />\nDefault controls are as follows (custom bindings can be set from the Controls menu):<br />\nLeft mouse - Select/interact<br />\nRight mouse - Close radial menu<br />\nMiddle mouse/Cursor keys - Pan view<br />\nScroll wheel/Page Up/Page Down - Zoom view<br />\nHome - Reset pan and zoom<br />\nEnd - Zoom out as far as possible<br />\nSpace - Toggle bee inspection mode<br />\nF5 - Trigger autosave<br />\nF9 - Load latest save<br />\nShift - Hold before performing an action in a radial menu to be able to repeat that menu option with subsequent cell clicks<br />\nAlt+Enter - Toggle fullscreen<br />\nEscape - Close radial menu, close/select negative option in events, pause gamePrint Screen - Save a screenshot<br />\nCheats and debug controls<br />\nMy hope is that you won&#39;t need them, but if you get stuck or want to try specific stuff, there are a few &quot;cheats&quot; in place.

The default value of 25 seems to be appropriate for most systems that the game has been tested on, but lower may be more appropriate for your computer.<br />\nWhen this occurs, the game will typically need to be restarted in order for audio to return to normal.<br />\nAs my hive gets big, the game&#39;s frame rate slowly declines<br />\nDuring development, I made the decision to not put a performance oriented maximum cap on hive or population size, so generally speaking, it will always be possible to make a hive that&#39;s too big for your computer to handle.The game should still be playable at a low frame rate, and spawning a new Queen doesn&#39;t specifically require a large hive, so it&#39;s up to you to play within the constraints of what you&#39;re comfortable with.<br />\nThe game&#39;s minimum requirements are based on running the game with Shadows, Anti-alising, and Depth Of Field settings all disabled, and with the Bee Sound Count audio setting set to zero. These options can have a big impact on performance.<br />\nIf you find that sound is garbled or stuttering, please refer to the &quot;Sound suddenly becomes garbled or stutters&quot; section.<br />\nCurrent known issues:<br />\nKeyboard bindings with modifiers that share primary keys with other bindings (eg: Ctrl+S and S) maybe behave unexpectedly<br />\nDefault pan bindings currently conflict with some radial menu shortcuts<br />\nGameplay tips<br />\nThere&#39;s a lot to keep track of in Hive Time! Part of the fun is in exploring and learning how different systems work. Generally, the impact of your actions takes a little while to be apparent, so observing after experimenting can be important!<br />\nHere are a couple of tips that might point you in the right direction if you&#39;re feeling stuck:<br />\nWhat can I do to stop my bees from dying out?<br />\nBeesitter bees are critical for positive population growth. If your hive&#39;s Beesitters start to decline, there may not be enough of them left to replace the current Beesitter population, which can lead to the hive&#39;s entire population dying out.<br />\nFinding the right balance for your hive&#39;s current needs is important, and that balance needs to be generous enough to not be upset by small fluctuations. Responding quickly to events that impact the hive&#39;s population is important as well. Sometimes you might need to overcompensate in order to get to where you want to be or to prevent a disaster.<br />\nKeep in mind that each role-specific cell increases the population capacity for the relevant bee role. When a role population is over capacity, bees of that role will only live half as long.<br />\nWhy do I keep running out of resources?<br />\nSeveral things influence resource dynamics. Resources are consumed in the production of Wax, Honey, and Jelly, while the accumulation of Nectar and Pollen is dependent on foraging.<br />\nThe chart on the Resources screen (accessible from any storage cell) allows the increase and decline of multiple resources to be viewed at once. If production of a particular resource is consuming too much of another resource, temporarily pausing the relevant production facilities may help.<br />\nForaging requires enough Exit cells for the Worker and Forager populations to leave the hive (as explained in the in-game tutorial, each cell can only support three working bees at once). The Activity screen (accessible from the Upgraded Throne Room) can help highlight when portions of the Forager or Worker populations are idle and unable to gather resources.<br />\nForagers are able to collect for more resources than Workers, so a healthy Forager population with enough Exits and Map Rooms for them to lead full, productive lives can increase Nectar and Pollen collection greatly.<br />\nMaking use of the pollination options in the Foraging screen (accessible from any Map Room)and selecting pollinated foraging zones can also provide a boost to foraged resources.<br />\nHow can I make sure I have enough resources to do stuff without pausing production all the time?<br />\nUpgraded storage cells unlock &quot;reserve&quot; sliders that can be adjusted from the Resources screen (accessible from any storage cell).<br />\nResource reserves put a minimum limit on stock levels before production can happen, keeping the remaining resources spare for you to spend on construction or research!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-07T18:28:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c900bdd9b6fe6346742780a0556154c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Cheeseness", "Mimness"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
