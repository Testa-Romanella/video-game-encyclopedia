It was created for a client who is an audio student and composed the song \"Breathe\".</p><p>Artists statement:</p><p>\"I had a vision, of a man laying down bricks in front of me as I walked a long path. He had no reason to be there, I could have made my own path and struggled through the grass and forests and mountains. Yet he continued to pave the way for me. At points I lost focus, and wandered from the path. Scratching myself on thistles and pushing through vines, I struggled for a while, yet when I emerged from the undergrowth, he was once again in front of me. He took me on my journey, until I could walk no further, and then he picked me up and continued on.\"<br/></p><p>People who worked on this game:</p><p>Stefan Volejnik (Music composition, Concept design)</p><p>Caleb Middlebrook (Programming, Design)</p><p>Harrison Metcalfe (Design, Animation)</p><p>Melinda Asher (Environment design)</p><p>Caleb Barton (Programming)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6935cf05ef52a849742d6eaf25bb9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Melinda Asher", "Caleb Middlebrook", "Harrison Metcalfe", "BreatheGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
