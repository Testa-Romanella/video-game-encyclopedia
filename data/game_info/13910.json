After successfully neutralizing scout ships, securing the crash site and retrieving civilians, XCOM personnel, and alien corpses, it\u2019s clear that all of them are genetically and cybernetically altered, which starts the beginning of the arms race with the invaders.<br />\nDuring the missions X-COM: Enemy Unknown is a turn-based tactical game, while in the downtime players will direct the organization, form units, oversee the research, expand the base of operations and manage resources. Complex combat consists of units taking turns to perform their actions with a top-down view of the battlefield. XCOM soldiers and aliens can take cover during battles, and miss their shots and attacks if anything affects their accuracy. Over the course of the game, players will be able to gain access to new technology while encountering new varied enemy types.</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "2012-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T11:51:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/238/2383a172b4d50a7b44e07980eb7141ea.jpg", "website": "http://www.xcom.com/enemyunknown/", "rating": 4.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 335, "owned": 6026, "beaten": 1042, "toplay": 137, "dropped": 553, "playing": 53}, "playtime": 13, "achievements_count": 220, "ratings_count": 1545, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 1553, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "macOS"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "2K", "Firaxis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["2K Games", "Feral Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
