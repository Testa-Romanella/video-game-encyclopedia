From very fast but low health wasps, to extremely high health crabs that slowly crawl towards you, there is no shortage of enemy variety. As the game progresses, you will discover new and more formidable enemies that will truly put your battle skills to the test.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Strike down waves and waves of blood-splattering enemies with all of your orbital weapons. Each wave is procedurally generated, so you will never face the same wave twice! The difficulty of each wave scales to the wave number you are on, so you will feel the difficulty rise each new wave. As the waves progress, new enemies will show their faces. New enemies, more enemies, bigger enemies, how long will you last?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T03:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14d/14d17858ec80fc97faba8153416598d4.jpg", "website": "https://www.vultiveentertainment.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Robichaux", "CheezeGravy"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vultive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
