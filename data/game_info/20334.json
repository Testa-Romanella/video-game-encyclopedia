Not because you are being killed by things you could not possibly know - you perfectly know what's what but you still can't pull off the moves. In some platformers you spend 10 minutes on a level that can be passed in under 15 seconds. <br/>\r\nYou might look at SLIDE's  footage and think that it's an easy game. But you would be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSLIDE is a hardcore 2d platformer where you run, jump and (often) die. No enemies, no blowing stuff up.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat makes this game stand out - for better or worse - is a system of contextual jumps which allows to perform dozens of jumps simply by combining direction keys with the \"jump\". You can even jump down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis feature not only makes for a unique paltforming experience but also adds a puzzle element where you need to figure out what jumps are available to you and which ones to perform in certain situations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d7697ba0da1efe00b10ed438b100c81.jpg", "website": "http://slideplatformer.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["APAS games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["APAS games"], "esrb_rating": null}
