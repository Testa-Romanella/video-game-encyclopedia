Leaving a planet without the pod will send you back to the same world.</p><p>After completing the game you will restart with gravity reversed. Finishing the game again will restart you facing invisible worlds. Expect a combination of those two after defeating the game again. After that? You'll be a legend. Send me a screenshot of your accomplishment!</p><p>You can use the editors to create your own worlds! Feel free to send worlds to me, so I can offer them to everyone from the website for download.</p><p>Use the readme file in the archive for instructions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adf/adf31c9c3ce1ff53cae31d56675d47a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wiebow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
