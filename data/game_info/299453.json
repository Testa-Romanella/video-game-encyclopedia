{"id": 299453, "slug": "rohto", "name": "Rohto", "name_original": "Rohto", "description": "<p>Rohto is a hectic cooking game where you manage a potion shop in the middle of dark forest and make potions for fellow shaman and witch customers.</p>\n<p>You sell and create as many potions as possible before the day runs out. You control the shaman with WASD + E keys and mouse. The game doesn't support controllers.</p>\n<p>When a customer comes to your shop, ask their order, pick up the raw ingredients and use the mix table to refine them to fine ingredients. Put the fine ingredients into a cauldron, then bottle the mixture to a proper bottle, enchant the potion if needed and finally sell it to a waiting customer.</p>\n<p>To excel at the game you must learn to manage your time and inventory and pay attention to multiple parts in progress, while moving around the shop and playing minigames.</p>\n<p>Fail to sell enough and your career as a shopkeep ends there. Play as long as you can manage creating complex potions for more and more demanding customers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2f/e2fb09f4f9665158fa786897004d9d72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bind"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
