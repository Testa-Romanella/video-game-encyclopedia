I felt like making a more abstract horror game that had low-res graphics, an AI that has a set path instead of walking around aimlessly and some new hiding mechanics I'm testing out in this game.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my short experimental\u00a0horror game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-03T10:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc7/dc74a6ba9d1d4ef1506c837294026bd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
