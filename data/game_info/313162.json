You can find the source code on my github. <br/></p><p>Space Struggle is a space management game.\r\nYou are the captain of a rebel ship that fights the Dog Catcher Association (DCA) to protect the dog population of your solar system.</p>\n<p>Today you attacked a DCA outpost and freed seven cute puppies. Several DCA ships are hunting you as a result. They hacked your bank account and you are not able to access your money. You must reach your Home planet. They can defend you from the DCA.</p>\n<p>Your fuel is limited and you will have to trade parts of your ship for fuel to reach Home. Selling parts will make you slower and weaker. Selling too much of the wrong parts can mean death. Your ship has four types of parts: Scanning, Speed, Damage, and Defense parts.\r\nCheck the ingame help screen for more explanations.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s hope you can make it Home.\r\nFOR THE DOGGOS!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d85/d855a9385f49cbe1455cddd0c06874d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yellow Hat Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
