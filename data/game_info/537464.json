In order to escape Harmony's nightmares, the player tries to gain as much height as possible by jumping between fixed platforms, while at the same time having to create a path between these platforms by cleverly placing falling elements. This coordinative feat is aimed at fans of challenging games of skill and dark worlds that tell their very own story.</p>\n<p>Dream of Harmony is a student project that was developed with the Unity Engine at the Games Academy Berlin within six weeks by a six-persons team called <strong>BRUNCHTIME STUDIO</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is very welcome! :)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>SPECS</strong></p>\r\nGenre:Arcade Platformer<br/>Platforms:PC (Windows), Smartphones (Android)\r\nPlayer count:<br/>1\u00a0 (Singleplayer)Target group:<br/>Fans of complex platformer gamesSetting:Gloomy nightmare of a young coma patientArtstyle:Grayscale Comic<br/>Camera view:<br/>Side view\r\nControls:Keyboard, Gamepad, TouchscreenEngine:Unity\r\n\r\n\n<p><strong>TEAM MEMBERS</strong><br/></p>\r\nManuel Michel<br/>Game Designer, Project Manager, Sound DesignerCenk Melzer<br/>Lead Programmer<br/>Florian Weiss<br/>ProgrammerHannah Goral<br/>Artist (Concept, Environment, UI)<br/>Isabel Verheyen<br/>Artist (Character, Animation, Props)<br/>Ren\u00e9 Rittmann<br/>Artist (Creature, Animation)<br/>\n\n<p><strong>ANDROID APP</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game was developed with a focus on Windows PCs, but is also playable on Android Phones.
