You may come across some very hostile plants! You are free to go in any direction and progress by leveling up and collecting special items. If you brought all the plants to Grandma and defeated all 3 Bosses you pretty much completed the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I did fixes afte</strong><strong>r the jam ended, these had a big negative effect and took less than 10 minutes to solve (I just didn't notice before submitting). Please judge for yourself if these fixes are reasonable or too much.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The fixes were:</p>\r\n-  Fixed that music only played the first track once, and the second track never :(<br/>- Fixed random dying because\u00a0one enemy was\u00a0invisible \u00a0(<em>missing texture)</em><br/>- Fixed stupid collision preventing movement in the forest\u00a0stage, keeping a good share of the content pretty much inaccessible. Super dumb.\r\n<br/>- Fixed that the wrong button would be shown in the tutorial (said press A when it's actually B)\r\n<p>The download below is the Jam version with it's unfixed flaws, if you want to rate\u00a0only by that :)\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/>3 people were\u00a0invovled in making this game:</strong></p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0Kaoni\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Killed By Kindness\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Everything else:\u00a0Ca\u00df\u00a0(Including the bad Art)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T14:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f8ee8fb922cb4b858d47e3b2c6995b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["GapaGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
