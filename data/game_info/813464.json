You don't need to know the rules of chess to play this. I hope it's entertaining--it's based on a classic puzzle but hopefully has narrative.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a relatively well-known endgame puzzle I tried to add a story to. The parser is ... experimental, so if something is broken, I want to know! You can take a transcript with TRANSCRIPT or report issues at https://github.com/andrewschultz/you-wont-get-her-back.<br/></p>\n<p>Update 1: (7/1 5 AM Central) Wade Clarke (http://wadeclarke.com, http://wade-clarke.itch.io) found some bugs very quickly. They involved row/column display and misleading hints and also that \"w\" had been superseded by \"w [x]\", the column width adjusting feature added on the final day. These were trivial fixes, and I feel silly I missed them, but they're in now. There was also a problem with double-printing the starting board if you got two achievements at once.</p><p>Update 2: Wade and Olaf Nowacki (https://fumbaloaoa.itch.io/) followed up with even more useful tweaks! They include row labeling and some debug code being removed and a case where text was printed twice.</p><p>There will be more. Someone actually reported bugs at the github site, and I'll want to fix them ASAP!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:36:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andrew Schultz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
