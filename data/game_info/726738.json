{"id": 726738, "slug": "bitbot-jools64", "name": "Bitbot (Jools64)", "name_original": "Bitbot (Jools64)", "description": "<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Left Arrow</strong>: Run left<br/><strong>Right Arrow</strong>: Run right<br/><strong>Up Arrow</strong>: Jump<br/><strong>R</strong>: Restart current level</p>\n<p><strong>Info:<br/></strong>This game was written in C for CJam which had the theme \"bitwise\". It is a puzzle platformer where you use various blocks to apply bitwise operations to Bitbot. If its light strip matches the door, you are allowed to go through to the next level.</p>\n<p>I use the following libraries:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>stb_image</li><li>microui\u00a0(Only\u00a0for internal\u00a0level\u00a0editor\u00a0and\u00a0asset\u00a0manager)</li><li>SDL2</li></ul>\n<p>Other than those libraries, I started entirely from scratch. I wanted to write an engine that would be re-usable for other Jams and also contain a level editor. I was a bit over ambitious for the amount of free time I have and ended up making something way smaller than I'd hoped. I didn't even have time to throw in\u00a0some basic sound. :( I might come back and flesh out the idea a little more at some point because I think it has some potential. The levels that I scraped together in a couple of hours don't really do the concept justice.</p>\n<p>The source is terrible so I'd advise against reading it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T07:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d741cb27489943ca9cb932b5bb5324.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Jools64"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
