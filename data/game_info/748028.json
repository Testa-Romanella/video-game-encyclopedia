{"id": 748028, "slug": "panel-hack", "name": "Panel Hack", "name_original": "Panel Hack", "description": "<p>(Project is still in development)</p>\n<p>Panel Hack is a puzzle game based on the Super Famicom game \"Panel de Pon\" (Localized as Tetris Attack or Puzzle League). \u00a0Slide tiles horizontally  to create matches and combos, and to build up your HACK meter. When the meter is full you can unleash a Panel Hack! This will randomize all the tiles on the currently selected row, potentially leading to more opportunities to gain points. Alternatively, you can wait for the meter to fill up a second time to unleash a more powerful version, which will randomize the row below as well.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys / D-Pad - Move cursor</p>\n<p>Z / \u00a0Bottom face button - Swap panels</p>\n<p>X / Right face button - Panel Hack (when meter is full)</p>\n<p>F / L1/R1 - Move board upward</p>\n<p>ESC / Start / + / Options - Pause game<br/></p>\n\n<p>As the game is still in development, many planned features have yet to be implemented. Such features include:</p>\n<ul><li>Rebindable Controls</li><li>Local &amp; Online Versus Modes</li><li>A Singleplayer Campaign</li><li>Alternative Hack Types</li><li>Alternative Background &amp; Palette Options</li></ul>\n<p>Once the game has enough content to warrant it, you will need to pay for the full version. I'll likely keep a version as small as this one free as a demo though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54b/54ba31499b5848c95c19b6f5fa6cc9dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ZetCipher"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
