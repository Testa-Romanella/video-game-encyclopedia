Faced with the threat of a global extinction, you opt for a last resort expedition to your last hope, a device which was expected to save the world and yet might have doomed it. Along with your best friends, a pack of dogs you were raised with, you begin your ride to the Morning Star.</p>\n\n<p>Plan your exploration carefully as you roam the world, scavenge for resources to feed yourself and your dogs, drive through both hostile snowstorms and beautiful sunsets as you close the distance between you and salvation. Once your day of exploring is over, find a spot to settle camp for the night and use this relative security to feed and pet your canine companions, then sleep and live another day as a pilgrim to the Morning Star.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Explore an ice-cold world where magic and death are intertwined\r\n</li><li>Meet 4 dogs with their own perks\r\n</li><li>Immersive and realistic sled driving\r\n</li><li>Discover the end of a world through audio logs as you drive\r\n</li><li>Leave your sled to gather key resources\r\n</li><li>Be prepared to face sacrifices\r\n</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><em>You need a controller to play the game.</em> <br/></p>\n<p>Drive the sled by pressing your left and right triggers according to how much you want to lean towards one or the other.
