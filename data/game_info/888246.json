This was possible by taking on jobs from bidders on the dark net.</p>\n<p>With your skills as a thief and your brother\u2019s skills as a hacker, the jobs were risky but proving a reliable source of funds for your ill Nanna\u2019s treatment.\u00a0The jobs you have completed have caught the attention of \u201cTh\u00a3 Corpor@tion\u201d.

Not only is it a school day, but your brother has been unfairly sent to the principal\u2019s office. His only crime was defending himself\u00a0 against a common school bully.\r\n</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s not bad enough, you have also been captured by a gang at The Docks. You were trying to secure a boat, so you could travel to The Wastelands to fix their teleporter and help their people.\r\n</p>\n<p>We pick up the story with you locked in a cell by this mysterious gang.
