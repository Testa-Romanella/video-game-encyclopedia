I'm still making the 2nd chapter so don't stay tuned for that because its gonna be worse like this one. There are just 6 levels currently. (Like I'm ever going to update this game, xD)</p>\n<p>Bug: If the character is stuck like on the sky or something just reload the page to counter this bug. I can't fix it because I don't know. Maybe it's because the y levels but it doesn't make sense.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T07:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03c/03c1d0c62eab4d91fd4d1db90b1568b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GTI1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
