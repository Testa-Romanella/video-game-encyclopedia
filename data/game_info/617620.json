The odds seem against you but luckily your ship is equipped with\u00a0<strong>Nanotechnology!</strong> With it, you can augment your ship with the bodies of the Space Nanites. All are good for armor.\u00a0 A few types can even help\u00a0fire back!

How about some tips!<br/></p>\n<ul><li>The longer a Space Nanite is alive, the faster they move</li><li>The more Space Nanites that are attached to the\u00a0<strong>Hopper</strong>, the more enemies will come. (this rate does not go back down so figure out that threshold!)</li><li>The greenish enemies (Octos and Drones) will shoot extra lasers when attached to the\u00a0<strong>Hopper</strong></li><li>The more Space Nanites attached to the\u00a0<strong>Hopper,\u00a0</strong>the slower they will be</li><li>Strategically attach Space Nanites in different configurations to maximize your chances.</li><li>Be sure to attach a layer of Space Nanites all around your ship to prevent a lucky Space Nanite from slipping in</li><li>Shooting a Space Nanite a second time will destroy it, which prevents you from attaching it to the\u00a0<strong>Hopper</strong>. Be careful when arranging your shooting Space Nanites.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:21:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10c6b41e58edf88c5587447ab18c55c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["smileywiley"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
