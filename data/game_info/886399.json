The prompt for the game jam was \"Pick Your Poison.\"</p><p>In this game, you take control of a witch brewing potions for monstrous customers. Each order, however, has two orders on it -- one an ordinary potion that is perfectly safe to drink, and the other a poison that will kill the customer immediately. You can kill a customer to obtain a bag of fertilizer that will instantly grow any plants that happen to be on cooldown, but be wary of raising your suspicion too high. Fill orders and earn 100 gold to win. Your gold is listed in the top right corner above the suspicion meter.</p><p>A green cauldron is brewing and a pink cauldron is finished, but you can always add more ingredients to a finished brew. Click on a finished brew to bottle it into a potion. You can place any items on tables, or throw them in a trash can to delete them.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys to Move</li><li>LMB to Interact and Move</li><li>Escape to Pause/Unpause</li><li>M to Toggle Music</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Fatimeh Bashir -- UI Artist</li><li>Kem Echezona -- Sound Designer</li><li>Oscar Goes -- Artist</li><li>Scott Krabbenhoft -- Lead Programmer and Level Designer</li><li>Sakina Mehdi -- Artist</li><li>Kavi Namburi -- Programmer</li></ul>\n<p>Third-Party Assets Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Sounds from UTD Sound Ideas Library</li><li>Background Music by Cymatics.fm\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T04:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c3511cdb302106f503816863735e42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skinnyK"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
