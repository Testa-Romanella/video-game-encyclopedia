The strain \n      on the world's magical energy is literally tearing the Land apart. The \n      Land's fate lies in your hands. You must fight hard and earn the respect \n      of all the races of the Land, and together you must fight to keep the \n      Land alive. Travel the Land earning respect points by battling small \n      armies that you'll find along your journey, and eventually work your way \n      up to all out war. The more respect points you gain, the more inclined \n      warriors will be to join your army.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0d/b0d2938dc6a3464262eb7469c4642f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment US"], "esrb_rating": null}
