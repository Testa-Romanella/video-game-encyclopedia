The theme was 'running out of space', so I went a bit outside the box... Or should I say, window! Hopscotch the rabbit has developed her most amazing invention ever, the Growatron! Now she'll be able to grow her snacks as big as she wants in the blink of an eye! That is, unless the machine malfunctions and starts to shrink the world around her! It's up to Hopscotch to find the tools she needs to fix the Growatron, before her world becomes a bit too snug.<br/></p>\n<p>Quantum Hop was made solely by myself in 3 days, so it's really more of a demonstration/prototype. I've thought of going back and adding more levels and stuff, but for now it's as is.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f1/7f1c9daedec8996386d5834f3ac70302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ShazySoft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
