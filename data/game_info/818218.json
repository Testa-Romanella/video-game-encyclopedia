A lot of the assets used are from my main project, Grey Heritage: Faded Vision. The art and music are used from there to save time. The writing was something I came up with a while ago. The surprisingly part is that it was one of my first script for Grey Heritage until it got scrapped for my current plot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan to come back to this game in the future when I can polish this story so it can be ready for a commercial release. Until then, here is a fun and quick teaser on what I will work on in the future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T08:04:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed1/ed108e0c0a3f4ba71f4e8cf0e7c697cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BTrain"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
