The thing is, they shoot very well and they do a lot of damage, so how can you ?! By scrolling your mouse wheel down, you can slow down time and up you can speed up time. When time is slowed down, your energy goes down and when time is sped up, it goes up. You have to balance the two to keep your energy while defeating rooms of enemies by dodging bullets and aiming well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, for some levels you will have some charges of portals or mind control that will help you clear the level. Mind control lets you control an enemy and use it to attack other enemies without risking your own health. Portals let you travel far away without risking being hit on the way and saving time.</p>\n<p>Each level has an online leaderboard for time and score. Try to beat other players' time and scores and reach the top of leaderboards !\u00a0The leaderboards use Epic Online Services so you will have to login with an epic games account.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a41/a4148ab34c0a0ac477c9f6270a299f0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxMakesGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
