{"id": 138784, "slug": "monster-flip-itch", "name": "Monster Flip (itch)", "name_original": "Monster Flip (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>Description</strong><br/>A simple game about flipping cards to reveal matching monsters. 12 cards are arranged on a table, with 6 pairs. Find the ones that match, and you unlock them in your monster manual. The game saves your monsters, so exiting the game will not undo your progress.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>But why though?</strong><br/>This is the result of a challenge I set myself while on vacation this summer.\u00a0I wanted to make a game in a week, based on a simple mechanic. I knew I wanted to work with cards, so a match-two style game seemed an interesting challenge\u00a0for a fledgling programmer.</p>\n<p>I also wanted a collection system where one could admire their achievements so far, and a save system that allowed progress to be kept between sessions.\u00a0Not a challenging <em>game</em>, but a very valuable <em>programming experience</em>!</p>\n<p><strong>The art and sounds are too good to be made by you!</strong><br/>Yup.
