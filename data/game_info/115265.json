It's the first game I released, and my first jam entry.</p><p>Controls:</p><p> WASD or arrow keys to move,mouse click to kill enemies.</p><p>E to skip the dialog.</p><p> Unfortunately, I couldn't complete the game as I wanted and cut a lot of the gameplay, couldn't implement the animations and the other 2 levels which will complete the story. But I wanted to release the game because finally I could finally finish a jam with a playable(sort of) game. Thank you for your time for playing it. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e7bad765ca8490460643010a52c2377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreeDome Studio - Sinan Acar"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
