Would we be able to understand each other? Would they even be interested in communicating with us? Well, I think we don\u2019t even have to leave our planet to get some answers to these questions. In the end, we often don\u2019t even understand each other as a people. Join us in our game Petri and let\u2019s try to find some answers ourselves! Play as a small living organism in a Petri dish and meet with another UNKNOWN organism. Try to communicate! Try to understand each other! See if you can learn to cooperate. And most of all - have fun!</p>\n<p>How to play:\r\n</p>\n<p>Host/Join a game. Share the code with a friend (or post in some global chat and meet some new potential friends ;)). Move around and try communicating just by moving and observing each other! Think of goals you want to make the other \u201cbacteria\u201d do. Will they follow your instructions? Or will you fail to \u201cconnect\u201d?\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T06:17:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cd9a2301fa0c80937479fda3df5d890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ilirion", "Deathress", "Mates1912"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
