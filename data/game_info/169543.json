You play as a farming robot, DAE, who has set out to create his own farm on his very own asteroid. You are given 2 quite alien-looking plants to begin with, but maybe you'll discover more.\u00a0<br/>The asteroid you're making your farm on is an actual spherical world that you are free to explore. It is full of exploration opportunities, as well as different places that you can make your own with your plants. However, the asteroid is also prone to a lot of solarstorms, which might kill your plants if they are not protected. BUT, if your plant does survive, it goes through quite the change. Take the risk to find out!</p>\n<p><strong>Who are the developers<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kaya Karlsen: Project leader and lead programmer</li><li>Paul Henrik Wilhelmsen: Programmer<br/>https://bitbucket.org/Paul_Henrik/<br/>https://paulhenrikwilhelmsen.wordpress.com/</li><li>Kristian Lothe: Project manager, animator and rigger\u00a0<br/>https://www.artstation.com/krissen</li><li>Vilde Katrine Skardal: Concept art, 3D assets, main level design\u00a0and a little rigging and animation<br/>https://www.artstation.com/vildes</li><li>Vetle Rossland: Concept art, 2D and 3D assets and rigger</li></ul>\n<p>We are actually a group of 5 students who just graduated from Inland University in Norway. Two of us got a Bachelors degree in Game Technology and Simulation, and the other three of us got a Bachelor in Animation and Digital Art.\u00a0LunarPlant is our bachelor project that we have been working on for about 9 months, where the first four months were pre-production and the last five were actual production and development.\u00a0<br/>Apart from the five of us, we've also gotten a great deal of help from outsourcing some art, music and sound effects. These people are:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Tommy Iberg: Music<br/>https://soundcloud.com/tommy-iberg/sets/lunarplant-ost</li><li>Jonas Medhus: Concept art</li><li>Haakon Tover\u00f8d Davidsen: Sound effects</li><li>Anders Kile Gr\u00f8nnings\u00e6ter: Sound effects<br/>https://www.minibossaudio.com/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Where do we go from here?<br/></strong>Since we're done with our Bachelors degree now, we are scattering across Norway. Therefore, we cannot maintain the development of LunarPlant the way we have for the past 5 months. However, some of us are interested in working on it further, and will keep the game as a hobby project. We can therefore not guarantee a steady stream of updates and patches, but we might add some stuff here and there, and update the files on this site. We are very aware that the game has many bugs, some gamebreaking and others just annoying, and we would very much like to fix these.<br/>We do sincerely hope that you find our game interesting and fun. Feel free to leave us any feedback, be that good or bad, or any questions that you might have\u00a0in the comments on this page. It is much appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c0/5c0dfc8d7cc3d55f5308c2fa78bfd41e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LunarPlant"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
