Only each player's god exists. There are some basic rules about how a god \"makes a declaration,\" which determines an \"element of reality.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>Maybe a god declares, \"Light exists.\" The GM and the player discuss what exactly is meant by this declaration to determine whether this counts as \"chemistry (small scale physics),\" \"human scale physics,\" or \"astronomy (large scale physics).\"\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Then the player rolls some six sided dice based on their god's statistics. Each 3, 4, 5, or 6, is a success. The player goes to a shared document called \"The Elements of Reality,\" and writes down \"Light exists,\" as well as recording the number of successes that player rolled for that declaration.\r\n</p>\n<p>Session 1 of Eroding the Outside is a lot like the first chapter of Genesis from the Bible.<br/><br/>You can get this book print on demand from Amazon.</p>\n<p>Eroding The Outside: A TTRPG of Gods https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WPZSMLY/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_Y8X1S7KHCGA89DG3PZMT<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T17:33:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88d/88da6128ad9547a48b701b8d6994f8f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alley Wurds"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
