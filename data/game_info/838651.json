Dodge asteroids, space debris and spaceships and do your best to survive! Keep grabbing energy cells or the jetpack will run out of juice! But be careful, the cells are not compatible with the ones of the other types.\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- How to Play -\r\n<br/>- Move with <strong>WASD</strong>\n<br/>- <strong>Spacebar </strong>for faster movement (consumes more energy)\r\n<br/>-<strong> B</strong> to use\u00a0 a temporary shield.\r\n<br/>- <strong>N</strong> to fire a blaster laser projectile.</p>\n<p>- The astronaut's jetpack needs energy to keep flying, so be on the lookout for the energy cells floating in space. If you get more of the same color, your maximum capacity will increase and will be rewarded for it. If you get a cell with a different color than the last one you had, you'll lose all the capacity gained and go back to the starting energy.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Always look for power ups scaterred around! You can find a Medkit to recover one health point, a temporary shield to become invincible or a blaster to destroy any obstacle in front of you. They glow so you will recognise them! (The energy cells glow as well)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Post your highest score on the comments!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:38:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8cd18486086307cbff456adbbe09377.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Everlong Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
