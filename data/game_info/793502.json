Over the summer of 2020, it was further developped for public use as a passion project.</p>\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This simulation is far from perfect.\u00a0It ignores collisions and is not built to real-world scale. Moreover, the volume of bodies is not considered. Instead, they are treated as single-point masses to simplify calculations.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:40:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85e/85e68648ced86af6da587d83a75b65aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atienn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
