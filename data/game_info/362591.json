{"id": 362591, "slug": "forbidden-siren-2", "name": "Siren 2", "name_original": "Siren 2", "description": "<p>Forbidden Siren 2 is a haunting tale set on the island of Yamijima. The story starts as a group of characters are washed up on the island&#39;s shore after their boat is caught in a violent storm. Unbeknown to them, 29 years earlier all the inhabitants of the island mysteriously disappeared in a black-out. Up until now the events of that ill-fated night remain unsolved. But as the chilling sound of a warning siren rings out over the island, the castaways are faced with the awakening of the Shibito (living dead) and the Yamibito (people of the dark). To survive the island, players need to use light to their advantage. Both the Yamibito and Shibito are sensitive to light - but in opposing ways. To wipe out the Yamibito players need to turn lights on but, to escape the Shibito players need to eliminate light, smashing street lamps, or hiding in the darkness. Players can also use a variety of weapons to dispose of their enemies as well as running them down by using abandoned vehicles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-21T16:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/289/28941a660257f82bdb1f48057b1293cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 8, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["SCE Japan Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["SCEE"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
