The museum director calls the hero and tells him that his main goal is not to protect the museum from thefts at all, but to keep an eye on the statue! The director declares that every night the statue of Stalin tries to leave the museum, and that is exactly what you must not allow. You have cameras, a radio, a torch and a table to hide under.<br/>You must use the tools given to you correctly to complete your task and prevent your own death.<br/>Keep track of Stalin's movements and don't forget to look around.<br/><br/>Stalin is a strong opponent who will not just try to escape, but will gradually start to get stronger. <br/>Getting fired because of his escape is far from the worst thing that could happen.<br/><br/>The game will encounter three opponents, each with their own mechanics, beautifully atmospheric graphics and plenty of detail.<br/>There are 5 nights in this game, each more difficult than the last, as well as a hardcore night which is given on full playthrough. <br/>There are no inbuilt purchases, skins or anything else in the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-08T03:17:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/43366ba9bdd55e366e0ac6461c687be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FreezyCat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["FreezyCat"], "esrb_rating": null}
