Among this time, there is hope. You take command of Crow, a young man from the badlands of Zernakreas Minor to be chosen for a great destiny by the Goddess. You are the only hope for all of Gaia...</p>\n<p>I came up with this idea for a JRPG back in '99 called Knight Spirit, however I couldn't develop the game with the right tools. Now it has been re-imagined in this prequel demo to see how the public receives this project's story. This is my very first video game so be gentle please.\u00a0 I made this using all of the free data that comes from RPGMaker VX Ace Lite, this demo (or continued version of this game particular title if liked) is not for re-sale or distribution. All images and graphics used were pre-installed with the RPGMaker VX Ace Lite and I in no way claim any legal right over the graphic content material or engine. The story content and character names on the other hand is the brain child of Team Manga Studio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T08:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509b58609faa0058803ffe4551126524.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Manga Studio Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
