Last Team/Player standing wins!</p>\n<p>Players starts off with a single cannon, but as they destroy asteroids they can attach additional cannons and missile launchers.\u00a0 There are also health packs, and a pick-up that converts regular missiles into homing missiles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls - Xbox Controllers ONLY:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The games controls have been designed for, and only tested with, Xbox Controllers.</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong> Left Thumbstick<em> (up/down = forward/back; left/right = rotates)</em></li><li><strong>Shields: </strong>Right Thumbstick <em>(shields are directional)</em></li><li><strong>Cannons:</strong> Right Trigger</li><li><strong>Missiles</strong>:\u00a0Left Trigger</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Dude Blasters, obviously a silly name, was made for an annual LAN party event with friends that we had dubbed \"Dude Gaming\u00a0Weekend\" - so I thought the name \"Dude Blasters\" was fitting title.</p>\n<p>This was my first real Multiplayer Game, and after all was said and done I think I'm most proud of Player Select screen. I like that you're able to select your ship, and then organize yourself into any team structure (2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, 1v5, etc.)<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0made a WebGL built, but the Xbox Controller layout didn't work well (i.e. the Right Trigger became assigned to the Start Button).\u00a0\u00a0If there ends up being some interest, or if I find some time, I might try and troubleshoot that and upload a WebGL version.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>I\u00a0imagine there's some bugs that I am not aware of, and if you find any please feel free to add them to the comments below.\u00a0 One 'bug' I know of is that players sometimes spawn into the asteroids, but you can just shoot your way out :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:26:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/817/817ff9ba4592d6ff0479c3a60f7c03f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Quoclon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
