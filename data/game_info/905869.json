Updated weekly.\r\n</p>\n<p>CULT will be a top-down resource management strategy game, where you will use supernatural powers to influence the inhabitants of a small medieval town to form a glorious cult in your name. A procedurally generated town will form a careful balance of social networks and productivity, where each member of the community pulls their weight and has a distinct personality for you to take advantage of.</p>\n<p>So far, the game doesn't have too much going - but already, the randomly generated inhabitants of your little town will be moving about, spending most of their day working their farms, chopping wood, or simply chatting to their neighbors!</p><p>If you do take the time to download and play this, please feel free to comment any thoughts you might have on the game so far - I will be trying to regularly update this post with conceptual work or actual updates to the game! I'm hoping that over time, this can serve as a proof of concept for the game of CULT to take off!
