HTML version\u00a0has been updated as well. (\"Funfair - Windows.zip\" is still the original version uploaded before\u00a0the deadline.)</p>\n\r\n(F)unfair\r\n<p>This game is an entry for the Community Game Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>In (F)unfair you are the manager of a funfair. You design the layout by\u00a0placing paths and building stands with games for your customers. To earn more money you have the option of rigging\u00a0your games. However, customers won't be happy being scammed and lied to. If there happens to be an unsatisfied customer expressing their\u00a0anger, you have to \"take care\" of the problem. Don't let the satisfaction level of your customers stay too low, or less\u00a0visitors will come to your funfair.</p>\n\n\r\nTheme implementation:\r\n<p>The theme of this game jam was \"The game is a liar\". We usually don't like to choose the most obvious interpretation of a jam theme, which in this case would be\u00a0the video game itself lying to the player. Hence we started to think about\u00a0where\u00a0real-life games are \"lying\" to their players and soon rigged funfair games came to our minds. We wanted to make a video game that builds around this aspect, and the result is a mini-tycoon where you have to scam NPCs with rigged funfair games.</p>\n\r\nGameplay / Controls:\r\n<p>Gameplay instructions and controls are explained in-game.</p>\n\r\nTechnical details:\r\n<ul><li>The game was made in Unity</li><li>All used graphics and sounds have been made by ourselves (except the font - see below).</li><li>Used font:\u00a0https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P\u00a0- (Open Font License)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7992e9c9539105dbaa1a7178f9a5139c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Andreas Roschal", "woergbi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
