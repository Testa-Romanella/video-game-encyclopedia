Unfortunately for them, they live in a painfully boring small town in the Pacific Northwest. The only place that has any chance of being remotely creepy is the middle school that was decommissioned a few years ago. Becca convinces Tara to join her and some others she knows from the internet to spend the night there.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>my own paper walls</em> is a horror game with some dark themes and profanity. While it doesn't contain any scenes of outright depravity, mature players of thirteen and up are best suited. There are no pictures, only text descriptions. Headphones and a dark room are recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b34/b343246b730cf666ea764496596e0eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fia glas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
