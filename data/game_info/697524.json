Keeping you <br/>immersed, the puzzles logically fit with the situation, and don\u2019t force a mini game where <br/>it would not belong.<h3>Story</h3>You have interfered with the plans of a rival who has left you to die on a plane, along with some expendable cargo. The pilots are gone, and the plane is flying  itself. How long the plane will last in the air, is a guess. Best to get out, as quickly as possible.<h3>Key Features</h3>Hint system and menu controls are fit into the location, so you never have to exit, to make changes. <br/>Hints are based on progress, so you\u2019ll never get a hint that is not relevant. <br/>The game is part non linear, so you can chose how you progress. If one puzzle is giving you a  <br/>problem, spend time on another for a while.<br/><br/><br/>It\u2019s VR, designed for full room-scale/standing tracking with motion controllers.
