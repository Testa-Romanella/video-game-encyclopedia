Sounds crazy enough? Read on!</p>\n<p>And if all those different game genres were not enough we are also going to do something brave with the setting. You start with a primitive tribe making their first village in the <strong>Stone Age</strong> but through research and development you can reach more advanced ages like <strong>Classical Age</strong>, <strong>Renaissance</strong>, <strong>Industrialization</strong> and finally <strong>Space Age </strong>(there are 9 different ages planned)!\u00a0 A picture of primitive tribesmen throwing stones at flying saucers would be quite possible. You are not obligated to do it though, if you want to play a nomadic horde that beats others by outnumbering - it is a viable choice too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:10:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ca/5ca19aba2ff1450786f250e502527d9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Qumaron"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
