You're in a race against dwindling resources, and systems break down rapidly. Your crew are your only hope.</p>\n<p>There's a catch: the crew members are independent beings. You can't control them. They're also fickle, needy, and (at times) incompetent. Still, you have to rely on them.</p>\r\nTake Fate into\u00a0Your (Digital) Hands\r\n<p>Design your own ship. Customize everything.</p>\n<p>Control the ship's systems. Set alarms to get the crew's attention. Respond to emergencies.</p>\n<p>Die, alone and drifting, in the dark.</p>\r\nBrutal Resource Management\r\n<p>Deep mechanics, simple controls, responsive difficulty, short sessions, and randomized gameplay elements lead to a tight, challenging experience.</p>\n<p>A single run takes less than half an hour, but success takes hours of mastery.</p>\r\nAn Uncaring World\r\n<p><em>Destination Ares</em> is about losing power over time rather than gaining it. It's about the internal struggle instead of the external.\u00a0There are no aliens or guns; just nonchalant blobs of water named Charlie.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dev &amp;&amp; Design Blog: http://blog.patrick-scott.com</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\r\n\tTwitter: \r\n\t</em><em>@_stralor</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nMusic composed by R Kim Shultz.
