After fumbling with the GB studio engine\u00a0for a while (Black Tape), i wondered if it's possible to make a decent port of one of my old games \"YO! JOE!\" (Amiga, PC) to the GAME BOY.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>My goal is to get a game that could have been the game boy port at the time of its original release. At least get close to something like this. I know, this goal is quite ambitious for a free-time project.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>With the 2.0 version, it should at least be possible to make the bonus levels between the main stages. But there will still be plenty to cut due to the limitations of the game boy and my bad programming skills (in my mind I skipped the option for a two-player option already, which was a hallmark of the game). I'll try my best. On the other hand, I'm really excited about how far i can go.<br/></p>\n<p>The biggest challenge will be porting the music of Michael Bialas since most players liked the game particularly because of his tunes.\u00a0 I have the .mod versions of his tracks, but it's really hard to make them work on the game boy sound chip. Maybe impossible. We'll see.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tanks to Nico of Hall of Light, who transferred my old project disk files to win format years ago, so that i can work with my original artwork today. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Engine: GB studio</p>\n<p>GFX Tools: Asprite, Pyxel edit<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:34:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fa/9fa0b83cc300d51c407fc2cb81aa5033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DonToraneko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
