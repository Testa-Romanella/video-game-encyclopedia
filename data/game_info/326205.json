While stealth and dialog choices were wanted, by the time the underlying systems were in place, those features needed to be cut.</p>\n<p><strong>What Made It</strong>: Dialog, portraits, basic backgrounds, custom triggers for dialog events, player skills (Hint Eye, Lockpick), and interaction with the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>What Didn't Make It</strong>: Gameplay (lol), sound, stealth gameplay, extended narrative, 4 planned characters to move the general story along.</p>\n<p><strong>What I\u00a0Learned</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Unity doesn't have to be all about underlying script systems. You can actually make progress with it!</li><li>This was my first jam, and people were very eager to show off their stuff. I\u00a0was happy to experience that.\u00a0</li><li>Sleep is important for game jams (YMMV)</li><li>It will be easier to go for core features next jam rather than large systems.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Font - \"Hello World\" - Anthony Gross<br/>Public domain, GPL, OFL<br/>https://fontmeme.com/fonts/hello-world-font/</p><p>Art feedback - GHPCDev</p><p>Please leave me feedback in the comments below or hit me up on Discord. ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T21:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bd/6bd4ef7eb8f548435b19adf2b144c192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kavi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
