I didn't make her with a straight face. Nevertheless, it does contain potentally<strong>\u00a0disturbing</strong>\u00a0images and ideas. Murderous<strong>\u00a0spiders</strong>, consumption of\u00a0<strong>human flesh</strong>, use of\u00a0<strong>syringes</strong>. rude\u00a0<strong>language</strong>\u00a0and<strong>\u00a0bad poetry</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was created by me,\u00a0<strong>Gargoolia</strong>, for the #123 Mini Jam.\r\n</p>\n<p>Backgrounds were made by Midjourey neural network. Music and sounds (well, SOUND) were taken from public domain resources.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Everything else\u00a0 (\u00a0texts, poems, character sprites, additional images and final illustrations) is made by me.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I didn't have enought time to finish the game properly. It is fully playable and has 3 endings. Although, the \"baby\" ending is lacking proper texts. I will fix everything soon.
