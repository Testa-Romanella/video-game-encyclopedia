Upon reaching the summit, they find a giant hole in the mountain along with what appears to be man-made structures. One of the climbers decides it's a great idea to just jump in there head first. What follows is an unfortunate time for the climber, as he falls through the earth, never to resurface. This is the story of SLING-MAN. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The gameplay of SLING-MAN is simple. You use the mouse pointer to click on parts of Sling-Man to drag him away from hazards such as Spikedudes or Blunt-Blades. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately though, Sling-Man is a fragile human. He dies in one hit so be sure to keep him away from spikes and also try to prevent him from getting carried off-screen. <br/></p>\n\n<p>There is an ending to this game to whoever makes it through the 6 areas in it. Be sure to post what your high score is.</p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 48 \u00a0in 72 hours<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T14:55:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c3/9c38584f0af26a14745756a4d925d37f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FlamingIceCubeGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
