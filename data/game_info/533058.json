So, there\u2019s a lot of presents left in Santa\u2019s workshops. The elves and Santa decided to fight a merciless battle with the rest of the toys to release the pressure accumulated before the holidays.</p>\n<p><strong>Your goal</strong>: You\u2019ll have to throw gifts at the elves to score points, while avoiding enemy fire. At the end of the game, the team with the fewest points will have to obey each other for next Christmas, so aim right.\u00a0Be careful, your\u00a0<strong>shots are limited</strong>, remember to reload on one of the piles of gifts to not fall dry.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>YEET THE GIFT</strong>\u00a0is a single player FPS game where your objective is to kill as many elves as possible before the timer stops.</p>\n<p>In order to do so, you will be given a<strong>\u00a0gun</strong>\u00a0with which you can shoot the elves. To avoid enemies shot, you can dash in a direction or shoot on their gift to protect yourself!<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard :\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Z, Q, S, D \u2013 Move</p>\n<p>Space \u2013 Jump</p>\n<p>Left Shift \u2013 Dash</p>\n<p>E \u2013 Reload\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Click \u2013 Shoot<br/><strong>QWERTY AVAILABLE!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Controller :</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left Joystick \u2013 Move<br/></p>\n<p>Right Joystick \u2013 Camera</p>\n<p>Cross or A \u2013 Jump</p>\n<p>L1/L2 or LB/LT \u2013 Dash</p>\n<p>Square or X \u2013 Reload\u00a0</p>\n<p>R1/R2 or RB/RT \u2013 Shoot</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Producer<br/></strong>Baptiste Figeac</p>\n<p><strong>Game Designers\u00a0</strong>\n<br/>Alexandre Begis<br/>Marcus Do Rego<br/>Oc\u00e9ane Famechon<br/>Stanislas Rado</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers\u00a0</strong>\n<br/>No\u00e9 Guillaumin\r\n<br/>Th\u00e9o Boldireff<br/>Yannis de Macedo<br/>Antoine Jeanselme</p>\n<p><strong>Artist\u00a0</strong>\n<br/>Jason Hameon<br/>Samuel Mebrek</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>This game was developed in 3 days for the\u00a0CHRISTMAS UNREAL JAM\u00a0\u00a0event which was organized by the\u00a0Institut de l\u2019internet et du multim\u00e9dia\u00a0in Paris.
