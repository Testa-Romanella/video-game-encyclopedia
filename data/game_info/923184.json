Who has more plants after time limitation win!</p>\r\nWe come up with a multiplayer AR game that you spawn plants and try to destroy other players' plants before it's fully grown. TRY to make more fully grown trees to get a higher score. <br/><br/>Link: https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/rootbattle-9", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T05:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5c/d5cea696296549a13a0b70c61707f542.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Suifang Zhou"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
