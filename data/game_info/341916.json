There are gender variations for each character, but currently I only have the male main character version of Part 1 completed. Each episode part will have a free demo that teases content.<br/><br/>Disclaimer:\u00a0Due to the game being released in parts (so that I can do it in manageable chunks), the game-play is short and there's still a lot I need to improve upon so if that doesn't appeal to you that's completely okay. This is my first time making a game, so feedback is greatly appreciated. Part 2 Will have more features, blinking reworked sprites with undressing, new reworked backgrounds, and it will be in ren'py.<br/><br/>Pairings:<br/>M/F<br/>M/M (coming soon)<br/>F/F<br/>MFF<br/><br/>Fetishes:<br/>creampie<br/>domination<br/>submission<br/>corruption<br/><br/>Do you have a specific fetish or type of character that you like seeing?\u00a0<br/><strong>The high priestess tier on patreon allows you to get your own episode version that won't affect other players.
