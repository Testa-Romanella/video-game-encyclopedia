Your goal is to conquer a sky tower that has 30 floors. There are two kinds of event that can happen\u00a0when you enter a floor: Combat Event and Merchant Event.</p>\n<p>In Combat Event, you have to defeat the enemy in order to gain currency and\u00a0proceed to the next floor, while in Merchant Event you can purchase\u00a0cards for your deck.</p>\n<p>Remember that every card will be discarded <strong>permanently</strong> after used. It's\u00a0likely that you might <strong>run out of cards</strong> during the combat event, which leads to game over, apparently. A tip is to keep track of\u00a0your deck composition and try to increase your total asset value (= sum of currency and deck value.)</p>\n<p>Inspiration credit to the great game Slay the Spire.</p>\n<p>(This game is made in 48 hours\u00a0during\u00a0GMTK Game Jam 2019.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T18:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b93/b930aff8c9c39026f02b00b0a59a51a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChichaST"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
