Keep it alive (that's the theme!) by bouncing it around like a volleyball, without letting it touch the floor (walls and ceilings are OK). This little guy seems to be hungry and loves the blue fruit seemingly appearing out of nowhere; bounce your new friend to these fruit to feed him and arbitrarily increase your score (self-worth).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>W or up arrow to jump<br/>A or left arrow, and D or right arrow to move left or right respectively<br/>Hold shift to move faster<br/>Space to reset the alien (and your score unfortunately) if he hit the floor</p>\n<p>These keys also interact with the alien: If you're holding the jump key while the alien is in contact with you, he'll bounce twice as high. If you're holding left or right while the alien is in contact with you, he'll bounce sideways instead of straight upwards.</p>\n<p><em>Don't fret, all fruit are actually reachable, although a few of the spawns are a bit difficult; they're randomly chosen right now, sorry.</em><br/><br/>I'd love feedback on the game feel of moving around in particular. I know it's finicky to bounce this thing around, but how much better do you think I could have made it and where/why did it absolutely suck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/44875fc077118a58a9f6d836f0a47af1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ramperkash"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
