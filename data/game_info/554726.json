After weeks of uneventful flights, his luck changes one fateful day, when he comes across a survivor: Lieutenant Lilia Kjellberg. And while this seems to have been a fortunate happenstance at first, Will soon finds himself at odds with the new addition to the crew, as their beliefs clash on a fundamental level.<br/><br/>Can these fellow surface pilots set their differences aside and work together to survive, or will their rivalry only hasten the JFK's downfall?<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>A kinetic (linear) visual novel with full Japanese voiceover, including a series first \u2014 a voiced protagonist! <br/></li><li>All-new user interface in a rebuilt engine designed for unprecedented system compatibility!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T02:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb0/fb01bf692fdd412110527b31f024a48b.jpg", "website": "https://muvluv.com/en/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 20, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 13, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anchor"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["aNCHOR"], "esrb_rating": null}
