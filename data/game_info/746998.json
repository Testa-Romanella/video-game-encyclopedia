Play as Charon on a node style map\u00a0and light up the river as ghosts wander around... purchase bubblegum with obols and get powerups to help you along your journey!</p>\n<p>Due to the procedural nature of the game, and the relatively short development time, there is the possibility of finding impossible maps, and other bugs yet unknown. Nonetheless, they are not game breaking in any way. Have fun!</p>\n<p>- - - -</p>\n<p>Eleutheria was created in a week for the Brackeys 2022.1 game jam, using the unity engine. It owes a lot of assets to previous projects that I could not or did not have the time to finish. It was developed to fit the node style map idea and bring it to life. Programming by Radkii. Playtesting and development help by Eboxy and Fritz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f75/f75c59dd2add86ca4eef2ee45e947ecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["radkii"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
