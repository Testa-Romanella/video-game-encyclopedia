Along the way, you're aided by mysterious wildlife that allow you to shift parts of the ground,\u00a0writing your name into the path before you. Will you create advantages for yourself and for others that come afterwards? Or will you contribute to the havoc of the spiraling monolith?</em>\n<p>Cairn is a \"live world\" homage to Jump King. It carries a lot of the mechanical and visual spirit of the game, but strives to be a little cheerier and significantly more chaotic by allowing players to completely morph the original experience of the game. Any change you make to the world is reflected in everyone else's game, the map you see now is a culmination of everyone's changes across the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T08:47:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/463/4639b982a3812f646d67fff8d82e5452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["torcado", "rubic", "Camera", "Kavol"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
