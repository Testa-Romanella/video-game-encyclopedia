The board might tip, spilling all of your precious points. <em>Oh noes!</em></p><p>The entire game is driven by a realistic physics simulation \u2013 so every time you play the challenge will be slightly different. Use the balance and motion of each Widdly to discover new high scoring techniques.</p><ul>\n<li>Easy to pick up and play, difficult to master</li><li>Simple 1-finger controls</li><li>9 Widdlies to test your skills</li><li>Colorful, abstract designs</li><li>No violence, kid friendly </li></ul><p>I'm offering this game for free, but you can also <em>Pay What You Want</em> to help support my game dev efforts.
