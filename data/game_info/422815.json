{"id": 422815, "slug": "chicken-ran", "name": "Chicken Ran!", "name_original": "Chicken Ran!", "description": "<p>- WASD &amp; mouse cursor to move and look around</p>\n<p>- Hold on left key to pick up item</p>\n<p>\"Chicken Ran!\" is a simple walking simulator embeded in a village scene, you play as a kid who lives in the village and raises chicken with grandfather.\u00a0 Due to the reason that chicken house is actually a jerry-built project, a wall of it suddenly collapsed at one night. Unfortunately, some chicken catched this chance and escaped. Thus, you have to survey the whole village and investigate the whereabouts of all missing chickens, otherwise it will be a big\u00a0loss for your family. This topic is relate to my childhood memories of living in a small village located in Northern China. In my impression, those troublesome domestic animals like chicken are an inseparable part of village life. I want to use this game to recall that part of memory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The process of making the game is really fun, I especially enjoyed the part of modeling and texturing in Blender. Designing those sprites and buttons of UI system is\u00a0relaxing as well. A good decision I made is making a checklist at the beginning stage of development, that's incrediblely helpful for me to work efficiently, rather than pushing everything back till the date of deadline. It's quite a pity that I didn't get everything I wanted in the final game, there used to be some little intermediate quests that players have to do before they find chicken, but I'm not a good coder and have to skip this idea. The game finally turns out to be a cozy walking simulator with hide and seek element. Anyway, I still feel satisfied for such final result.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Background music:<br/>Start menu - Sweet Child O' Mine, Guns n' Roses (8-bit remix cover)<br/>Instruction page - Black Dog, Led Zepplin (8-bit remix cover)</p>\n<p>Intermediate Game Development - Spring 2020</p>\n<p><em><strong>*The game file is relatively large, sorry for that!*</strong></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca48b2cf41d4ce0668cb975322bf292.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IsabellaChen"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
