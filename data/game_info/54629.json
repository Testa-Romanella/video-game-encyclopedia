{"id": 54629, "slug": "crazy-taxi", "name": "Crazy Taxi (1999)", "name_original": "Crazy Taxi (1999)", "description": "<p>Crazy Taxi is the renewed version of arcade machine title of the same name that was released in 1999. It\u2019s a taxi driver simulator. The goal of the game is to deliver passengers to their destinations, performing numerous tricks. The game also features 16 mini-games.</p>\n<p>Crazy Taxi follows the classic mechanics of score games: you need to get from a passenger as much money as possible. In the beginning you can choose a driver and a car; their stats are quite similar with slight differences in speed and turning. To raise your tips you need to reach the destination on time. To earn extra money you can perform multiple tricks, including drifts, jumps, near-misses, and combos of these moves. </p>\n<p>Driving through the city isn\u2019t that easy as it seems to be. There are numerous obstacles in your way, such as frustratingly slowly buses, that make you take risks during your maneuvers on the road. Moreover, the amount of potential passengers is limited: once you pick up a person, it\u2019s unavailable for the rest of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "1999-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-23T12:26:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d9b/d9bbb8e69f53c4c42b8ff928cb581548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 82, "owned": 1970, "beaten": 258, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 288, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 418, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 421, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 2", "Xbox 360", "PC", "iOS", "Android", "GameCube", "Dreamcast"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Acclaim Cheltenham", "Hitmaker", "Strangelite"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "Activision Value Publishing", "Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
