To escape the room you need to clear some puzzles and the final door will open, you can interact with the puzzles pressing \"E\" and pick some notes that will help you solve them. To access those notes you need to go to you inventory \"I\" and click on the note that you're interested in reading. Headphones are recommended to have the best experience!</p>\n<p>This game was a challenge that i made to myself in order to make a game in 3 days (Kind of a game jam made for me haha) because I do struggle in actually finalizing a game! The game may have some bugs and weird glitches, of course there are things that could be better (especially my drawing skills...) but i did learn a lot on making it!</p>\n<p>The purpose of the game was to create a 2D\u00a0creepy/scary game using only squares, i did my best to emulate a scary ambient and I hope it could get at least little gasp out of you :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T04:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/828a2f7ee17a116d7b26e46e60d29e97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
