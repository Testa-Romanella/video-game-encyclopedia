The theme was gravity, and we instantly thought to create a game where the main character is affected by it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the original version of this project wasn't playable past the first level. I've gone back over everything, fixed errors, and created 2 additional levels. We will\u00a0 not be finishing this project.</p>\n\n<p>The team:</p><p>Roy, who served largely as Lead Designer during the conceptual stage, who created the planets, and assisted greatly by creating the main menu. He was a good leader for the art, and he was happy to listen to and discuss any technical concerns that arose.</p><p>Ben, the quiet workhorse. He tackled the art so hard Roy was freed up for other tasks. He also helped with level design.<br/></p><p>Melanie, who created the backgrounds. Unfortunately, she was unable to complete the jam with us.</p><p>Gabe, who conceptualized and designed our main character, O'Ryan, and the Space Princess. <br/></p><p>Finally, Andrew (myself): I was the Technical Lead and Level Designer. I'm not a programmer by training, and it's painfully clear a real programmer would have done much better. This project was an opportunity to embrace a non-Designer role, and I appreciate how much I still have left to learn.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cc/3cc38387942fb3d24fa6ae01ad4f0318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D.Galga"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
