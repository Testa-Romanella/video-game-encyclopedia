Using only default\u00a0UDK assets (plus voice acting and music), it combines exciting combat, environment puzzles, and a narrative that tells the story of a galaxy where humanity mysteriously and suddenly vanished 1000 years ago leaving everything they created behind. Humanity's robotic creations, the Mechlons, now rule the galaxy using their abandoned cities and ships.<br/><br/>You play as Max, a scrappy and emotional Mechlon who seeks to discover humanity's fate by searching planetary ruins before the profiteering Dominus Corporation can strip them of their clues and riches. After discovering an uncharted planet, Max and his trusty side-kick Proxy, set off to finally discover the first piece of the puzzle that will reveal humanity's fate and the future fate of the Mechlons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A LETTER FROM THE DEVELOPER</strong></p>\n<p>I made\u00a0<strong><em>Lost Worlds</em></strong> as a way to build up my portfolio to get a job making AAA games.\u00a0It worked!
