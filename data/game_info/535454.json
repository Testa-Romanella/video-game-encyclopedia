You can move around, break down buildings, and breathe fire. I had wanted to add a way for the player to gradually add buildings and create a city that they can then destroy. Thinking about the way children enjoy building something to then destroy it. I think this game holds the potential for an interesting experience where the player creates something knowing it will be destroyed. For future development, I would like to see a balance between the creating and destruction stage. I want the player to feel enjoyment during the destruction stage otherwise it could be a sad experience.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T07:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70dafaf48f9598e6f176dbbcc88fac2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["avak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
