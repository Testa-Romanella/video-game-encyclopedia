Radioactivity can stack.</li><li>Other particles can become radioactive, and when they decay they launch a random particle at you.</li><li>Entanglement: When you take damage you have a chance to become entangled (a buffering icon will appear); the next time you collide with any particle there is a 50% chance that gravity is reversed.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T11:57:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a65f96951149b8e54de285ff5cfdacb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Immanent Death"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
