The effect... is pretty amazing.\u201d<br/>http://bit.ly/cFoTH1<br/><br/><br/>--- THE CONCEPT ---<br/><br/>STAND UP, look up and down, look around, AND SPIN (IN REAL LIFE!) to swiftly navigate through a series of disgustingly-real, endlessly-winding, anatomy-inspired tracts.<br/><br/>Thanks to our breakthrough \"Perspectiverse Engine\", you can use your iOS device like a movable window into a virtual three-dimensional world that coincides with the real world around you.<br/><br/>Though Gyromaniac runs on devices that can fit in your pocket, it's more akin to a motion-controlled home gaming experience, like the Wii or Kinect.  This is by no means a casual mobile game.<br/><br/><br/>--- FEATURES ---<br/><br/>- A new style of visceral, immersive motion-based controls intuitive even for non-gamers, but whose mastery will challenge the most sophisticated players.<br/>- \"Touchless\" gameplay: Gyromaniac can be controlled completely through your movements, without ever having to touch the screen.<br/>- Four Time Trial levels: Intestinal Fortitude, Colonoscapade, Capillary Action, and Fallopian Rhapsody, with more to come.<br/>- Multiplayer races in real-time spanning multiple devices over Bluetooth<br/>- Each time you play a level, the terrain generated will be random and unique, allowing for infinite replayability.<br/>- Stereoscopic 3D mode with Red/Cyan 3D glasses.<br/>- Uses no third-party engines or code, but powered by the homegrown Perspectiverse Engine.<br/><br/><br/>--- CREDITS ---<br/><br/>Concept, Design, Engineering<br/>Vishal Srivastava<br/><br/>Texture Art, Logos<br/>Wayne Price, Amos Manneschmidt, Jennifer C.
