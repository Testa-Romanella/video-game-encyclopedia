(If you want to try it, copy\u00a0the link into a browser if and when\u00a0it doesn't launch\u00a0-- sorry for the inconvenience!)</p>\n<p>Phew! It wasn't an easy theme this year. Jeff and I first spent a day thinking about it, and after <em>not</em> going with a chess variant ended up with this little word game. Who knew the English language had like 25k words that end with \"P\"?!\u00a0I wish I had time to draw many more images (I had wanted at least another 30 more), but alas, these will have to do. I'm thinking it could be fun to do similar challenges\u00a0but with different letters. Anyways, hope\u00a0you have fun trying it out, folks. We're now going out and rewarding ourselves with PIZZA. Thanks for the jam, NGJ 2021!\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>Coded (from scratch) by Jeff, illustrated by me.<br/>Music by Super Game Music (https://soundcloud.com/supergamemusic).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T06:35:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572e15238fcd72dfd59c1ff24c70a0ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Millefey"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
