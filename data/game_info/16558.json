The extra classic thugs will join a digital swarm entity that hunts the character. Achievements are divided in Resilience and Destruction to keep track of your survival and damaging skills. The faster pace, freedom of movement and updated class mods create a hardcore reflex based experience, shaped by community feedback on each volume of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T01:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24c8b3a4a9eef4d0dc6dcdb040d33deb.jpg", "website": "http://www.ubermosh.com", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 326, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Walter Machado"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Walter Machado"], "esrb_rating": null}
