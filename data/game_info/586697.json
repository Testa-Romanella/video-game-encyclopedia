Now he needs to find his inner peace with the help of his new 'friend'.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>AD or right/left arrows to move. A few objects in the game can be interacted with by using left mouse button.</p>\n\n<strong>Background:</strong>\n<p>A long time ago, I began to consider games not just as a pastime, but as a whole unique experience from which you can get aesthetic pleasure. \"Mr. Higgs ..\" doesn't contain many game elements. The main emphasis is on characters, visualization, atmosphere, music and so on, so that the player can both feel this world and enjoy it.</p>\n<p>As you might guess, this game is about the personal experience of dealing with depression and existential crisis. Each mini-challenge in the game is a visualization or reference to the pressing problems of depression that I had to go through. I managed to overcome many obstacles and difficulties on my way, and if you are still going down this path, then I very much hope that the story of Mr. Higgs will somehow help you and you will feel much better.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Art, idea, programming - GreedMN</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0</p>\n<p>GreedMN - One</p>\n<p>GreedMN - Dust</p>\n<p>Sparks - All That</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a05dd53c2ad68d93b46a187966384dba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["GreedMN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
