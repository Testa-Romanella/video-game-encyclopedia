{"id": 9712, "slug": "overgrowth", "name": "Overgrowth", "name_original": "Overgrowth", "description": "<p>Overgrowth is an indie action game developed by Wolfire Games. It serves as a sequel to Lugaru, another title by the company.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>On a fictional island of Lugaru, after many years after the extinction of humanity, the world is run by humanoid wolves, rabbits, rats, cats, and dogs.</p>\n<p>Most of Overgrowth&#39;s plot is not revealed yet, as the game is still in early access stage of production. The main character was carried over from the previous game. A rabbit named Turner that avenged his family by killing the Alpha wolf and a corrupt king. Turner refused to become the next king and left to explore the island.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Similar to the previous game, Overgrowth puts a strong emphasis on hand-to-hand combat. Attacks and counter-attacks are based on timing and contextual actions rather than the usual combos. </p>\n<p>The game features an advanced physics-based animation system which allows for seamless transitions between animations. Every animation will be different based on the environment, the character&#39;s mood and even individual traits. </p>\n<p>Levels in Overgrowth introduce the players to their environment, tasks, and means of completing such tasks. Despite that, the players are free to explore the level as they see fit. This allows the players to find their own path to level completion. </p>\n<p>The game features a sophisticated AI. The enemy characters can attack from the back or get together for an ambush. If the AI decides that it has no chance of winning, the enemies fall back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-01T07:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85b/85be8468eabaacadb361eb88e92ee41f.jpg", "website": "http://www.wolfire.com/overgrowth", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 136, "owned": 1592, "beaten": 47, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 67, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 450, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 102, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wolfire"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wolfire"], "esrb_rating": null}
