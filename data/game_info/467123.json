When you hit play you better be ready to go, because there is\u00a0no countdown, the race has started!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Press Tab to switch between Fixing mode and driving mode.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fixing mode, swap between the 9 systems to repair them as they break using the buttons in the bottom left.\u00a0Each system has a direct impact on your ability to fly your ship, and each system's status is shown on the bar at the top. 1 indicates that the system is currently working, while 0 indicates that it is currently broken. Some systems display a number which indicates their efficiency, and one displays a timer.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<p>In driving mode, use WASD to control your ship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Race Through the track and try to beat the Developer, ME.
