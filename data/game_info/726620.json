There you can sell the tower FOR coins, or upgrade the tower USING coins. If you get enough magic crystals, you can spend them on enhancing or spells.</p>\n<p>- The coin up there on the top right hand corner obviously tells you how much coins you have.</p>\n<p>- If an enemy crosses the path alive, you lose a Heart, you can see how much you have under the coins.</p>\n<p>- Magic is a new feature in the game. You get magic crystals by completing waves and defeating bosses. You can spend them in the magic shop to buy spells for defeating the enemies. Or you could use them to enhance your hero's. Click on a hero and next to the upgrade menu you can enhance them for a certain price. They will be able to shoot faster.</p>\n<p>!!!YOU CAN ONLY ENHANCE ONCE, DON'T DO IT TWICE!!!</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--Tips--</p>\n<p>- Ewo is a good guard at the end.</p>\n<p>- Nova is good for attacking multiple enemies.</p>\n<p>- Officer Nano is a normal tower you can put anywhere.</p>\n<p>- Bluu is a cyborg who doesn't have the best range.
