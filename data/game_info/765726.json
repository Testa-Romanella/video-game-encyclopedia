The current state of the projects allows objects to float around space independently with an initial velocity added to the objects. There are a few planets, also with separate gravity values and speeds, they revolve around the central star.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When an independent object comes close enough to a planet(enters its atmosphere), it can get into different states based on the speed and direction of the object. Either it can fall down and crash into the planet or it can stay in the satellite region of the planet, where it goes around the planet at a speed based on the object's speed when it entered this satellite region. The object also shows a trail of light when entering the atmosphere of a planet.</p>\n<p>Right now, you can play the simulation and change the speed of the simulation. The simulation can be paused with a pause button given at the bottom left of the screen. The speed of the simulation can be adjusted by a slider given at the bottom right of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T11:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afbe93add795063f0152e6332b3f0963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tickling Genre"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
