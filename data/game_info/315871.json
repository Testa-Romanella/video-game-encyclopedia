Each level, you\u2019ll wager how many lives you think you\u2019ll need to beat that level. If you run out of lives in your bank, it\u2019s game over. Finish the game with as many lives in your bank as you can!</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Too challenging? There\u2019s a secret hotkey that lets you skip levels. We put it in a link in case you want to avoid spoilers:\u00a0https://pastebin.com/ZFCQ2BaK</strong></strong><br/></p>\r\n\r\nDetailed Rules\r\n<ul><li>Each level will have a par value which is how many lives the level might take to beat.</li><li>If you bet that you can do better than par, you will be rewarded with extra lives.</li><li>If you wager more lives than par, you won\u2019t be rewarded and will lose the extra lives no matter what.</li><li>If you run out of lives on a level, you\u2019ll lose lives from your bank equal to par.</li></ul>\n<p>Try to beat all 15 levels without running out of lives! The amount of remaining lives is your score.</p>\n<p>Art, programming, and design by David Payette and Brad Beyea. Made with GameMaker Studio 2.
