These mechanics are spread throughout the world in the form of collectible objects/switches. Collecting/unlocking these mechanics adds more color to the game world and opens up new paths for the player to traverse. The goal is to unlock all the missing game mechanics so the player can finally reach the end and collect the final piece.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T09:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b4/4b4ba7c8578e7b2e9437db1458a7a272.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nantisde", "sinhash"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
