I am currently porting this work over to Monogame and will continue development on the game using that framework. In essence, this Love2D demo will <em>not</em> receive further work. Stay tuned for the Monogame port.\r\n<p>Version 0.3.4.1<br/></p>\n<p>Metal and Magic is a 2d sandbox game in the vein of Terraria. Explore the world, mine the environment and craft weapons and armor to equip yourself.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Navigating menus:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to select menu options.</li><li>Left click selects options in the menu.</li></ul>\n<p>Playing the game:</p>\n<ul><li>Left click: Use the item selected (pickaxe can mine blocks, blocks can be placed in the environment, swords can be swung).</li><li>Scroll wheel: Change current item selection to use</li><li>'A' key: Move left</li><li>'D' key: Move right</li><li>'Spacebar' key: Jump</li><li>'Escape' key: Pause/unpause the game.</li></ul>\n<p>When paused:</p>\n<ul><li>You can select an item in the crafting menu when you have the necessary items in your inventory. Left clicking the item will create it and place it in your inventory.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If\u00a0you\u00a0die\u00a0(typically\u00a0from\u00a0burning),\u00a0you'll\u00a0respawn\u00a0at\u00a0the surface.</li><li>There are no enemies to fight.</li><li>You can place blocks in midair without them being connected to anything.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>KNOWN BUGS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Here is the current list of known bugs in the prototype:</p>\n<ul><li>You are able to place blocks that occupy the same place as the main character. This can get you semi-stuck. Holding jump will cause you to rocket upwards until you get out of the blocks.</li><li>When you drag an item around in the pause menu, the hotbar (the first ten items that you can use during the game) UI will appear over the item being dragged around.</li><li>The water has some weird physics that are only temporary.</li><li>If you selected an item in the inventory and leave the inventory while it is still selected, it can cause more than one stack of an item to appear in the inventory when picking that item up (such as selecting a dirt block, then closing the inventory menu, then picking up another dirt block in gameplay). Placing the item and picking it up again will fix this problem. In a future patch, closing the inventory when an item is selected will auto-place the item into a free inventory slot.</li><li>Rockets will sometimes get stuck and never explode or move, or bounce at a weird angle.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:29:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/448/448315c6153ea46b0f627d7a629c1a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROC Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
