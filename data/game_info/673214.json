Dreamers can enter people's dreams and they are known to try to save people from having heart attacks from nightmares. Even though the dream\u00a0is just an illusion people can still die from heart attacks and this boy is very scared so it's your job to save him. When people are so scared they freeze up and when it happens in a dream time freezes and that will give you two seconds to kill their fears if you don't the person will die.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>WASD = MOVE</p>\n<p>E = INTERACT</p>\n<p>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO SHOOT (When time is frozen)</p>\n<p>P = PAUSE\u00a0</p>\n<p>Consume 20 chocolates and avoid a heart attack. Once you have 20 chocolates you need your BPM to be in the green, then once you are there will be an arrow to show you the direction.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry about the quit buttons not working right in the WebGL version.</p>\n\n<p>The music that was in the credits scene:\u00a0\"<strong>Royalty Free Music from Bensound</strong>\"</p>\n<p>The game music:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3B1zpsJ</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/stanberry.font?l[]=10&amp;l[]=1</p>\n<p>If you care I probably spent around 17 hours but I'm not\u00a0 100% sure.</p><p>submitted around\u00a04 pm sunday</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c09d58dad1eced2c4ef4a98274a5f93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dempsey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
