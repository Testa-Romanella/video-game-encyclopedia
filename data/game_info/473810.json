She feels disconnected from her surroundings. Her terrace is\u00a0in disarray, full of<br/> dead plants and unused objects. Unexpected visitors like a stray cat and birds arrive and<br/> leave her seeds. Through planting these seeds and tidying up the space, you can help her feel<br/> grounded and have a positive outlook on life once again.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project was developed by students of Bauhaus-University Weimar<br/> for the project<em> Experimental Games Lab</em> and is currently a demo.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Julia Synnatzschke - Art &amp; Design</p>\n<p>C\u00e9sar Daher - Programming</p>\n<p>Mudassir Sheikh - Music and Sound Design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6c/c6c7202e1c6057fbd6f82e6a98615d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Terrace"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
