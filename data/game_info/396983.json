It's not just a great music system, but it is the best driver experience you could ask for.

At the end of this game there are two teams of 5 players with two players in each base, both in pairs. These two bases are outside the game's 24-hour timeframe which requires those who win to be fast and have a long supply line. The order to open the new bases is as follows: 1. First player to build a ghost gate, then production buildings. 2. Second player to open up the first base<br/>-\u00a0Thurlow Weed, Brave New World\r\n<strong>This game is</strong>\u00a0now afterthoughts, as Nintendo opted to go with 3DS support instead, despite having numerous titles available through traditional avenues that could be played on a 3DS, such as Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.
