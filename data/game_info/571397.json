During a historic war with a neighbouring nation, the Grand Mage cast a spell to summon magical spirits from plants, stone and the sky to act as warriors to protect the kingdom. These spirits grew out of anyone's control and even after the war ended, continue to menace the nation.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The story follows the journey of a young male witch, Dason, who has been trained in the ways of Lunar Magic.<br/>On the death of Dason's grandmother, he's left without family (his parents died when he was born). However, he discovers letters his father sent him, which his grandmother kept hidden.</p>\n\n<p>Along with his partner Shaun - a blade artist - Dason decides to set off to Borealia: a town in the far north where the letters came from, in the hope of reuniting with his father and only surviving family.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, they meet a young non-binary Solar Mage called Alix who decides to join them on their journey.
