The game is like an  endless runner but with the levels created by me. It's main concept is that you can flip or invert the world. I went for a rage quit kind of game in it's hardest form but with a check point system for people that want to play the easier version.<br/></p>\n<p>You should be able to play the pico-8 version on this page or through the bbs here:<br/>https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=117660#p</p>\n<p>I also have a little bit of a devlog over at the playdate forum that you might be interested in https://devforum.play.date/t/invert-world-devlog-some-help-needed/8749/15</p>\n<p>I will be adding a few little features to the playdate version soon. Like distance travelled in the main hud and particle effects.<br/></p>\n<p>I will extend the length of this game if people like it. Just comment below if you do and I'll do something like 2x the length for 100 comments and 4x the length for 1000.<br/><br/>I've updated the pdxinfo file to include the games name. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T12:42:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1eb87acaf0eb8ee572f6aaeaa41bacc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["anefiox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
