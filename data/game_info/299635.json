You can choose who to buy from and who to sell to, as well as the shipping vessel. <br/>\r\nBut this is not the whole story: you need to keep your employees happy, take sound financial decisions, watch out for unforeseen troubles and potential game-ending scenarios. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe context plays a decisive role and will impact the success of your company. The macroeconomic and political developments of the single countries affect prices as well as public perception.<br/>\r\nRemember, every move that you make, every context-driven event that happens, has an impact on your company and will manifest sooner or later. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose your own path: a greedy profit-centric corporation or a social and environmental conscious company. It all depends on you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMango Cart is a turn-based game: every month you get mandatory tasks to complete and events to check before advancing to the next stage. Additionally, a number of actions are available to you at any time, and a set of external events will pop-up when you least expect them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are several game-ending scenarios but no game-winning target. You can potentially play the game endlessly. At the start of each new year your performance is compared with 4 your competitors: this is where you can check if your company is progressing as expected.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExpect more features, new and enhanced game mechanics with the upcoming releases\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\n...and join the community or simply contact AkriGames to suggest new events or things you would like to see added to the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a5878325e64fa3807e0ba3ded44297fb.jpg", "website": "https://www.akrigames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AkriGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["AkriGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
