{"id": 928766, "slug": "elemental-adventure-2", "name": "Elemental Adventure", "name_original": "Elemental Adventure", "description": "<h3>Overview</h3>Elemental Adventure is a fast paced action rpg with a focus on build diversity. Featuring 8 distinct classes each with 12 unique skills, the possibilities are endless! Further enhance your elementals with powerful gems crafted to exactly fit their needs. What's more, respecing is free! So you can try new builds and tweak them to perfection as much as you want! Not only that, but Elemental Adventure doesn't feature any silly quests or NPCs to talk to, fight, level up, and then fight some more! Nothing slows down the action! (except reading tooltips, there are a lot of tooltips) Progress your way through the campaign until you reach the endgame where you will face powerful bosses. Each you defeat will grant you a boon to prepare for the final challenge! So what you waiting for, get out there and explode some balls of energy!<br/><br/>Try the demo!<br/><h3>Robust Progression</h3>Elemental Adventure is all about leveling up, from the elementals you play as, their skills, and the gems they equip, everything levels up! This grants you skill points to customize exactly how you want to destroy your enemies! Are you a slow and methodical tank? A blur of destruction? Do you lay down massive AoEs to catch your enemies? Maybe you fire barrage after barrage of projectiles at them? Or perhaps some wild combination of all that and more!<br/><h3>Story</h3>Elemental Adventure features absolutely no story! You probably don't even need to read the tutorials! There's nothing to slow you down, fight, level up, fight some more! And you know what else? You don't get penalized for dying! Failed a hard level? You still get some experience so you can tailor your build for the next try!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T03:56:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/7123671db2bc65581f50e10917f785e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ZathGames"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ZathGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
