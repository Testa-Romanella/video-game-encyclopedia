However, I've built a WebGL version playable in the browser from the same original source code to make it easier for people to try it out.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Feedback/Bugs and Planned Adjustments (Holding changes until after LD48 voting concludes as per the rules):</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Feedback:</strong>\u00a0Players can move their character to either side of the screen and only drill down when hitting a platform.<ol><li><strong>Planned Adjustment:</strong>\u00a0Introduce non-drillable blocks on the walls.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong>\u00a0It is hard to hit enemies, and easy to avoid them.<ol><li><strong>Planned Adjustment:</strong>\u00a0Increase the size of the hitbox of damaging abilities.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong>\u00a0There is little incentive to engage with enemies. I can just ignore them.<br/><strong>Planned Adjustment(s):</strong>\u00a0<ol><li>Increase risk of ignoring enemies by (1)\u00a0increasing the speed of enemy attacks, (2)\u00a0introducing additional enemy attacks that force a response (e.g., attacks that follow the character), and (3) increasing the length of each level so that taking damage is a more significant concern.</li><li>Increase reward from engaging with enemies by\u00a0introducing rewards for\u00a0killing enemies such as health pick ups or persistent currency used to buy stat increases or new abilities.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong>\u00a0There is little incentive to engage with platforms. I can just ignore them.<ol><li><strong>Planned Adjustments:</strong> Increase the width of some platforms. Introduce non-drillable platforms. Discontinue rewarding Drill charges for landing on a platform.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Feedback:\u00a0</strong>It is satisfying to line up attacks to hit multiple enemies or to time drilling accurately.</li><ol><li><strong>Planned Adjustments:</strong>\u00a0Introduce more opportunities for players to exhibit these skills (e.g., more platforms to drill through, more opportunities to line up multiple enemies),\u00a0and increase the benefit of exhibiting these skills (greater rewards from multikills or \"perfect timing\").</li></ol></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Additional\u00a0Planned Features:</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Persistent currency used to enhance stats / abilities, rewarded from good play</li><li>Sound effects</li><li>More animations</li><li>More stat trackers</li><li>Better communication regarding your current number of jump charges, drill charges, and health.</li><li>Better communicate iFrame states.</li><li>Better transitions between levels.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:54:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/073a70a19606798f287d7528f6cdd942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["occa software"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
