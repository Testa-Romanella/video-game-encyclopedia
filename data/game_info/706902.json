The player can also pick up weapons on the floor to throw them. Upon death, the player may upgrade their attribute points with the bananas collected throughout the run.</p>\n\n<p>Controls to the game are relatively simple and easy to pick up:</p>\n<p>W - Move Up</p>\n<p>A - Move Left</p>\n<p>S - Move Down</p>\n<p>D - Move Right</p>\n<p>Mouse -\u00a0Look direction<br/></p>\n<p>Spacebar - Use Ability</p>\n<p>Mouse Scroll - Change Ability</p>\n<p>Mouse Left Click - Attack</p>\n<p>Mouse Right Click - Interact</p>\n\n<p>Team Notes/Post-Mortem</p>\n<p>In terms of the development of the game, our team really wanted to make the combat as satisfying as possible and also create a way for the player to progress in power and gain new abilities as the core feedback loop. The ability to select different attributes to level and change stats was our way of providing players with a unique experience for every run and making the game something players would want to continue playing. We wanted to give the player the freedom to choose a gameplay experience while still following EscAPE's core mechanics.</p>\n<p>Throughout the process, we did make changes to our concept specifically with how the progression would work with abilities versus attributes and how the player would acquire each.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Additionally, we made changes to our level design and whether levels would be pre-set or randomly generated.\u00a0We also decided to try and implement some lore/story elements but that was a later priority.<br/></p>\n<p>In the end, we certainly felt like we did a good job solidifying the concept of the game. Our main goal in creating this game\u00a0was to get a core understanding of the entire process of game design while making a playable game to the best of our ability.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We definitely learned a lot about core game design fundamentals as well as basic gameplay implementations and gained experience in the whole process of game development from sound design and art to level design and game programming.\u00a0It has exposed us to all facets of the game developer world and definitely sparked some interest in the industry and its specializations.\u00a0However, we definitely got held up on implementation details for our game as the majority of the group is not too experienced with programming and likely were too eager with proposing\u00a0these systems for our level of knowledge.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T17:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f01e00c9b24a811c506e15a1753e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fallensh"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
