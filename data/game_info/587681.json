In this game there are many levels with different tasks, to complete them you will need ingenuity and dexterity, and sometimes even strategy.<br/>  To hit all the enemies, it's worth practicing on the targets, as the controls are unusual, but pretty straightforward.<br/>  You will have to strain both hemispheres of the brain, since you need to control each hand separately, aiming and hitting the target clearly, because the ammo is limited, but this can be fixed by going into the store and pumping weapons as you earn coins.<br/>  Everything is done in 3D graphics with unobtrusive musical accompaniment, which is suitable for any age.<br/>  For more interest, we added exclusive stars and achievements, try to collect them all;) And most importantly - defeat all the cowboys and become the best shooter in the wild west!  Good luck with the game :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T02:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bd/7bd14e90037d0a2afd92da8a26b77ad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 420, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
