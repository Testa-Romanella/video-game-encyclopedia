The download comes with a script (Wii_remote.PIE) that, when run with glovepie, allows you to use a wii remote to play, yet keyboard support is also included.</p>\n<p>After running the exe it will take a little while to boot up. The program uses the GPU, so some antiviruses may try to block it - just allow the file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T06:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/215/2157ff325d926acfbbd8a879f98bfe50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeanzOnToest"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
