{"id": 156271, "slug": "chainraid", "name": "ChainRaid", "name_original": "ChainRaid", "description": "<p>This game is a prototype for a chain puzzle game (that is link chains of symbols to get some effect) where you fight enemies that grow stronger every three encounter.</p>\n<p>It lacks a lot of polish (no music, no cool effect or even any clarity as to how the combat system works in game, etc.) but allowed me to learn a fair bit so that's cool.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>The game is played with the mouse, hold left click to select a symbol and drag over adjacent symbols to extend the chain. Release to trigger the chain.</p>\n<p>After collecting five chains, the player and the mob will trade blows and if no winner is found, a new round will begin. The stats used are the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Power - increased by swords, this is the damage you will deal to your opponent at the end of the roud. Your\u00a0power\u00a0is\u00a0reset\u00a0after\u00a0each\u00a0round.</li><li>Armor - increasesd by shields. Damage done to you will first be taken by your armor. Your armor is reset after each battle.</li><li>Health - healed by hams. If you are fully healed, hams will increase your moral instead.</li><li>Moral - increased by creating long chains (10 symbols of more) or healing when full health. Your moral modifies the amount of stats you gain from the chains from -25% to +25% depending on its value. Moral is lost upon taking damages to your health and tend to stabilize towards 50 between each encounter.</li><li>Silver - your reserve of silver, increased by the silver balls, no use as of now.</li><li>Renown -  your renown is increased by the red balls, no use as of now.</li></ul>\n<p>Also, the stats of every enemy can be found and modified in the Cultures.json file and new groups of enemies can be added to it.<br/></p>\n<p>PS: the main menu is a bit buggy after a run but it should not be too problematic.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c768af5f5c6c62a198014683dfbf3ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ptafix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
