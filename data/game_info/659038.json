I made this game on the theme OPPOSITE. The game I made is called DUMB DIE. In many games, we have to collect the healths, powerups, or anything that is in the favor of the player to survive the game. But, here you have to do the opposite of it. You have to collect the item which causes damage to the player. So, you have to collect the bomb and take damage to win the game. And in opposite taking damage increases your score and taking healing decreases. And that power-up just slows down your player. The main motive of this game is just to take the damage till the health becomes zero as soon as possible. The fast you bring down the health, the fast you win. I hope you will like the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p><p>Here the objective is to make the player health down as soon as possible. Hearts and powerups are the obstacles. The heart gives you more health and takes scores. PowerUp makes your movement slow instead of increasing. the Bomb is your friend which will lead you to win. And this is the opposite of many games which we usually play.</p><p><strong>CONTROL:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Moving Left : D\r\n</p>\n<p>Moving Right: A\r\n</p>\n<p>Jumping: W or Spacebar\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Arts:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I did it myself.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I found this music from a website.\r\n</p>\n<p>https://www.chosic.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects Pack 2 by Swiss Arcade Game Entertainment (itch.io)\r\n</p>\n<p>Ta Da Sounds | Effects | Sound Bites | Sound Clips from SoundBible.com<br/></p>\n<p>Superepic by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n\n<p><strong>THANKS FOR PLAYING</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/505240015b7d474075cd54e8dd10b093.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jordan_Jack_1"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
