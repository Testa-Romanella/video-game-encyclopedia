You have to sort out which water bottles were properly manufactered, and which bottles are defective. If you fail to do so, you will get fired by the water bottle company. Obviously every employee needs to be able to sort water bottles at a superhuman rate. That's just normal!</p>\n<em>How to play:</em>\n<p>For every bottle on the conveyor belt, you have to compare it to the reference water bottle, in between the two buttons. If it matches, you press the \u2714 button, and if it doesn't, you press the \u274c button. If you press the correct button, you will gain a point (in the top right corner). On the chance that you press the incorrect button, the bar in the top left will go down, indicating how annoyed your employer is. The bar does, however,\u00a0slowly go back up if you sort enough bottles correctly. If that healthbar goes all the way\u00a0down, though,\u00a0you can essentially kiss your job goodbye.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T04:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a307fbadf11f00e205a4563f07a431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["personion"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
