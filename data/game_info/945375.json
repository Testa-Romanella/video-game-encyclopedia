The idea is not to make this a full release game, just to build my knowledge of game development and grow/fuel my creativity.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay currently features the following:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Player movement (WASD) with dashing (LShift)</li><li>Cursor pointed attacking, (LMouse, Main Attack:\u00a0RMouse, Secondary Attack)</li><li>6 different attacks with ways to combine/buff each with the secondary attack.</li><li>3 enemy types (Melee, Ranged, and Mini Boss)</li><li>Player leveling that scales the enemy spawn rate and Player attack speed/projectile size/projectile amount/and more!\u00a0</li><li>2 very basic maps with lackluster quality assets. You gain access to the second map after completing the first level.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p>What I would like to do that would make this \"Finished\"\u00a0in my brain:</p>\n<ul><li>Self-made pixel art\u00a0assets that depict my own image of what the game looks like.\u00a0</li><li>Minimum 3 different complete\u00a0maps</li><li>Minimum 6 new enemy types</li><li>Minimum 4 additional player attack types with ways to combine attacks.</li><li>Improve current attacks to make more meaningful and varying\u00a0combinations.</li><li>Fluid UI/player control</li><li>More extensive progress saving/loading</li><li>Leaderboards</li></ul>\n\n<p>What I may do, if I\u00a0feel like it:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Create a skill tree that the player could then use to select which spells are scaled with each level up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Gear for the player that buffs stats in different ways.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T07:49:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c8055cbd37b18e6799074eace1ebf5c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Malsar"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
