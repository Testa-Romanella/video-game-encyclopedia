In reality, it's all a cover for government sanctioned research on\u00a0<strong>MIND CONTROL </strong><strong>TECH</strong>.</p>\n\r\nEverything was going fine... until today.\u00a0\r\n<p>Suddenly, the MIND CONTROL signals from other \"Pet Trainers\" across the country started interfering with your pets. You've lost control and they've escaped the facility.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not only that, but electrical fallout from the EMP Wars of 2062 is still rampant.\u00a0You must protect the animals, but you can only control one at a time...</p>\n<p><strong>GOOD LUCK!</strong></p>\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 How to Play\r\n<p>Your pets have escaped the facility!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can MIND CONTROL one pet at a time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While you are controlling one pet, the others will be throwing themselves into harm's way.</p>\n<p>Your goal: keep the animals from running into the electrified EMP fields.</p>\n<p>Complete 9 Levels, then\u00a0survive as long as you can in Level 10, the Infinite Challenge Mode! Levels can played in any order!</p>\ud83e\udde0 Online Multiplayer?? (Sort Of)<p>You can name and record a movement pattern for a character. That character will then appear in other player's games. Other player's mind-controlled characters will appear in your game as well!</p>\r\n\ud83c\udfae Controls\r\n<p>Controller Recommended!

This can be very annoying, unfortunately... feel free to close the game if you encounter this - your progress is saved automatically!</li><li>The electrified walls in Levels 8 and 9 are meant to move.
