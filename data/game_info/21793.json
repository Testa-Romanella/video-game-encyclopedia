With the peak of humanity far behind, their world is a mausoleum to a lush and verdant Art Deco past.\"<br/><br/>In Cult of the Wind, players compete and cooperate in ritualistic multi-player human dogfights, complete with imaginary weapons, pretend explosions, and airplane noises made with their mouths. Shower your friends in a hail of imaginary bullets and proclaim, \"I got you! You have to lie down,\" to which they respond, \"Nuh-uh, I have a shield.\" You argue about whether or not airplanes can have shields, meanwhile some other guy does a cannonball onto your head while whistling. It's great. <br/><br/>With an intuitive point-and-click level editor you'll be able to craft new levels or modify existing ones, then immediately share them with anyone on a server, even if you aren't the host. You can also craft a personalized appearance for your character with numerous articles of clothing and more. <br/><br/><ul><li> Simple, robust level editor <br/></li><li> Instantly share your creations with others <br/></li><li> Character customization <br/></li><li> Dozens of imaginary weapons and abilities <br/></li><li> Infinitely expandable content <br/></li><li> Blindingly high-speed mock combat <br/></li><li> Weird noises </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2a4ba7b4e0de8f60f0a35c970f4b884.jpg", "website": "http://www.cultofthewind.com", "rating": 1.68, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 29, "owned": 740, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 25, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["North of Earth"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["North of Earth"], "esrb_rating": null}
