You play as an astronaut who has to escape from Mars before the alien boss triggers his ultimate weapon. If you fail to escape, the weapon will have an unexpected side-effect and you will be caught in a time look.\u00a0Depending on the location you are in, there are a number of actions available. These actions may be further limited by previously performed actions. However, there is no artificially imposed limitation, thus adding to the realistic nature of the game.</p>\n<p>In order to escape you must repair the rocket and fuel it. For fueling you have two options: a nearby fuel supply, within walking distance, and a larger far away fuel supply, requiring travel by rover. You must take into account that your actions require oxygen and you cannot go without eating. Therefore, you should periodically return to base and replenish the air supply as well as eat.</p>\n<p>The game makes use of AI-generated images. As far as I know this is the first game created with AI-generated images. If I'm mistaking, please let me know via comments or other channels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game engine is developed by me and was previously used in creating Jenna's Virtual Life.
