{"id": 659583, "slug": "crop-rotation", "name": "Crop rotation (itch)", "name_original": "Crop rotation (itch)", "description": "<p>A tiny endless farming game where you need to create a terrain and rotate your crops\u00a0to farm as long as you can!</p>\n<p>Created during the Kenney Game Jam 2021, using only Kenney assets, and Unity 2021.</p>\r\nBase Controls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Pause/Unpause</strong> the game using the <strong>spacebar</strong>.</li><li><strong>Rotate</strong> your buildings during placement using the <strong>Mouse scrollwheel</strong>.</li></ul>Quick Start:<p>Start by placing tiles and a continuous path\u00a0in front of your farm, On the next week, a tractor should start planting corn along the path if empty tiles exists. Once you have quite a few fields planted, start thinking about crop rotation to let your tiles recover after a harvest. You can do that manually by rotating tiles, or automatically using windmills.</p>Detailed Instructions:\r\n<p>The goal is to produce more and more food from your corn fields, thanks to your tractors.\u00a0To achieve that, you have several tools at your disposal:</p><ul><li><strong>Place a new tile:</strong>\u00a0Expand your current land by placing a new tile on screen. Tiles will start with a random fertility level.</li><li><strong>Rotate tiles:</strong>\u00a0Tiles can be rotated manually. However it will rotate the selected tile and all the neighboring tiles.</li><li><strong>Farm:</strong> This building will spawn a tractor each week.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Tractors</strong> have to follow a continuous path, and will plant new fields on empty tiles along the path, as well as harvest existing fields.</li><li><strong>Fields: </strong>These can't be created directly, but have to be planted by tractors. A field will take 5 weeks to reach a state where it is able to be harvested. But while growing, the corn will use some of the tile fertility. Tile fertility will be regained once the tile is empty again, and via pastures. A fertile tile (represented by how green it is) will produce twice as much food.</li><li><strong>Pastures: </strong>These\u00a0cute sheeps will help fertilize your land 200% faster.</li><li><strong>Windmills:</strong> Windmills will rotate automatically its tile and the neighboring tiles at the beginning of each week.</li><li><strong>Paths: </strong>Paths are the only way for your tractors to move. They must start in front of a farm, and\u00a0be continuous. There is a maximum distance each tractor can cover weekly.</li></ul><p>Finally, food: A fertile tile will produce twice the food an exhausted tile will. That is why crop rotation will help you survive longer. Each week you will automatically sell more and more food, so constantly expand your production!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T13:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cfbec5a6b0589df8571afa8205e483d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kay14"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
