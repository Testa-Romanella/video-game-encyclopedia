(2017)</p>\n<p>\"Roaring Streets!\" is a turn-based shooter in which every mechanic is tied to the arrow keys.</p>\n\n<p>How does the submission match the jam's theme?</p>\n<p>In \"Roaring Streets\", every mechanic can be controlled through the player's turn based movement. Move to evade enemies, or move into enemies to shoot them. But with every move, the game cycles through your inventory of weapons, forcing you to have to balance evasion, attacks, and gun types within a single movement. The movement mechanic serves a triple purpose!</p>\n<p><strong>The game currently runs on Windows only.
