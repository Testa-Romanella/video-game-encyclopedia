After doing my daily wanking on sakuya futa porn, istarted plugged my Nintendo pc985, and I started playing the OFIICCIAL beta of tofu projectrectum 1!!!!! Highly constipative to ballers (or ballas in the hood) Ok so when I started the game, I saw reimu from tohou project made by zun junya ota with hyperrealistic eyes!!!!!! OMG!!!!! I AM SCREMING WHILE I CAME ON MY FUMO COLLECTION like evcery touhou fan right BUT I didn\u2019t really think of it, I thought it was a glitch, so I kept playing I continued playing the game. The game had only one option!!!!! \u201cpress start to play\u201d I presed start and started the game The stage one started like normal. The only problem is that the background looked hyperrealistsic, like a REAL photo, all the blocks looked normal, only that they had reimu hakurei faces, weird\u2026and reimu looked badly drawn. And when the blocks were destroyed, the rock vine effect sound was played!!!!! Wow!!!! So scary!!!! Also the timer was stuck at 666!!! Very scare!!!! Aaaaaaaaa!!!! I kept playing\u2026.BUT the levels were getting VERY scarier\u2026.the reimus looked sad, and then they bled blood from their eyes.;;;;; But I thought it was only a glitch and I continued playing and then reimu started being realistsic and very scary and im crying and then se came out of my screen and said\u2026.
