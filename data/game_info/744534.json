In case you forgot, you are a tiny goblin gnome that died trying to carry an anvil across quicksand. Wow, you are pretty dumb. Now you are sentenced to roam this land as it's lone inhabitant. I have no clue who created this hellish landscape, God probably, but he didn't feel the need to make trees physical so you are welcome to run through them. Considering how you died I'm sure you were going to try to run through a tree anyway though. Since you are now a ghost, you fall very slowly. This world is idiot proof, perfect for the likes of you! Also, there is a treasure around here somewhere that does something you could never imagine, I recommend finding it. Now roam tiny goblin gnome! Go and discover what you can! I'll be here laughing at you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77fe6de6b66eee34d6b7fdd1cea03523.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["max-pike-4"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
