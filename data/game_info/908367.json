The whole globe went dark for 6.9 hours. It was a strange phenomenon that had never happened before. You got up in the morning and went to work as per usual for the opening shift at Wallshart.\u00a0 As the clock ticked closer to 9am you realised you were the only one there... everyone's alarms must have been reset last night. None of your co-workers had arrived. You looked to the opposite store, a hunting shop called Capri-Gun. No one in there either.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Abnormally angry people start to arrive, 08.56am. You need to open in 4 minutes. The shoppers are angrier than usual like their Karen mode had been enhanced by the lack of internet access last night.<br/><br/>08.57am you start to walk to the door, shaking in your boots. Peering out the door, you see men, women, and children frothing at the mouths, holding wallets and yelling, \"WHERE ARE THE SALES GR BARK BARK BARK\" (08.58am) and \"LET US IN SO I CAN BY A NEW TV\" (08.59am) then you remember, <br/>1. This is Ohio<br/>2. This is America.<br/> <br/>You can't possibly survive in this store on Black Friday, especially by yourself, with one week of retail training. 09.00am.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Welcome to\u00a0<strong><em>Retail Therapy</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Virtual Mistake Members -\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Holly Strutt\u00a0</strong>(Enemy Spawning,\u00a0Level Design, Story &amp; Video Editing)\u00a0<br/>https://hollystrutt.xyz</p>\n<p><strong>James\u00a0 Munnis\u00a0</strong>\u00a0(Core VR Mechanics, Weapon Mechanics &amp; Enemies)\r\n<br/>https://jamesmunnis.carrd.co/</p>\n<p><strong>Paris Mutter</strong>\u00a0(UI, Audio Systems &amp; Logo Design)<br/>https://octr.dev<br/></p>\n<p><strong>James Shore</strong> (Weapons Design)\r\n<br/>\r\nhttps://sketchfab.com/CannonMonkey\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T11:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44b037c0006245fb38865cf356235390.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["holly", "Paris", "LexPew"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
