To stop this for once and for all, Sphor decides to attack. Deep inside an ice cave, Sphor gets attacked by an extremely large army of ice guardians. It is now up to you to make sure Sphor survives as long as possible.</p>\n<p>You have one spear that you use to destroy enemies. Don't forget to pick it up once you want it back!
