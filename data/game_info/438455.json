The corporation has been abducting multiple species of animals and turning them into cyborgs as part of a military experiment. Angry that his identity was stripped away against his will, the flamingo sets out into the city to find his captors and exact revenge. Along the way he encounters fully converted robotic animals that attempt to stop him from progressing through the city. As he progresses he upgrades himself with robotic enhancements to more effectively combat enemies. In doing so he is visually becoming the thing he is seeking to destroy. Upon penetrating a large defense the player confronts the boss and ends the game. </p>\n\r\n\r\nProject Contributors:\r\n<ul><li>\u00a0<strong>N</strong><strong>athaniel Lawter</strong>/Production &amp; Level Design\r\n (Documentation, Level Design, Creative Director)</li><li><strong>\u00a0Juan Quevedo</strong>/Art \r\n (3D modeling, Characters, Rigging &amp; Animation)</li><li><strong>\u00a0Heather Miller</strong>/Art \r\n (3D modeling, Characters, Rigging &amp; Animation)</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Alex Hoffman</strong>/Texture Art (Texturing, Environment Art)</li><li><strong>\u00a0Nicolas Lotruglio</strong>/Art \r\n (Art, Player programming, UI/UX Design)</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Justin Snell</strong>/Production \r\n (Producer, UI/UX Design,programmer)</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Devin Fitzgerald </strong>/Programming\r\n (Programmer)</li><li>\u00a0<strong>Edward Tavarez</strong>/Programming\u00a0(Programmer, Combat Design)</li></ul>\r\nFull\u00a0Walkthrough:", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938dda803732f88e3b1f49045ac7c564.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justinjfl"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
