{"id": 853098, "slug": "mole-rat-prototype", "name": "Mole Rat Prototype", "name_original": "Mole Rat Prototype", "description": "<p>In an underground dirt tunnel -\u00a0where sunlight rarely enters - a mole rat begins harvesting food for her\u00a0children. Help the mole rat\u00a0complete her task in this very bare bones survival-exploration game.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>The objective in this game\u00a0is to Collect enough worms to sustain the mole rat's pups through the cold winter season.</p>\n<p>Worms are the main resource of the game.</p>\n\n<p>They\u00a0can be found hiding near mounds of dirt. If a worm is alerted of the mole rat's presence, they will hide. The mole rat can dig to retrieve a worm from its hole.\u00a0The worms can be brought back to the nest .</p>\n\r\nThey can be drop of in the designated feed zone.<br/>\n<p>The worm meter will fill as more worms are collected. The white marker indicates the minimum amount of worms\u00a0required for some of the mole rat's\u00a0children to survive. If the meter is filled, all her children survive.<br/></p>\n<p>While exploring, only three worms can be carried at a time. Carrying more worms causes the mole rat to move slower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As time progresses,\u00a0the pups'\u00a0health will begin to decrease due to hunger. Make sure to monitor their health and feed them periodically otherwise they'll die. They can be fed by dropping worms next to them. They will regain a large amount of health from eating worms.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nUse the HUD to monitor the monitor the mole rat's health and stamina, in addition to her children's.<br/><br/>\n\r\nNino del Tierra live in the tunnels as well.\r\n<p>Nino del Tierra (aka:\u00a0NDT) are slow, simple, enemies but they do inflict severe damage. The mole rat has to be in close proximity of a NDT\u00a0to alert one. NDT's\u00a0move quick when they became aware of the mole rat's position. NDT's also\u00a0deal a fair amount\u00a0of damage when they make contact with the mole rat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the mole rat dies her children starve to death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Certain walls can be dug into as well. This will cause then to collapse\u00a0and\u00a0allow the mole rat to\u00a0explore areas that were previously closed off.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nDiggable walls look different next to regular dirt walls.\r\n<p>Digging in the ground will create a hole (only if no worm is found there). Holes are useful for leaving land marks, or as impromptu obstacles to block an enemy's path.</p>\n\n<p>Burrowing is also\u00a0a quicker way of escaping from an enemy. Keep in mind that burrowing has\u00a0a higher stamina cost. While\u00a0burrowing, the mole rat can also move through holes -\u00a0making it possible to trap enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both digging and burrowing dispense stamina. Stamina\u00a0 recharges over time. As previously mentioned, the mole rat can immediately regain a large amount of stamina - and health -by\u00a0eating a worm.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\r\nActionsPC :\u00a0XBOX Gamepad:MoveWASDLeft\u00a0JoystickDigRight-ShiftRight TriggerBurrowSpaceLeft TriggerPick Up\u00a0WormsERight BumperDrop WormFBEatQXExit\u00a0GameEscBack\u00a0ButtonRestartRStart\u00a0Button\r\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming\u00a0:</p>\n<p>@galloping_bull</p>\n\n<p>Art:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T09:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc5c6bc4611faf6221075a89e38359b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["galloping_bull"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
