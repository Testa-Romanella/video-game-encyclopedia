Performance is a bit slow, but the concept gets through.</p>\n\n<p>A game in which you will lose control of the player and visibility as time goes by. The game was uploaded for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam, which had the Theme \"Out of Control\", so we decided to remove controls (by adding delay)\u00a0as time passes by, as well as remove the player's ability to \"see\" the map.\u00a0 This is caused by a Virus that's entering eating your body away.\u00a0\r\nOnce you die, you leave behind a zombified version of yourself that the virus has consumed. This makes it so that every run is a tad different from the prev. one.</p>\n<p>Sounds and Art assets came from\u00a0Open Game Art - We do not take credit for any of those, of course.<br/><br/><strong>Assets</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>http://freesound.org/people/CGEffex/sounds/98341/</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/6-color-dungeon-hero</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/a-platformer-in-the-forest</li><li>https://opengameart.org/content/pixel-river<br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f51129cda55a4062117a12bf89204c7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lrojas94"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
