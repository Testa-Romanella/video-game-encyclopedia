{"id": 537151, "slug": "into-the-night-wongstein", "name": "Into the Night (wongstein)", "name_original": "Into the Night (wongstein)", "description": "<p>Into the Night is a branching narrative RPG set in feudal Japan. You play a fledgling ninja, assigned to spy on two Princesses who are newcomers to Lord Matsuda's castle. When things go sideways you must quickly gain the girls' trust in order to survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a sample of the game's opening interaction- I'd love to hear comments and/or feedback. I'll be porting the game to Unity, as this was written using Ink. While Ink\u00a0is a great tool for pure story-based games, it's not really meant for implementing\u00a0RPG systems like inventory, skills, and battle engines. My next enhancements after the port will be to continue\u00a0the story with the sisters, implement\u00a0battle, skill, and mapping systems, and to add more artwork.\u00a0Let me know if you have any special requests!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T03:20:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c124e962054c04158b257a5287ff9fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wongstein"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
