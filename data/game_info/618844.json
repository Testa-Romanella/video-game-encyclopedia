Careful how you move, they can sense it somehow...<br/><br/>Only by traversing the rift can we regain what was lost. Use the gems you collect wisely: soul gems allow instant passage between worlds, and body gems restore your life. But both will be needed to reconnect the realms and bring harmony once more.</p>\n<p>\n</p><p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Walk: Left &amp; Right Arrow Keys<br/>Jump: Up Arrow Key<br/>Switch Worlds (costs one blue soul gem): Space Bar</p><p><strong>Objective<br/></strong>Activate both the blue and red bridges between realms by collecting at least 2 gems of the bridge's color.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This version is a rough prototype for functional testing.
