Through this game, they have the ability to give themselves a name, a form, and find out information from the deity of time, Kairos. In this first draft, there are 3 end points that players can reach, however, two of them are a secret path only accessible via one choice. My goal for this project is to give players a feeling of powerlessness in the face of insurmountable odds; this is the reason the player is already in between the moments of time from the start of the game. I want players to question who they are and how they got into this situation to begin with. Right now, there is only one passage where players can input there own responses, but I plan to add more in hopes of depraving players of their sense of direction and purpose. Primarily, player choices will consist of dropdowns, several links, and input prompts to progress the story. In this first draft, all three modes of choice are present. I am to have the high level of interactivity ultimately overwhelm the player and give them the sense of being trapped in the moments between time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T06:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75def41443133e0fd8f58d946e3846b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AquaPhoenix101"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
