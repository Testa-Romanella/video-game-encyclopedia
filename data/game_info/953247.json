So the levesl are roughly inspired by missile command, asteroids, luner lander and moon patrol.<br/></p><p>the unmade levels would have taken elements from battle zone and armour attack and some tempest type level.</p><p>procedural routines are used to genrate attack waves and spawn points of player landers as well as the lunar surface and scrolling mountains in the \"moon patrol\" inspired section.</p>At any point, press Right Mouse Button to skip to next stage.\n<p>\r\n            \tStage 1 : simply survice missile barrage. if one missile gets through its all over. Can you survive 10 waves until your ships can launch. left mouse fires interceptor missiles\r\n            </p>\n<p>\r\n            \tStage 2 :Your troop assault carrier is under attack by the enemys defence system. defend it until the engines have power to warp to the enemy homeworld. left mouse fires interceptor missiles\r\n            </p>\n<p>\r\n            \tStage 3 : Land your assault pods on the surface of the enemy homeworld. press SPACE to turn engines on and off to slow below speed of 1 to land safely and also avoid the enemy ground to air missiles.\r\n            </p>\n<p>\r\n            \tStage 4 : drive your troop APC  the 20 clicks to the main enemy position.
