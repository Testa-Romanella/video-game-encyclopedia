Most bugs / issues that are in projects will likely not be fixed or worked on, but I would like it if you would put any issues, you have down in the comments.\u00a0 Also new games / projects will be added in the future. And one last thing thank you to those that I got assets from, all the assets that I use either I created or were free for me to use so thank you for your time in making these assets<br/></p>\n<p>Currently Added:</p>\n<p>Invaders from Space: A 3d space invaders game where the camera is positioned right behind your spacecraft.\u00a0 Shoot down the enemies and don't let them hit you.<br/></p>\n<p>Space Hockey 3D: A 3D physics game where you play air hockey in space against an AI opponent that really isn't that smart.</p>\n<p>Nim: Group Project that we created the game of Nim</p>\n<p>Pente: Group Project that we created the game of Pente</p>\n<p>Casino: Group Project that we created that has multiple different casino games mixed in</p>\n<p>Middara: This is a Middara Tracker for stats and also a dice roller, this was the first time of me using WPF and it isn't good nor a game.
