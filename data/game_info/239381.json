You just need to tap or click on your phone's screen to invite the customer. When you progress in the game, you can upgrade the items to make customer come automatically even when you're idle or away, you can also create your own recipes and sell them, hire employees, make better recipes, so you won't have to tap or click on the screen too often. (You can still tap or click on the screen to fasten your progress of course!)<br/><br/>Note 2: Idle Cafe Tycoon sometimes use \"Idle Game\" or \"Clicker Game\" or \u201cTap Tap\u201d at the end of the name. But we're still the same game, since both idle game and clicker game define the general gameplay of Idle Cafe Tycoon. But don't worry, we can assure you that Idle Cafe Tycoon is more than just a general idle or clicker or tap tap game. Just give it a try! :)<br/><br/>Note 3: Idle Cafe Tycoon (or Idle Cafe Tycoon clicker game) is a free game but does offer in-app purchases of various kinds.<br/><br/>Got problems? Questions?
