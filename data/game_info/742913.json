After many wars, they ended up working together in a peacful way. But many challenges harmed their harmony. You, an 18 years old boy, need to figure out on how to move through and survive in this world.\r\n</p>\n<p>I recommend you to first take the peacful/friendship route, then the violent/mass murder route, then the neutral/ignorant route.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a text-based game (and there will be A LOT of text...at most parts it might be similar to reading a book) where you can choose your actions and go on different routes with different outcome (the choice of route is made at the beginning, however). I hope you'll enjoy the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Any images from the game header aren't likely in the game, as it is a console game.\r\n</p>\n<p>#textadventure #rpg #adventure #retro\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468c30b2ad8de1d306477624932a08d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FaboDevGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
