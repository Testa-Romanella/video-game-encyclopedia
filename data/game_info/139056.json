{"id": 139056, "slug": "shark-shark", "name": "Shark! Shark! (itch)", "name_original": "Shark! Shark! (itch)", "description": "<p><strong>A mixture of a strategy / puzzle game.</strong></p><ul><li> Start out with 12 eggs and 2 sharks. For each level there's one more shark. </li><li>The sharks are going to swim across the screen and your job is to place the eggs out of their way so that they don't eat them. </li><li>The objective is to see how many of the 12 eggs you still have left by the end of level 12.</li><li>Lose all the eggs and it's game over. </li><li> The objects are randomly placed and the sharks swim for an object. So each time you play you're going to see a different route and the objects on different places. </li><li> Because it's random you could get an easy level where all the sharks converge on the same spot or a difficult level where there's really no place they aren't going to swim and you'll need the shop items to protect an egg. </li><li>It's easy to have just one egg left, but if you challenge yourself to have 12 eggs left, you'll find this game engaging.</li></ul><p><strong>Levels: </strong>12</p><p><strong>Difficulty Settings: </strong>3, it determines how much time you have to place your eggs before the sharks arrive and how fast they swim. With a GO button so that you don't have to wait for the timer to run out. Level 1 is relaxed, easy play and you have lots of time, level 3 you have to be quick.</p><p><strong>Time per level: </strong>A few minutes, depending on the level you play and how quick you are. Approximately 2 to 6 minutes per level.</p><p><strong>Music:</strong> 2 different tracks can be switched off.</p><p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Yes, can be turned off. </p><p><strong>Game Saves:</strong> No, it's rather short, it's not necessary.</p><p><strong>Window / Full Screen: </strong>Your choice, select from the menu. Graphics work in both.</p><p>Tested and working on Windows 10.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11a48085de543b0a651992bca01b1fda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evolutionary Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
