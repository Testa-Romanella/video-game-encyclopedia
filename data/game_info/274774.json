Players compete as magical marbles racing and fighting to dominate capture points and collect power ups.<br/><br/><br/>Spin, velocity, bounce, and torque control the players movement with a little added air control for big jumps and falls. Players can pick up to 4 abilities which can be used to throw opponents, save allies or beat enemies out of the capture zone<br/><br/><br/>The environment features different types of interactive and animated elements that can launch, carry, fire, bounce your marble for better or for worse.<br/><br/>Players can get an edge by learning the best routes and experimenting with how their powers can combine with the environment to reach difficult areas or beat opponents out of the capture zone.<br/><br/>The rough road map for Marble Combat will be to go to Steam Early Access with the main map and game mode. Periodically new maps, powers, cosmetics and other game modes will be added throughout early access.<br/><br/>Overall Marble Combat aims to offer a competitive multiplayer with a focus on slapstick comedy and retro nostalgia.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/395/39532df396aab7cf45ca56f008b8b1fc.jpg", "website": "http://www.marblecombat.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 121, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phantom8 Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Phantom8 Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
