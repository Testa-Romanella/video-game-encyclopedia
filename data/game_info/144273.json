What's not to like?</p>\n<p>There is a flash version and a downloadable windows version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The web version controls are standard: arrow keys and your choice of Z, X, C or Space as the fire button.</p>\n<p>With the downloadable version you should be able to play with any gamepad you might have. I\u00a0tested it with an xbox 360 controller (both the left stick and d-pad work) and several random no-name retro controllers. Also in this version -\u00a0Esc exits the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/52475958fd53f91838e41c235cc73f86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["matzieq"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
