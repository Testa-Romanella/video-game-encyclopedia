Crush stupid robots beneath your feet!\u00a0Wield your extra-terrestrial powers in the defence of humanity and send those alien invaders back from whence they came! Do all these things (apart from the last one at the moment) in Yoink!</em></p>\n<p>In Yoink, you play as a part time superheroine who can fly, punch\u00a0<em>really hard</em>\u00a0and throw fireballs. Her job is to protect the little English town where she lives from waves of increasingly tough robots and aliens by\u00a0<em>stomping on them until they explode</em>. Defeated enemies drop objects for bonus points and health replenishment, and you need to dive right into the fray to take advantage of them before they pop out of existence.</p>\r\nHistory\r\n<p>Yoink is a simple game which\u00a0was originally made for the uDevGame contest in 2003. It was put together in three months and needed some hasty last minute compromises to get it done by the deadline! It hasn't changed much since then, so\u00a0it's still very small, with only one arena and a small number of enemies.</p>\n<p>The game hasn't worked for years because it was made so long ago that technology left it behind. It was quite popular at the time, so I've always wanted to fix it up so that people can play it again.</p>\n<p>The original version was Mac-only, but unfortunately this new one currently only runs on Windows!\u00a0I have a new Mac build underway and hope to have that released in a few weeks.</p>\n<p>Read more about Yoink on my website.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec9e74ec72b29246d6627fcedc3f7492.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nether"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
