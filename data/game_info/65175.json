Room of fear", "description": "An ancient cult founded a room of fear, so as not to attract the attention of the state, to use the souls of newly wandering people as victims to their idol. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou decided to go to the horror room. Unaware of the fact that monsters may not be completely disguised people. Realizing that no one is going to let you out, and the phone has lost touch with the world, your only salvation is you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour main task is to survive and understand why these seemingly people are trying to kill you. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game there will not be such an abundance of monsters jumping out of the darkness. But their unimaginable thirst to kill, will haunt you in all corners and secluded places.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeep story: a story that begins hundreds of years before the game begins. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDifferent monsters: each monster has its own character and worries, one at the sight of you rushes to tear you to pieces, and the other will give you a pomuchitsya. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA high level of complexity: you have to pretty well tighten your nerves to get through the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1ff9d1d09a25ffe78142d7933cc50f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 26}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giks"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Giks"], "esrb_rating": null}
