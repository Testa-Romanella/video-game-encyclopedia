{"id": 822039, "slug": "dice-defense-erooelephant", "name": "Dice Defense (ErooElephant)", "name_original": "Dice Defense (ErooElephant)", "description": "<p>A fast paced side scrolling shooter where you get your stats based on the roll of the dice. Throughout the game you can roll the dice to change the enemy stats, which may make things easier or harder. Doing so at low HP may give you one HP back. Destroy 30 enemies to win the game!</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are known bugs with the webgl release, namely that music playback is broken. The windows download is recommended. In addition, the linux download has not been tested.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Move with WASD. Shoot using [Space]. Roll dice using\u00a0[Enter]. Dice can only be rolled after when the indicator in the upper right changes colors (and a sound effect is played). [Escape] will pause the game. A mouse is needed for interacting with UI elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Background planets and stars: https://deep-fold.itch.io/pixel-planet-generator</li><li>Main theme: \"Voxel Revolution\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li><li>Victory theme: \"Getting it Done\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li><li>Lose theme: \"One Sly Move\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</li><li>Main sound effects: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/sci-fi-sounds</li><li>Dice sound effect: \"dieShuffle3.ogg\" from https://www.kenney.nl/assets/casino-audio </li><li>Font: https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font\u00a0</li><li>Framework:\u00a0L\u00d6VE (https://love2d.org/)\u00a0</li><li>Animation library: https://github.com/kikito/anim8</li><li>Build tools: https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove<br/></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Source: https://github.com/ebiederstadt/Dice-Defense</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T13:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f5/9f514cdd108977b52bc4dcc9235237a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ErooElephant"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
