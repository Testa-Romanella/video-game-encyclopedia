It is designed for mobile Virtual Reality, but it works really well on PC. Though it does not yet do virtual reality on this platform, it does bring the bulk of that experience to your home computer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFollowing the story of a group of spirits preforming the funerary rites for a planet, Encompassed engages you with interesting puzzles in 3D space, and culminates in conflict with the wandering and restless dead.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEncompassed borrows from predecessors in other mediums, with an immersive adaptive soundtrack, mysterious levels, and tutorials built into the game which are designed to not break the immersion. It is truly the first great mobile virtual reality atmospheric puzzler (or MVRAP for short ) which you can experience on your own computer, albeit without the VR capability for now.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb5b29df31a4a265abb1d4907a829b84.jpg", "website": "https://dropeverythinggames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drop Everything Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Drop Everything Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
