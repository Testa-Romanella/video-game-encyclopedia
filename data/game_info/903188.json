It combines 3 of the 12 themes from the jam: Restart (Day 3), Stack (Day 4), Time (Day 6). This is a very \"new year\" game. Every year is like another iteration of the time loop. You can't change the past, but you can learn from it and build upon it the next time around.<br/></p><p>Stack and loop until you get bored or reach your desired stack height and get a new high score.
