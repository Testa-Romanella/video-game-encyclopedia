It is a simple runner game with jump and dug to avoid objects<br/></p>\n<p>When I\u00a0wrote this game like always I\u00a0thought of sharing this and it's code. It is part of the Let's Make an Amiga Game Series (LMAG) and it is Volume 2 hence LMAG2. The code is based on that of LMAG.</p>\n<p>You can watch the coding video streams related to this game by clicking\u00a0the link\u00a0here https://tinyurl.com/p101-lmag2\u00a0once they are released\u00a0 (between\u00a0Dec 22 and Jan 23).<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can download the source code for each episode by reading the comments under each of the video. Of course this will only happen when these are released.</p>\n<p>All the info related to the first series (LMAG) you can find here\u00a0https://phaze101.itch.io/mr-poo-journey\u00a0.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn Amiga Assembly from scratch I have another series which is called The Complete Amiga Assembly Course. This goes in detail and you will need to have patience since it starts very slow but as you go along your knowledge will grow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is the link to this series https://tinyurl.com/A68K-ENG</p>\n<p>If you need any help please get in touch with me on Discord that is the best medium for me.
