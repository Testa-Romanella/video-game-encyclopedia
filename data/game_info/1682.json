{"id": 1682, "slug": "the-wolf-among-us", "name": "The Wolf Among Us", "name_original": "The Wolf Among Us", "description": "<p>The Wolf Among Us is a five-part episodic game relying heavily on dialogues and choices of the player. The game is considered a prequel to Bill Willingham&#39;s &#39;Fables&#39; comic book and features usual TellTale stylistics: cartoon-like graphics, comparing your choices to the decisions of the other players and QTEs. &#39;The Wolf&#39; is the first part of the series with a promised expansion to the second season coming out in 2019.<br />\nYou play as Bigby Wolf; he is a Sheriff of a Fabletown: as a typical Sheriff, you need to fulfill the requests of the Fabletown&#39;s residents and uncover mysteries lying behind the crimes there. The gameplay consists of choosing the dialogue options, reacting to QTE button-mash and watching cutscenes. <br />\nThe critics are marking down that unlike many other TellTale games &#39;The Wolf Among Us&#39; borrows original comic book&#39;s portrayal thus looking better, and having the original as sequel before you eyes lets you engage with Fabula more quickly.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2013-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:15:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/be0/be084b850302abe81675bc4ffc08a0d0.jpg", "website": "http://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus", "rating": 4.4, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 366, "owned": 4303, "beaten": 2191, "toplay": 251, "dropped": 197, "playing": 48}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 320, "ratings_count": 2053, "suggestions_count": 554, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 2074, "platforms": ["PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "iOS", "PC", "Android", "Xbox 360", "macOS"], "developers": ["Telltale Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Telltale Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
