Guided by The Optimist, you set out on a biking adventure full of joy and happiness! Will you continue in sheer joy, or fall into the sarcasm of The Pessimist? With multiple endings over 8+ routes, you can explore various scenarios and snarky comments between the narrators.</p>\n<p>The project isn't complete at this point. This is just the first stage and still a bit buggy. But we're still proud of the work we put into it.\u00a0 We plan on completing this game in its entirety soon.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Lead Developer: Trevin Pointer</li>\n<li>Level Design: Joseph Owens &amp; Trevin Pointer</li>\n<li>Scripting: Anthony Palmer &amp; Joseph Owens</li>\n<li>The Optimist: Anthony Palmer</li>\n<li>The Pessimist: Joseph Owens</li>\n<li>Sound Development: Anthony Palmer</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/81606375579f4f256c7cb49d6f518534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["boxinabox", "SirBaconBitz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
