{"id": 952735, "slug": "wish-guardian", "name": "Wish Guardian", "name_original": "Wish Guardian", "description": "<p>As far as everyone is concerned, you\u2019re an average farmer, only going into the mines to scavenge for new mushroom species. <br/></p>\n<p>In reality?\u00a0  </p>\n<p>You're using those mushrooms to craft offensive, defensive, and tool  cards\u00a0to defeat the wraiths that reside in the mountain and protect your  community. <br/></p>\r\nFarm!\r\n\r\nBefriend!\r\n\r\nFight!\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wish Guardian is a cozy RPG with a purpose.\u00a0</strong> </p>\n<p>That purpose? Protect your village from the wraiths turned evil from an errant wish by  your own grandfather.  </p>\n<p>By combining farming sim role playing mechanics and deck builder, the  player can dig further and further into the mysteries and enemies  within the abandoned mines of Mushroom Mountain. After your work is  finished within the mines, players can grow and harvest a variety of  magic-infused crops, forage for materials, and make friends with the  unique array of villagers of Rekanite Ridge. Will you say hi to the  grumpy, cursed cook of the local inn, Blue, or do your best to make  smalltalk with the paranoid family of preppers, forever convinced the  second extinction war is on the horizon? The choice is yours.  </p>\n<p>Wish Guardian is currently under development for its free to play  demo, and will be constantly updating. Obviously, this is  not the final iteration of the game, just a proof of concept to get  feedback.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0Like any developing game, all assets and game balancing is up to  change as our team makes progress.

If you over-harvest, go follow the train tracks and you can find more crops. </li><li>The tutorial does not save, so you must complete it all in one go. If you do not, it will simply start as if you have completed the tutorial.</li></ul></li></ul>\r\nMore Info\r\n<p>Our team:\u00a0\u00a0https://wishguardianpress.carrd.co/#aboutus  </p>\n<p>Our game/story:\u00a0https://wishguardian.carrd.co/  </p>\n<p>Contact Information:\u00a0https://wishguardian.carrd.co/#contactus \r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T10:18:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de7b94182b1a3961440052034b31b62b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wishstone Productions"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
