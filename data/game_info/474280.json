It is\u00a0challenging because of its special hexagonal shape in which you will easily lose your sense of direction of the North, South, West, and East.\u00a0 Moreover, you can see in the blue map\u00a0those tricky loops and external lines I designed to misdirect you into other area.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I made this maze simpler by implementing a minimap so that you can use the trophy as a reference point to locate where you are in the map. However, if you intend to try what it will feel like in real life, you can press \"M\" to disable the minimap or wait till the second completion since the game will automatically disable it for you.</p>\n\r\n Some interesting facts \r\n<p>This is a honeycomb maze design in real life.</p>\n\n<p>in a TV Show, someone actually challenges this maze, <strong>blindfolded</strong>, and successfully escaped, which was so shocking to me that inspires me to create this game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This game is made with Unity, hope you will like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/609b0e674fcb10092ccb6c9900a31410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timiport"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
