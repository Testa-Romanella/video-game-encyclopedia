It is not in anyway a \"game\"\u00a0or \"fun\" or even \"worthwhile for the player.\" I\u00a0did learn a lot, and will continue to poke at this rudimentary game to learn a few more things about these topics. It's been fun to do, even if the product currently is not fun.<br/><br/>You'll need to load this into an emulator to move Glube around a single-screen playfield. That's all you can do! That's it.<br/><br/>You can move Glube around! Imagine that money or objects appear that you must pickup before being spotted by the roving security team. Imagine the $ value increasing as you pick up each item.\u00a0<em>Imagine!<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T12:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d57/d57327b4a7c28633bfd3c292e65cfd29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["whogas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
