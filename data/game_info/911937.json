Unfortunaltely the hars weather conditions made them loose their equipment and\u00a0killed all of them, excpet one. You managed to sneak into the complex unnoticed. Now it's up to you to find the means to destroy\u00a0The Supreme AI.</p>\n<p>Search for a working floppydisk, assemble a disk drive, and collect malicious files to directly upload into The Supreme AI. Watch out, there are robots and drones that will try to catch you. Any unusable junk can be thrown to create some distraction until you sneak past the guards.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>You can move left and right, climb ladders and operate lifts up and down. Up to activate lift buttons and search for items. Press and hold fire to see the throwable junk flypath, release to throw. It will create a diversion for a couple of seconds.</p>\n<p>Keyboard: W A S D or arrow keys (move, operate, search), SPACE, CTRL (throw)<br/></p>\n<p>Gamepad: Dpad up down left right (move, operate, search),\u00a0A (throw)</p>\n<p>The game has a simple menu: ESCAPE or gamepad select, and then again, to exit to title screen. Use F7 F8 to set sound volume, and F9 F10\u00a0 to set music volume.</p>\n<p>The game has around an hour of gameplay, more if you get lost. I suggest to make note of the terminals whereabouts, as they give files only if you have a working floppy.</p>\n<p>Have fun! :)</p><p>If you feel lost, try to find yourself on the map I uploaded as screenshot. (I may make a minimap system for the game at some point)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T08:57:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c209d531ac115c9261ebee3b8ee5db8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LtCoyote"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
