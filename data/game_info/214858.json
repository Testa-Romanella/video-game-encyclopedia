With one player holding on, the other can swing to dodge incoming icicles and increase in height. Use this mechanic to ensure that your partner survives; without a pivot point, you\u2019ll have a far tougher time of dodging those icicles yourself (or maybe you\u2019re just a nice person!). That said, only the first player to reach the top of the mountain will be victorious!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>BOBBLEHAT PRODUCTIONS\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p>Jeremy Sapsed \u2013 Programming\r\n  </p>\n<p>Benji Thomas \u2013 Visuals\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robert Ashby \u2013 Bits of both! <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES USED </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Font - https://www.dafont.com/tiza.font\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music - \"I Can Feel it Coming\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) - Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\n  </p>\n<p>Wind - https://opengameart.org/content/strong-wind-blowing\r\n  </p>\n<p>Wilhelm Scream - http://www.orangefreesounds.com/wilhelm-scream/\r\n  </p>\n<p>Icicle impact - https://freesound.org/people/Julien%20Nicolas/sounds/133783/\r\n  </p>\n<p>Rope - https://freesound.org/people/6polnic/sounds/231438/\r\n  </p>\n<p>All of which are creative commons/free to use, to our knowledge!\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/431/4311d0a413ae65884ea0c9ab7fa341c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RoboPenguin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
