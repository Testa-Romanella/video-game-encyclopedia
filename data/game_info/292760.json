But a great war destroyed not only human, but the planet itself. In these sad times, only a woman, The Last Alchemist, can save the nature from a certain extinction.</p>\r\nUse your keyboard to interact with the power between her hands to save fauna and flora from. Mother nature needs you!\r\n<p>Many of the animation were made on\u00a0<strong>Photoshop</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>After Effects</strong>\u00a0for the main character.<br/>For the game design we used\u00a0<strong>Unity</strong>.<br/>And sadly, the time was running out and we didn't make any sound design.</p>\n<p>This was our very first game jam, and for two of us the first time we worked on a videogame. A lot have been accomplished! Unfortunately, and because of a lack of organisation and a way too ambitions project, we had to make a lot of concessions. The game surely will have been better if we knew how to deal with our own competences and technical options, but we are still very happy to participate.</p>\n<p>It was a real exhausting weekend, but in the end we'll look forward to try another jam!<br/>Good luck to all the participants!</p>\n<p>Damien, David, Leandre &amp; Lara</p>\n<p><em>So sorry for our english, we french are just so bad to communicate in others languages</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T04:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/184/184c3c110f917f5fbdee98964f779e8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeandreRenouard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
