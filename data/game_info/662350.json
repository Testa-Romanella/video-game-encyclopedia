Chill out and relax as you rip rent out of little cartoon people's pockets. Upgrades help you along the way by giving your houses little buffs and gimmicks, like taking rent out of the people's pockets even faster! Upgrades come in different rarities and they get harder to find as the rarity increases, so if you get your hands on an exotic you should be happy! I didn't even mention the Unreal ones...<h3>Gameplay</h3>So what can you do in <strong>Passive Income</strong>? This idle-ish simulator game brings you options to build different buildings, including houses, villas, mansions, and more! These buildings bring you money to buy either more buildings, upgrades, or the untested rebirthing, test at your own risk! As you gain more money more options will become available to you including new worlds, new upgrades, and new buildings to be built! These new upgrades and worlds will help you along the way to becoming the richest player!
