{"id": 552932, "slug": "singstar-rocks", "name": "Singstar Rocks!", "name_original": "Singstar Rocks!", "description": "<p>Konami&#39;s Karaoke Revolution finally has stateside competition in SingStar Rocks!, a new PlayStation 2 karaoke game developed by Sony&#39;s London studio. SingStar is a prolific series in Europe--entries are available with subtitles like Party, Anthems, &#39;80s, and more--but Rocks! marks the first time the franchise has appeared in the US. It contains a reasonably satisfying song lineup and is geared more toward the multiplayer party scenario than dedicated, career-based single-player singing. For your money, you also get a pair of pretty good microphones and a USB adapter that lets them interface with the PS2. The game is a little short on game modes and other frills, and diehard karaoke fans will likely find that the game lacks staying power, but SingStar Rocks! serves nicely as a casual singing-based game for those less discriminating songsters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-04T18:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3197a43d8bc1fc8f276ca42c75c23c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["SCEE London Studio"], "genres": ["Family"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
