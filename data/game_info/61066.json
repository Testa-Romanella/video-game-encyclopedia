Travel the galaxy as a mercenary with a fluffy dragon alongside a cast of endearing characters.<br/><br/>This game is a 2d action platformer with a retro-SNES vibe about it - so expect solid, tight controls with a slower movement speed for clarity of gameplay. I do tip my hand early and give good powerups early in the game - so expect to be traveling on the ceiling and one-shoting enemies once you get into the meat of the game.<br/><br/>Alongside the mechanics is a cast of characters that I really want to stand out - from a talking cat wizard to a skeleton in a kimono, you'll meet interesting tropes of NPCs, but then shortly after they will begin to surprise and grow on you - just like real people do. This is a huge focus for me personally that I strive for - a cast to remember.<br/><br/><strong>So, in short -</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>A short game - currently about 20-25 minutes of gameplay<br/></li><li>Tight controls and movement<br/></li><li>Great characters to love (or hate!)<br/></li><li>Fluffy dragon you can pet as much as you want</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31b8f21f4267bdb610e25bd9fcbf7d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dragonGlitch Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["dragonGlitch Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
