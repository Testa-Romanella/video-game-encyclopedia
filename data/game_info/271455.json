The red tanks can vary in strength, but for you it's two strikes and your out. You might find your tank isn't strong enough, so what you can do is sacrifice your tank's controls (weapons or movement) for a speed or attack boost.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the main mode, you need to survive five levels including a boss. Destroying 20 tanks will progress you to the next level. In endless mode, there is no boss, so you go on until you are destroyed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55fed344b00b47e22429669578a6378d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
