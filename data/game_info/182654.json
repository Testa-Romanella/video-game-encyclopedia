Shoot particles with the left mouse button. Depending on where the particle is, it will have a different type of motion. Hold space while in a simulation to bring up the properties menu. While in the properties menu you can change the motion and rate of change of particles. The properties menu will also allow you to change visual effects, such as mesh and trails. Certain combinations of motion will yield interesting results... See if you can find them...</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Made with GameMaker: Studio 1.4<br/>Sounds made with sfxr<br/>Music made with Rytmik Ultimate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59dc88789c1c56f23c25c2b1cfe2fed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Walrusboy99"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
