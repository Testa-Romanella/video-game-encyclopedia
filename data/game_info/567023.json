What a shame that would be, not publishing finished games. I mean, who does that?<br/><br/><ul><li>What do you get when you have more than a man and more than a king? You get a KING MAN! But not any King Many, no, you get a SUPER KING MAN! And trust me, if you think that makes no sense, you better prepare for even more nonsense. Because that's what SUPER KING MAN is all about: Nonsense!<br/></li><li>Donald the orange onion is furious, because he kinda sorta lost the election, somehow. So he decides to take matters into his own hands and find the 270 votes he needs to win himself. Well, not himself, you will find it, by exploring a metroid-vania ish land and defeating the bad hombres - the blue ones, that is - by doing it the Don style: Waltzing all over them. And that's the gist of DONION ON ELECTION DAY! Too political?<br/></li><li>When the Orangutan in chief tells his construction workers to build a skyscraper, the best, biggest and bestest skyscraper (he has all the best words) on an island somewhere (and the island is going to pay for it) it is up to YOU, as the monkey who has to oversee construction, to head to that island and check out the best spot for that skyscraper in this stage based metroidvania-ish platformer called MONKEY KONG ISLAND.</li></ul><br/>And there you have it! Three games for the price of one - and these aren't minigames either, they are fully fledged games with content and graphics and stuff. But no politics! I am a completely apolitical developer, so if you interpret any politics into this, let me tell you, it is not! KING MAN! SUPER!<br/><br/>Have a list of arbitrary features:<br/><ul><li>Three retro-styled platformers in one collection<br/></li><li>Pure platforming, simple metroidvania and something in between<br/></li><li>Featuring real voice acting, partially, some of it, maybe<br/></li><li>Silly humor, really, REALLY pointless nonsense<br/></li><li>I ran out of things to make fun about</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T02:23:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/333ec78e50685cd86ff19678fc34961f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spike", "Ezekiel Rage"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
