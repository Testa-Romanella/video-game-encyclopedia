Symbolizing the give-and-take relationship humans have with the natural world, users move a mystical character through forest, grasslands and tundra in search of poetic tokens dotting the landscape. When activated, they reveal words hidden in the wind, breathing new life into the nearby flora and fauna. Flowers grow at the character\u2019s feet, leaves bloom on the bare trees, birds and butterflies emerge. As the user continues on their journey, these uncovered words combine into verse, expressing our eternal need to capture nature\u2019s fleeting moments in poetry.<br />\nEach experience of WAYFINDER is as unique and ephemeral as the natural world itself. The visual assets are assembled procedurally and delivered in real-time. The lines of poetry are created with a mix of artificial intelligence, machine learning and generative processes, providing thousands of possible combinations. As such, Wayfinder is an ever-changing, emergent artwork with infinite possibilities.<br />\nBlurring the line between video game, animated short and interactive poem, WAYFINDER is produced by the NFB and the latest project by artist and creative coder Matt DesLauriers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Compatibility issues might occur on older iPad devices updated to OS 15.1.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T05:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19f/19f695fe53a195097da7b94c27dc3505.jpg", "website": "https://www.nfb.ca/interactive/wayfinder", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Airship Syndicate", "National Film Board of Canada \u2013 Office national du film du Canada"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Digital Extremes"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
