This is inspired by Brackey's Game Jam 2022.1 them \"It is not real\" and the conspiracy of pigeons not being real and are actually drones working for the government.<br/><br/>The game is aimed to be an open world/city adventure that progresses the player through a story of missions as a bird who must remain stealthy and observe at a distance. I took this game jam to play a lot more with Cinemachine and moving the camera around. I'd love to continue working on this game outside of the scope of the jam, and incorporate more complexity and puzzles to the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:04:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f07/f0731adfda2a27d4fdcf22dc7519b0c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jonan"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
