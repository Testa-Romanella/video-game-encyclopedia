The theme was \"Out Of Control\". This is my approach.</p>\n<p>This game is a short platformer where the incapability to jump leds you to using a grappling hook to move vertically.\u00a0But oh no! Some guy gave you a defective one that is very difficult to aim, and also can explode randomly. What a shame, it is what it is.</p>\n<p>In \"<em>You Can(not) Escape</em>\", the crosshair used for aiming the hook shot is moving randomly over the screen, and also, every shot of said hook reduces your chances of surviving, that is, that you don't explode. Taking away things that the player uses to have was my take on the jam's theme.</p>\n<p>These are the controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys,\u00a0 or A/D -- Move horizontally.</li><li>Space Bar -- Start aiming and shoot.</li></ul>\n<p>The battery on the top-left corner represents your chances of surviving the next shot.</p>\n\n<p>To whoever reads this, feedback is really appreciated. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faab29d8004447d9082ea5dfec0640a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HiddNSpace"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
