The game gets increasingly difficult as the waves of pirates get bigger and bigger!</p>\n<p>Castle Defender VR was developed by several SideFX game interns to explore how Houdini can be used to create procedural assets for VR games. The team of interns built everything inside Houdini, including the characters and animations, and then used Houdini Engine to bring the procedural assets into the Unity game engine. This procedural workflow allowed them to easily use and modify the assets in Unity with maximum control and speed.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the development of Castle Defender VR, watch the videos on this page:\u00a0https://www.sidefx.com/community/castle-defender-vr-released-for-htc-vive/</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Game Design &amp; Programming - Gabriel Valdivia, Viviana Mora</p>\n<p>Art &amp; Animation - Gabriel Valdivia, Joshua Aoki, Som Goswami</p>\n<p>Project Advisors - Rob Stauffer, Ben Mears, Judith Crow, Luiz Kruel, Damian Campeanu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/2598d5d556ceb7105a71179fd6e226ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SideFX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
