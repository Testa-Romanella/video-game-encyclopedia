The folks complained and protested but the military moved right on in regardless. The folks calmed down over time but before long, the quarry was flooded. The new lake became a popular spot for fishing and recreation. That was before she rose up from below. Within 24 hours, Springcreek was empty. No one, no folks, no militants, no nothing. Nobody.</p><p>This is where you come in, Grab a flashlight, search for the clues around the town, find out whatever you can.. this extends way beyond the norms of reality..</p><p>Good luck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60b/60b8a1d2dc56a5647b3ac145d39472f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trias1995"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
