This topic was chosen because a lot of research has shown that mental arithmetic is a big problem among younger learners.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The positive features of my game include:\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Mental arithmetic becomes more difficult as the learner progresses;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- The game is colourful and keeps the learner's attention using the colour;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- Learners are remunerated through the allocation of marks;\r\n  </p>\n<p>- The main account sums are never the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Modding is supported!!!</strong></p>\n<p>You can edit the images of the game as you like, zip them into a folder and publish it as a mod.</p>\n<p>If you screw up and did not make a back up copy, you can download the official\u00a0Restoration\u00a0pack with all the back up images you need for the game<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Important note!</p>\n<p>This was my school project for the year so do not expect anything amazing, but you probably won't. I do think this game helps with math problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future Updates:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n1.
