It had to be trimmed down due to time, so now it is a parkour collection level. I wanted to really play with using emissive textures and lighting in unreal, so I spent a lot of time working on the emissive mushrooms and crystals.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/52478bfa4c1f6feb82bdbba3f4882fad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ErinMayBeMildlyCreative"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
