A number of video games have used this technique to widen their content variety and replay value in aspects such as level generation or randomized loot. This project aims to study procedural generation in two aspects: <br/></p>\n<p>Firstly, it analyses how it can help making Non-Player Characters (NPC) feel more unique by developing a generator that creates characters with enough complexity to develop engaging relationships with the player. If successful, this project could show a potential way to add interesting characters into a video game while reducing the costs of manually having to detail all aspects of their personality and characteristics. <br/></p>\n<p>Secondly, this project also aims to evaluate how modular procedural narrative can be affected by such generated NPCs, modifying its content depending on their dynamic characteristics. The analysis on how player interaction with these procedural narrative events is received could give insight on future implementations of rich and replayable stories in video games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T08:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30d/30d51b9d88a73c6928de897baa684e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miquel Sans Cornet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
