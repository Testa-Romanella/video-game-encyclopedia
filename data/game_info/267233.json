Players also care for their farm animals: milking their cows and collecting eggs from their chickens.</p>\n<p>FarmVille was the top game by daily active users on Facebook between August 2009 and December 2010, when CityVille claimed the top spot. We continue to enhance the social aspects of the game, including in-game gifting to friends, cooperative crafting jobs and trading goods in the farmer\u2019s market. In March 2011, we released FarmVille English Countryside, which provides players the opportunity to create a second farm styled after an English country farm.</p>\n<p>In our first retail tie-in in May 2010, we partnered with 7-Eleven to offer FarmVille-branded game cards and items on many of the convenience retailer\u2019s products, including Slurpee and Big Gulp drinks in nearly 7,000 stores. We partnered with Lady Gaga in May 2011 by creating GagaVille \u2014 a Lady Gaga-inspired farm where players could visit and listen to songs from her album Born This Way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e5/3e54d015dc464100d826dacd8d6e3c78.jpg", "website": "https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville/", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 10}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Zynga"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Zynga"], "esrb_rating": null}
