Ants search the screen for the food (green squares), bring food back to the nest (black square). Once ten pieces of food is brought back to the nest a new ant is spawned. The ants leave trails behind them that fade over time. The ants can follow the trails back to the food once it is found.</p><p>Note that there are some bugs having to do with following the trails.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c50/c501ec7be034de451185279ecc56e131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AllManyLots"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
