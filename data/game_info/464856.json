A burnt house can be burnt again. The fire follows Connway's game of life:</p><ul><li>Any fire with fewer than two neighbouring fires goes out</li><li>Any fire with two or three neighbours stays</li><li>Any fire with more than three neighbours goes out</li><li>Any cell with three live neighbouring fires\u00a0catches fire</li></ul><p>I didn't have time to make levels introduce ideas gradually so if you are stuck\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life contains all the patterns you need to beet the game.
