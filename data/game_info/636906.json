Humanity enslaved robots, they made them do whatever they wanted. At this point, the biggest factor was that the robots were programmed to listen to their owners and obey whatever they were told. One day, a robot with emotions was charged by its owner to kill a human. The robot had to submit to whatever its destiny was, because that's how it was created.</p>\n<p>After killing the human, he was taken to the robots prison. Here the robots were fighting with humans in the arena, the winning robots were released and the losers were left to rust in the prison. When the emotional robot was rejected by its owner, it was able to use its own will. He didn't want to hurt people and refused arena fights. One day, when the guard robot entered his room in the prison to kill him, the guard's gun malfunctioned and destroyed the guard.</p>\n<p>The robot could have escaped from the prison using this weapon, but the weapon's system was malfunctioning and half of its shots were breaking the weapon's system. The robot took this risk and did its best.</p>\n<p>When he pulled the trigger to silently destroy a guard in the last room, the malfunction in the gun had also broken his own system and self-destructed. His last words as he said he didn't deserve to die were: \"It's not my own choices that made me this way, it's my destiny that forced me to live this, and it's a <em><strong>fault of the system</strong></em> that is destiny itself.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T12:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5e213057028c946712d2e49e3df3ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oguzhankalkuz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
