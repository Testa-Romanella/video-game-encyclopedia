{"id": 594093, "slug": "serotopia", "name": "Serotopia", "name_original": "Serotopia", "description": "<p>Emmet and his twin brother Elliot were inseparable from the moment they were brought into this world. They loved puzzles, painting, and most of all going on magical adventures with one another. \r\n  </p>\n<p>One day, Emmet became ill and started spending a lot of time at the hospital. Elliot could not understand why his brother could no longer be with him or why he could not be at his side. His mother, to ease Elliot\u2019s despair, brought him a doll and told him that this doll would keep him company till his brother came back from the hospital. It is a magical doll from one to their adventures that Emmet sent as a substitute while he is not there.\u00a0 \r\n  </p>\n<p>Elliot, overjoyed, immediately takes a liking to his new friend and he begins to play again. Suddenly, his brother\u2019s health starts to decline leaving him in a comatose state. Elliot is left alone to weep in his solitude. In his grievance with his doll, he stumbles across an old book that he and his brother once used to act out casting spells while on one of their many pretend journeys. \r\n  </p>\n<p>With much resolve, he seized his enchanted gloves, safely stored after their last adventure. Elliot, following the guidelines of the tome, places the right glove on his doll\u2019s hand while fastening the left on his own. Elliot begins to recite an incantation and casts \u201cAdventure\u201d. The room slowly begins to fade into obscurity and is transported into a realm void of color and life.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Elliot awakens as the doll and realizes that he has been transported to a new realm. He glances back and sees an orb and realizes that this is his connection to Elliot. He looks down and realizes that his hand with the glove has a glowing prismatic gem that seems to be infused with magic. The doll stretches out his hand and begins to paint this monochromatic world that he has fallen into.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90ff8f03f7f7f12f4bdc201b6ead4ef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TMOP"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
