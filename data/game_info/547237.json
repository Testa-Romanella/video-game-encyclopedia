The theme was \"Everything is Broken\".\u00a0The idea was to create a game focused around a broken down ship, where you have to slowly \"wake\" personnel and bring systems online in order to fix up the ship before you were overtaken by Space Pirates.\u00a0There isn't much inside the game to tell you this because I ran short on time but I hope you get the gist!<br/></p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>This is a deck/engine-building game, where you accumulate cards in order to increase your fuel enough to \"get outta here\". Fuel slowly decreases over time, but there are cards you can play to increase your \"energy\" in order to ultimately buy more fuel. Be careful though, if you don't build a balanced deck it can be real hard to \"get outta here\" before the pirates arrive!</p>\r\nThank you!\r\n<p>Huge thank you to columferry and dsqrt4 for all the help building this project, and everybody that helped me over on Twitch. There was no way I would have gotten through this without you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-25T07:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b9/7b9b74f0c2e410650798e8f5fbfb6ab3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THEjoezack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
