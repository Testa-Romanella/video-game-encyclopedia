This theme was very difficult for me, because i did not came up with an idea anytime soon. Finally i got something i do enjoy: **Reindeer Runners**.</p>\n<p>In Reindeer Runners you control a lot of reindeers with cute reindeer names :smile: who are following the alpha reindeer. But watch out for traps or other obstacles they've got to avoid! The **first character** of their name **indicates the key** you got to press in the right moment.</p>\n<p>Every now and then another reindeer joins the reindeer herd. The more reindeers the more fun :smile: The more stages you master, the harder it gets.</p>\n<p>You can return to the main menu by pressing the escape key at any time during the run.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf883d1c5e78cd142b5a2bf0c841ebe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarinWin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
