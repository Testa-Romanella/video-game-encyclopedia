Swap fruit around to match all the required fruit before the time runs out. The direction you swap determines the direction your fruit shuffles (so think carefully sometimes). Set up nice little chain reactions and gain big points every time. Pick up multipliers and look for the golden cherries.<br/>If you can't swap, or don't want do, then use the Mix It button to shake things up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f57/f57d4cdec35e62ba7c2233f2a8b2e0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thigydaze"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
