Play as Brie, a spunky pink haired girl who recently gained the ability to magically summon cheese sandwiches out of thin air. Everyone thinks Brie's magical girl powers are a joke, but the Magical Response Unit is in desperate need of her help.</p>\n<p>The game features an in-depth time management system. Brie has four stats that contribute to her morale, and you'll need to make sure she eats right and has plenty of leisure time if you want to perform well in combat.
