The game features traditional platforming aspects, with the addition of a distorted world layout that is certain to disorient the player. Three brothers under ill fate stumble upon a stone idol in the forest and unwittingly unleash a sealed evil upon the world; the demon overlord steals the childrens' souls for their curiosity, rendering them as lifeless stone heads. The player must navigate through the demons vision and reclaim their souls.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't have a 1080p resolution the menu controls will not work and you can proceed by pressing enter or space. You can use 'S' to skip the intro story. If you die the game quits, that isn't a bug. Only the fullscreen option was implemented. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:54:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21f2e9def965eea0c40c75d6345b1fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimmuDesu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
