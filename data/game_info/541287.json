You will be exploring a large winter city looking for food, saving yourself from cold and wind at a fire, and searching for safe shelters at night so that you may survive as long as you can. You have to constantly monitor your body temperature so that you don\u2019t die because of the cold. To keep it high enough, you can find a warm shelter or make a fire. To recover your energy, you need to sleep. But it\u2019s even colder at night, so you will have to find a warm shelter with no wind getting inside.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T02:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6def880859e91a76abda90c6d2ef2b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BisquitPlay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BisquitPlay"], "esrb_rating": null}
