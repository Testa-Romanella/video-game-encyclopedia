The whole thing has been coded in DarkBasic Professional.  As such, I have encountered some errors in running the game on some PC's, but for the most part, it works.  Just be aware.  As far as the game is concerned, it's a text-based puzzle game made to toy with the player's head.  I hope you enjoy it, and please, leave any feedback you may have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b3de112f95cc1ef89282265701f2b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MuyMachoGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
