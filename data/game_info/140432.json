You might notice some similarity to other pin throwing games. Rest assured, PINCUSHION is as unique as you are!</p><p>In PINCUSHION, your job is to stick all of your pins in the unsuspecting, spinning pincushion in the center of the screen. It's a lot harder than it looks! There are 50 levels of varying difficulty to master, and a variety of pins that each have their own unique effects. Figuring out what each pin does - and timing your pins - is crucial to success in PINCUSHION. And if you can complete all 50 levels, then I will gladly admit that you are an expert pin-sticker. Maybe that'll translate into success for you later in life.</p><p>PINCUSHION also features time-based leaderboards for each level. Do you have what it takes to beat the times of every single player in the world?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f68d6f42e0e7e11fb6e7786fc0faf5f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sandcastle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
