This game will also be apart of the 100+ track album I will be releasing with this game that will essentially be included in the full version of this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With 2 games relatively in the same universe, this will also help me evolve the story and dynamic with new characters as I start to complete next episode once these are finished and up. I am seeking feedback and many play testers as I am constantly combing over this game and finding bugs and inconsistencies  that could be sought out and fixed.</p>\n<p>Subscribe to my Youtube page for some video's of play-throughs of what I have so far with more to come. I have <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> to implement but things are going pretty smoothly! I've also nearly hit all 999 of my available switches in Smile Game Builder so the ending of this game is encroaching closer that I thought.</p>\n<p>If you like what you played,  a dollar or $2 would help me purchase a some streaming equipment if any are curious how I make content. Hopefully soon I can fund this myself :) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9b/c9b6b96adef7092be13d8cda132c0f88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ParadoxERMedia"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
