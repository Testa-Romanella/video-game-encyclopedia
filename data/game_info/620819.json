This was originally designed for two players but upon testing, I'm doubtful that there is a pair of people that could be <em>that</em> co-oridinated. So play alone, play with a friend, both works.</p>\n<p>The music was made by me a while ago and the SFX were made using BFXR.<br/></p>\n<p>The Mac version <em>should </em> work for both Intel and Silicon based Macs. I don't own either however so I can't guarrantee it works on any Mac.<br/></p>\n\n<p>i promise i'm better at unity than photoshop, plz play game<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/003/003455de130adc9462c750dce3888ceb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tea_and_digestives"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
