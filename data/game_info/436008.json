As the shaman of your village, it is your duty to heal him!<br/>Go inside its body and use your power to heal him, but be careful about the macrobias and the lymphocytes that can kill you!</p>\n<p>The Ill Divinity is a platformer game where you have to finish each screen before the divinity dies. If you stay idle, you can use a healing aura that will heal it and make you earn some time. It also neutralized macrobias for a few seconds. But be careful, it boosts lymphocytes!</p>\n<p>This is my third participation in compo and, even though this game is a bit unfinished, I am pretty proud of it.
