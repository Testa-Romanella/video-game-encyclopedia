I did not have very much time to play test what was submitted. I spent a long time on pixels and playing around with math to create different kinds\u00a0of movement, but never got around to fleshing out an actual game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nKNOWN ISSUES\r\n<ul><li>Game will eventually crash after a certain distance is traveled.</li><li>The RNG on the \"upgrades\" spawn rate is all over the place. Some games you will have no issues getting and staying powered up. Other games, you will travel quite a distance with the default weapon.</li><li>Some enemies had their HP lowered for testing and I forgot to increase it back. This means they die much sooner than they should. Ultimately, this is just a small part of an overall issues with enemy balance - which ultimately stems from lack of play testing.</li><li>There is a reason these types of shooters use predetermined patterns and layouts - they just aren't as fun when they're procedural/random. At least not with the code I came up with.</li><li>Music doesn't seem to play for when a \"boss\" appears. And it was really good music too.\u00a0</li><li>There is a issue with one of the \"boss\" behaviors,\u00a0but I can't remember off the top of my head and haven't had a chance to play long enough to discover it again. Similar with two of the enemies. I remembered spotting incorrect behavior issues but can't recall the specifics at this time.</li><li>The bomb doesn't always work the way it was intended.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nKeyActionArrowsMove\r\nZFireXBombENTERPause/StartEscQuit (from Pause screen)F1Cycle window scaleF2Cycle color palettesMMute\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Pixels, code, and sound effects created in ~1 week by Jason Kimbel\u00a0for GBJAM 6, Aug. 2018.</p>\n<p>Music fantastically crafted by\u00a0Mark Sparling.</p>\n<p>Made in Game Maker Studio 1.4.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3adee09458a8c5dd30bcb30b08dcd02e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anarbitrarymustache"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
