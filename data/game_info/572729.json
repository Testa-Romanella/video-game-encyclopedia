{"id": 572729, "slug": "calcium-crawlers", "name": "Calcium Crawlers", "name_original": "Calcium Crawlers", "description": "<p><em>Calcium Crawlers</em> is a turn-based dungeon crawler with randomly generated dungeons, drawing inspiration from games such as the Advance Wars series, the Nintendo DS Mario &amp; Luigi RPGs and Final Fantasy XIII.</p>\n\n<p>Each turn, characters may:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>Move around within their movement radius;</li><li>Add a maximum of 5 abilities to their queue;</li><li>Execute all abilities in order. By pressing the right button and releasing it at the right time, an ability's performance is determined; more precise timing is rewarded with higher damage output. The longer you wait with pressing a button though, the more time the enemy has to anticipate your attack and block it.<br/><br/>When on the receiving end of an attack, you may press the right button at the right time to block some, or even dodge all, of the damage you'd have taken. </li></ol>\n<p>Furthermore, you are free to access your inventory and customise your loadout at any time before adding abilities to your queue. Items may be discarded to increase your character's speed/initiative. However, consumables such as bonemeal and\u00a0soy milk cost a full turn to use.<br/></p>\n<p>Last but not least, chests may be destroyed in order to loot their contents.</p>\n\n<p>To win, defeat all red skeletons. To lose, have your party leader (\"You\") killed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T07:23:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66f/66fb4ef301730e0e4086bd061c1c0664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daniel Meyer"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
