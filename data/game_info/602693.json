Both sides of this gameplay equation must work together to achieve the ultimate goal:\u00a0complete, print and deliver \u201cQuarterly Reports\u201d\u00a0to your manager at Big Corporation Inc.</p>\n<p>One person on the team is given the role of\u00a0Team Leader\u00a0and can freely explore the office space where the test takes place, while the rest of the team logs into each session via a web-portal to assist. A randomized set of perilous risks and locked doors keep them from reaching the end. The browser teammates use minigames to guide the Team Leader through the client-side game, complete the\u00a0\u201cQuarterly Reports\u201d\u00a0and boost the final score.<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>A POTENTIALLY DEADLY EVENT</strong></p>\n<p>You are about to enter an overbearing, dangerous, but professional space. Highly charged electrical sparks, lava, rows upon rows of locked doors await you on your teamwork test. But dying is not acceptable here in\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Big Corporation Inc.</strong>! After all, you can always count on your teammates, right?</p>\n<p><strong>OUR GAME</strong></p>\n<p>Chris Plante, the instructor of\u00a0<em>Intro to Game Journalism</em>\u00a0once said, \u201cDon\u2019t make THE game, make YOUR game.\u00a0It is in this thesis project that we truly grasp what he meant. It is not about following successful AAA or Indie standards, but finding out what\u00a0we\u00a0love, what makes sense for\u00a0our\u00a0players, and what makes sense in\u00a0our\u00a0game. We are proud of this small, personal game called <em>The Official Teamwork Test</em> and look back at this experience as a testament to our perseverance and teamwork. We thank you for your time and hope you feel this passion in your\u00a0<em>TOTT</em>\u00a0experience as well.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><strong>Known Bugs:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Reconnection on the web client is currently not available upon refresh, to help with testing (please do not refresh your page while playing) - we recommend using a computer browser instead of mobile</li><li>Resizing the Unreal client window will sometimes break the game.
