It is no longer about trying stunts on empty tracks but about getting a complete real life feel of driving and drifting. <br/><br/>Key features: <br/><br/>- Realistic 3D Physics for cars movements <br/>- Different Tasks/Assigments <br/>- Perfect perfomance on all devices <br/>- No in-app purchases - just drift, earn points and unlock new levels! <br/><br/>So drive like a Mad Cop, drift your way through to glory!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:19:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/680/6805c51435b5a84d0b1807c1c0023622_blx63CK.jpg", "website": "http://www.evertap.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["UniqueApps"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Unique Apps"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
