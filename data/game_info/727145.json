But visual novels are just as good!<br/></p>\n<p>I'd like to release Heart Sigil Elchemia in late-2023; at the moment the common route is fully written, and all romance routes have been outlined. Since I'm funding myself in creating this game, the main blocker will be time and energy, but I hope to have updates every month, and possibly a longer demo by the end of 2022.<br/></p>\n<p>To follow the development of this game,\u00a0sign up for the monthly newsletter, which will include sneak peeks at development and some unique art!
