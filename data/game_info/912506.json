{"id": 912506, "slug": "duet-pass", "name": "Duet Pass", "name_original": "Duet Pass", "description": "Prologue\r\n<p>Two wizards got stranded and lost in the woods full of monsters. Since they are wizards, defeating these monsters is a piece of cake for them, and they have survived for a few days. However, one of the major weaknesses of a wizard is that they'll run out of mana-energy, sooner or later. Eventually, they were left with only a small amount of mana-energy. Luckily, they were able to come up with a plan to make the most of this remaining energy.</p>\n<p>One wizard proposed that having a single fireball, passing with each other to defeat enemies may conserve their energy. He suggested using his remaining energy to cast the fireball. However, the other\u00a0wizard pointed out that there was a risk that the fireball might not be secured accurately. As a solution, he suggested casting a homing spell on the fireball to increase its accuracy. He also offered to use his remaining energy to cast the spell, since he was the one who came up with it and no one else could do it.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Your goal is to guide these wizards to survive... a little longer. The key to their survival lies in\u00a0their positioning within the area since the fireball is now casted with a homing spell. This means that the trajectory path of the fireball will be affected by the wizards' location. You have to make sure that the fireball hits the enemies by positioning the wizards strategically. </p>\n<p>But no worries, power-ups and health-ups are there to help you. To know more about the controls of the game and what these different power-ups does, there is a \"How to play\" section in the game where you can see the detailed instructions about this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This mode is just a\u00a0training ground for its upcoming features. It is played by a single player that controls two characters simultaneously. Your goal is to survive by defeating enemies and running away from them.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T13:49:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad781ce10541cffbd78e87aa764f4cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Kiaru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
