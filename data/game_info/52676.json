The games were localized by Working Designs. Plans to localize the games had been fostered by Working Designs since the late 1990s, but the compilation was not released until 2002.</p>\n<p>The games form a trilogy with a continuous story throughout each. Although Arc is the primary protagonist, each game features a new lead character. Arc the Lad sets the stage for the next two games and follows Arc and Kukuru as they discover a plot to restore the Dark One. Arc the Lad II introduces Elc, a young Hunter that becomes tangled in the plot and eventually joins the battle against the Dark One. Arc the Lad III features Alec, a young Hunter with a mysterious past.</p>\n<p>Each game expands on the previous one. Arc the Lad II features a much larger and less linear world than its predecessor, and it brings back the cast of the first game in addition to featuring a new group of characters. Arc the Lad III features an upgraded graphics system, replacing the sprite backdrops of the first two games with three-dimensional backgrounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-14T03:14:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a370511878cc7e3c2926fb795981d9f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Sony Computer Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Working Designs"], "esrb_rating": null}
