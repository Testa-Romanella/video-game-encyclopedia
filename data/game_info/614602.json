{"id": 614602, "slug": "deep-down-doriens", "name": "Deep Down (Doriens)", "name_original": "Deep Down (Doriens)", "description": "<p>Action RPG game where your allies are controlled with deep learning.<br/></p>\n<p>'''</p>\n<p><strong>Note from Dev</strong>: The AI is pretty broken when playing with DPS. It might be better to select any of the 3 other possibilities to have the best experience !<br/>For some backstory about it, we trained all three character to be able to focus on their role. The DPS follow the lead and try to hit close monsters, the tank try to take the damage, and the mage heal the others. But during training, the tank focused on shielding so much, that it is lost when there are no monsters ! Moreover, during the training, the mage and him grew pretty close, and became good friends. So she focus more on healing him. The end result is that these two refuse to help the poor DPS...</p>\n<p>'''<br/></p>\n<p>The game has a save functionality. So if you are stuck or bug, you can reload it and get back to the lobby.<br/></p>\n<p>'''<br/>This game is our first experimentation with Deep Learning in video games. The main idea is to be able to use reinforcement learning as a party, with each character having its own unique abilities. We used ML Agents from Unity to train the characters.</p>\n<p>It was quite harsh to learn all about ML Agents, and apply reinforcement learning in such a short time.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>As the PNJ says, they might lack hidden layers, but you can still enjoy the game !<br/></p>\n<p>'''<br/></p>\n<p><strong>AI training details:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>DPS</strong></em>: The main goal of the DPS was to be able to follow the leader, while going slightly out of the way to slain some monsters. He's also an alcoholic (a whole life of butchery take a toll on him...) and so we wanted him to go catch the wine bottle on the map.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the training, he became berserk at some point and stopped following the leader to focus exclusively on attacking monsters. So we had to teach him some manners, and now he is following the leader quite well !</p>\n<p><strong>Tank</strong>: He was trained to go closer to the monster when the party is approaching one. He also have a defense raise ability that we want him to use when close to monsters. Also, he is scared of snake, and will avoid them at all cost.</p>\n<p>The training is not what we can call a success, with him. Maybe all the hit taken during years of adventures cost him his brain... I believe that we focused to much on close combat during its training, and he is kinda lost when no enemies are nearby. But as the first zone don't have monsters, it is difficult to lead him outside. It is an overfit of combat situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mage:\u00a0</strong>The\u00a0mage\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0main\u00a0healer\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0party. In\u00a0consequence,\u00a0we\u00a0wanted\u00a0her\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0heal/revive\u00a0the\u00a0ally. To\u00a0do\u00a0so,\u00a0we\u00a0focused\u00a0the\u00a0training\u00a0on abilities\u00a0and\u00a0mana\u00a0save. Also, she loves nature, and wants to hug all trees she can find !</p>\n\n<p>As the mage have more abilities, and have to focus more on her ally situation (position/HP/death), it was really hard to get a correct behaviour for her. We have to extend the training and test more diverse situations.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0healing\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0quite random\u00a0sometimes,\u00a0but\u00a0overall,\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0take\u00a0the\u00a0time, she\u00a0can\u00a0save you.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0mana\u00a0saving\u00a0part was\u00a0too\u00a0hard\u00a0to\u00a0achieve,\u00a0as\u00a0to\u00a0many\u00a0unknown\u00a0situation arise\u00a0when\u00a0playing\u00a0compared\u00a0to trainning,\u00a0she\u00a0can easily\u00a0become\u00a0a\u00a0spell\u00a0machine\u00a0gun.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I believe that the main mistake we made during the training was not focusing enough on non-monsters situations. In consequence, the healer spam spells at the beginning, and the tank look frenetiquely for enemies that are not there. The DPS not so bad though !<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>'''<br/></p>\n<p>Design and music are originals !</p>\n\n<p>Adrien Dorise: dev, design, music</p>\n<p>Ronan Pons: design</p>\n\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/user-564089708/sets/deep-down-ost<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:57:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ab/3ab24a6f663cdd87e184a82bfd0bb56f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Doriens"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
