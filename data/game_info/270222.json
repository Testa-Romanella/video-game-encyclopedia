I say, not really recalling entering it. I am tired, I am injured, and school is kicking my butt, but I can always go for cute writing. I open my programs - \"Let' do this\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>My sister the cat girl, or if you want to get technical \"My Sister Decided To Listen to A Music Cd Backwards and Now She Turned Into a Cat Girl Do I comfort her?\" is my project for Light Novelber 2018.\u00a0It tells the story of two young sisters who live together and, through the rebel streak of one of them, transformative experiences occur. It's a light-novel with just the minimum amount of interactibility to classify it as a \"game\". Done in TyranoBuilder, the story was something I kicked around for a while before deciding to finally pass it to paper (or screen as it were).<br/><br/>Though it was done in about 2 and a half to four hours. I still hope you enjoy it. And if you did, why not leave some feedback? Thank you.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba539e07da3b74f4718176a04db2f6eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mcportugalem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
