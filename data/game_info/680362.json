From simply chicken zombies, to unidentifiable creatures, you must\u00a0fight your way to glory!</p>\n<p>Go to hell itself, the zombie nest itself, or even the Z-Dimension! With a fun selection of areas, you can eradicate more and more zombies!</p>\n<p>You choose yourself how you want to slay zombies. Fast-shooting machine guns? A slow-shooting sniper? How about transformed\u00a0as a giant bird? Maybe using a gun that can switch between sniper and machine gun at any moment?</p>\n\n<p>Boopdoop Discord Server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/db2xN9m</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:19:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a7/4a7331d8aaa8e18efdf6d0c8490a7dbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BoopDoop"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
