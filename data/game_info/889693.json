I wanted it to\u00a0be unapologetically pink and girly and I wanted it to be something I would love to see and play!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since I'm a practicing Muslim, I didn't add a background music, and I also didn't draw any living creature. It was a nice challenge to design a game using inanimate objects, and I guess this is a proof that since we Muslims are not allowed to do certain things that doesn't mean we can't achieve fun creative feats!</p>\n<p>I don't know if my game would be fun and replay-able for you guys, so please let me know if you did enjoy it! Thank you!</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u2606\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2606\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u2606</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Fonts used</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Pony Club (In\u00a0Canva)</p>\n<p>Sacramento\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trocchi</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Some of the assets are drawn by me and some are from Canva and the internet.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Some game icons are from:\u00a0https://www.iconsdb.com/</p>\n<p>The inspiration for the\u00a0background is from this image:\u00a0https://wallpapersafari.com/w/8fnYEi#google_vignette</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>\u2606\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u2606\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u2606</strong></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T20:26:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc28376738d4f6c4232a73db6a7e300b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MunaLail"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
