{"id": 590716, "slug": "the-witchs-way", "name": "The Witch's Way", "name_original": "The Witch's Way", "description": "<p>The Witch's Way is an interactive story adventure that is a collaborative endeavor with Prof. Doris C. Rusch at the Department of Game Design at Uppsala University in Gotland, Sweden, and Prof. Andrew M. Phelps at the HITLabNZ at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, NZ\u00a0and the AU Game Center at American University in Washington, D.C., USA. In addition to standing on its own as a game experience, the Witch's Way also seeks to illustrate design principles with respect to designing games for transformative play. The authors have collaborated over the past several years in the creation of a design framework for transformational, existential game design and a brief bibliography of work in this area is listed in the credits. It is our hope that this game helps serve as an example of the design model as developed thus far, as well as being a moving experience for our players.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T10:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc2/fc21768a3a284807d7bf5098a3166f88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Deep Games Lab", "Andy Phelps"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
