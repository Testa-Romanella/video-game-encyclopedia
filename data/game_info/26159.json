The creatures follow the lines you trace along the \n      water. There are six types of Trapy in all, each with a unique color and \n      sound. All Trapy plankton produce different tones depending on the \n      direction they swim. They produce the lowest-pitched sounds when they \n      swim to the right and produce higher-pitched sounds as their path veers \n      to the left.\n    </p><p>\n      More Electroplankton Games!\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Hanenbow\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Rec-Rec\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Nanocarp\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Electroplankton \n        Beatnes\n      </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e64e9198b4c25550db6ff8c06ba0f8e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
