Each will has a different mission but the save files should work between the versions (maybe).</p>\n<p><strong>Controls and build information</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: In the versions 0.43 and 0.44 you can simply press Escape in the intro mission to get to the \"mother ship\" aka shop. And while you are on a mission pressing TAB will add 100% to your Shield and Hull, so that is a \"cheat\" :D</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>\n<p>This is something I have decided early on - <strong>this game will be always free of charge</strong>. Even if it becomes playable. I have a job and this is my hobby.</p>\n<p><strong>I need YOU!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>But I cannot do it alone, I need a community, I need people to help me keep interest in this project. I hope that by creating an active Dev Log and providing screenshots, videos and when available playable demos of each new release, we can build a community that will be willing to stick around, provide feedback and their insight.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of ideas about the game, but nothing is set in stone so feedback from people and suggestions will be implemented to the game so that the final product can be fun for everyone! (well not everyone, but for people who like space games).</p>\n<p>I am a solo developer, but maybe in time more people will join in, who knows. I am not actively looking for members though. If that changes I will let you know :)</p>\n<p><strong>Everything will change</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics, sound, art style, levels, design.... everything is being rebuild.</p>\n<p>Hope you will Follow me here, or on twitter or YouTube to stay in touch!</p>\n\n<p>Everything used in the uploaded demos is from free game assets websites with CC0 license which helps as this was 3 years ago and I have no clue who did the sprite set and the music. The GUI was my work, the effects, spaceships and other assets in the game were from a pack that I edited in Photoshop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T05:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/762/7627274f6634a8061733e18acce52a74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MEITdev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
