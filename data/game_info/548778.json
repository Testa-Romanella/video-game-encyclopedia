And it does that, while also telling an interesting story, inspired by true events. These are things I experienced and learned about, in the 3 weeks that it took to create this discord.</p>\n<p>(Do join in as you'd like: https://discord.gg/hVVdm5Z )</p>\n\n<p>Currently Known Bugs:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>In the settings/options, the 'Fullscreen' option shows 'OFF' when it's ON, and vice versa.</li><li>Sometimes the faceart would clip for a moment.</li><li>You can't quit the achievement screen using the controller.</li><li>The option for different languages is not currently used. It's there, just in case I want to translate the game once it's complete.</li><li>The game runs faster on monitors with higher than 60 FPS refresh rate. (Solution: You want to go into the game's option/settings and switch '<strong>Sync FPS Monitor</strong>'.)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Do be sure to comment and rate after you play the game!
