DON'T ! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE ! THE SKY (or ceiling, as you see fit) IS FALLING ! Avoid the falling cubes to avoid being stomped into oblivion, and watch your steps, you don't want to fall into the void beneath this weird building.</p>\n<p>You'll run through an infinite stream of small worlds, ranging from narrow corridors to really big open areas, where either the ceiling is falling or the ground is falling. Stay aware of your surroundings, be fast, and everything will be fine !</p>\n<p>In case of emergency, or when you want to get past a big pit, you can use your dash ability, just aim where you want to go, and activate it ! You have free dash charges, and those will refill over time.</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can, and go through as much \"rooms\" as you can to score high !</p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n<p><strong>Move your mouse</strong>\u00a0to rotate the camera (well it's a first person game...)</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>ZQSD/ WASD</strong>\u00a0to move around</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Shift\u00a0</strong>to run</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Space\u00a0</strong>to jump</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>CTRL (left)\u00a0</strong>to crouch</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Left Mouse Click\u00a0</strong>to dash</p>\n<p>Press\u00a0<strong>Escape\u00a0</strong>to open the pause menu</p>\n<strong>CREDITS</strong>\n<p><strong>Thomas Lebrun (Raivk)</strong>\u00a0- VFX &amp; 3D Art, Code &amp; Audio, Level Design &amp; Building</p>\n<p><strong>Julien Kuhn (Cybions)</strong>\u00a0- Development, Level Design &amp; Building</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-14T03:05:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71ea79edd401191412a596ee912ff465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raivk", "Cybions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
