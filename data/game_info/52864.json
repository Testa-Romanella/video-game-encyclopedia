Destrega separates itself from other games by creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors type of fighting system. When timed right, you can cancel or overpower your opponent&#39;s attack. The game uses two types of fighting styles: close-up hand-to-hand attacks and Relic attacks, which are the long-range projectile attacks. You can also fight in the air, on the ground, and on top of structures.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-29T12:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/34e/34e0e6a522fd0d3e1581a121908f97bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": ["Omega Force"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Koei"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
