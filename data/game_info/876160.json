If you go up or down hills you should go slowly. On straight paths you can accelerate to get to the finish line faster.<br/><br/>You have two controls to swing and balance the front of the tractor: when climbing an obstacle such as rocks you can swing the front of the tractor up to improve the front traction of the vehicle and better clear the obstacles.<br/>If, on the other hand, the tractor is falling downwards, you can rock the front end upwards and keep the vehicle balanced so that it does not tip over.<br/><br/>If you do not control well the farm truck will overturn.<br/><br/>You have the option of acquiring more speed if you are not satisfied with the speed that the tractor can reach.<br/><br/>Have a fun time with all the circuits specially designed for this tractor and above all try not to run over any animal during the tours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T18:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573c6f1fe566ffd90c50757f433563c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MMeGAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
