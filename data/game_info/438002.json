{"id": 438002, "slug": "lockdown-chasersgaming", "name": "Lockdown (chasersgaming)", "name_original": "Lockdown (chasersgaming)", "description": "<p>A highly contagious virus has plagued\u00a0the world causing a global pandemic...</p>\n<p>Governments across the nations have ordered every citizen to stay in their home to help stop the spread until a vaccine can be found...</p>\n<p>With Police forces stretched, Gangs have taken control,\u00a0\u00a0looting &amp; kidnapping those they can help fight the virus and save lives.</p>\n<p>These gangs are under the control of one man.... Dr S, evil crime lord and head of the pharmaceutical giant 'Raincoat'.</p>\n<p>He will stop at nothing to be the first to create a vaccine. Should he succeed he will hold the world to ransom.</p>\n<p>One man has vowed to stop Dr S's plans. An ex marine who's known as 'nineteen'. And with the help of his trusted friend 'cheddar', a retired charter pilot, they will risk it all, when everybody should be on Lockdown.</p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: move Up, Down, Left &amp; Right.</p>\n<p>X Key: Perform Jump</p>\n<p>Z Key: Perform 'light punch' - repeatedly pressing Z Key will perform a 'flurry' of\u00a0 moves if the first punch lands an enemy. Light Punch, Hard Punch, Light Kick, Hard Kick and finally an Uppercut. This will also pick items that are on the floor.</p>\n<p>X Key then Z Key: Perform a Jump Kick</p>\n<p>Z Key held: If you have a 'Beacon' item you will drop it and a 'Care Crate' will be dropped to you from 'Cheddar'.</p>\n<p>COLLECTABLES:</p>\n<p>Toilet roll: Stolen from a 'Looter', collect these to earn extra points.</p>\n<p>Sanitizer: Stolen from a 'Looter', collect to earn extra points.</p>\n<p>Tazer: Dropped off in a 'Care Crate' or from disarmed enemy's.
