{"id": 961736, "slug": "vitam-finire", "name": "Vitam Finire", "name_original": "Vitam Finire", "description": "<strong>Vitam Finire</strong> is a first person Horror Game made By Nobody, literally. <br/><br/><strong>Plot:</strong> A game where you are a detective assigned to a murder case in the forest, but the real problem is that it won't go as planned and the detective will have a paranormal experience in wich he should find a way out.<br/>I hope you appreciate the work and if there are any problems I will try to solve them as soon as possible (there is a problem that I'm trying to fix, but the game is playable)<br/><br/>The game includes 3 levels in wich you need to find specific objects to find a way out, if you die in a level you can restart from that level or restart from the begining. There will be 2 times that you will be able to make a choice that can change something, but I will not spoil the choices so you can discover them. There are entities that will chase you and will try to catch you, You can run away from them if you want. Use the flashlight to see in the dark, but watchout it can be damaged if you fall somewhere.<br/><br/>I offer to you 2 cheatcodes for the level 2 that can be typed at the begining of the game [If you respawn or reload the level, you need to type again the cheatcode if you want to use it]:<br/><strong>BABY</strong>: It will simplify a lot the level<br/><strong>HARCIUS</strong>: Welcome to hell, especially for the noobs<br/>Note: If you use a cheatcode successfully there will be a sound that will you hear and a message on the left corner<br/><br/>I added the <strong>Subtitles</strong> so everyone can see on screen what is said in the game. You can disable them on the option menu. [Note: for now they need to be disabled every time you launch the game, They are on by default]<br/><br/>Features that will be added as soon as I can or things that I will fix:<br/><strong>Controller support</strong>: I'm working on it and I will try to implement it as soon as possible<br/><strong>Loading Button</strong>: I had a problem with the Loading Button and I had to disable it. I am searching the problem and a solution<br/><strong>Color Blind settings</strong> I will add the option as soon as I can.<br/><br/><strong>I hope you like the game if you have something that you want me to add/change or if there are bugs please write them down and I will see what can I do, because there is only one person working on the game, If you don't like it, I hope that the next one will be more interesting for you.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T02:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d4/4d4082b1e49385a809de10e7e752a277.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nobody GG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nobody GG"], "esrb_rating": null}
