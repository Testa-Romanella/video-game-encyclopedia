However, you may notice that it is not a part of said jam, this is because on the final day before I could submit there was a major power outage in my area which lasted 3 days, thus preventing me from submitting the game. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game never the less, feedback of any sort is always appreciated, and if you are suffering with mental health in any way, I would heavily advice seeking professional medical help.\u00a0And just remember that you are enough.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>arrows to move</p>\n<p>z to jump</p>\n<p>x to dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd455f6fdec67cfe34eb319045ae7a70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OILSLICC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
