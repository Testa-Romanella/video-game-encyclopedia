This game took me 4-5 days to create. It is not part or for a GAMEJAM. The best part is, is that this game is on-going, never ending, looping kind of game! You can unlock characters and collect coins and power-ups! There will be updates to this game every week until the final version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing my new game!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T09:25:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d69/d699bc3699d705d4745ff79dc5fd657d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Official_LAMASTUDIOS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
