It'll be short and sweet, like a first person version of Hakaiman or the shooty-bits from Sid Meier's Covert Action. It's also inspired by the original plans for <em>Wolfenstein 3D, </em>which was originally going to feature more stealth elements.</p><p>It's got destructible environments, possibility for stealthy play, guards to kill, prisoners to rescue and soon it'll have some light RPG elements and skill customization. Procedurally generated levels are a possibility too, down the track.</p><p>At the moment, it's rough and only barely playable, so keep an eye on my tumblr devlog for updates.<br/></p><p>CONTROLS</p><p>WASD - Move</p><p>Mouse - look</p><p>Left Mouse - Fire/Detonate explosives</p><p>Right Mouse - Throw grenade/plant explosives</p><p>R - Reload<br/></p><p>1/2 - change between gun and explosives</p><p>E - melee, punch walls to lure guards</p><p>Space - Use/talk</p><p>C - Crouch</p><p>Shift - Walk silently</p><p>LATEST VERSION: 0.012 7/7/2015<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb6/bb67a07ba62dc7d40032df1b7eeac3cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Poor Richard"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
