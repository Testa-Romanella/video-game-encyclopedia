But it's getting dark now.</p>\n<p>Use the A and D keys to move her.</p>\n\n<p>I often spoke to them in the late hours, but they only spoke back when I turned the lights off. I asked them if they knew why I was here and they told me it was because I was different. They told me that I only knew they were there because I was different, but that wasn't the difference that put me in here. They would follow me when I left my room and they stood around me while I was on the table. They were the only thing that kept me together, the only thing I had to hold onto. As I was different so were they, it was why they were here too. Like we all were from a different place then this one.\u00a0Their shadows were the only contrast I had in that world of white. When I was released, I never saw them again. But sometimes I still hear them when the lights are off. Sometimes they pull me one way when I'm walking another. They say I need to survive, that the world needs me. That more then one world needs me. They told me I was one of the prophecies, the prophecies that were used to paint her portrait. I want to believe them, I want to be special. But sometimes I forget things that are there, and sometimes I remember things that aren't there. Maybe they're the reason I was put in the white world, maybe they want me to feel special because I want me to feel special and I and they are both me.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you enjoy this experience be sure to rate it, recommend it to your\u00a0acquaintances or;\u00a0leave a comment on what you appreciated along with\u00a0any suggestions you may have for improvements.\u00a0 Without this support it is very difficult for games to gain any kind of public attention.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d53/d53a1ad9194047ebf418a0172d539031.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Portrait Prophecies"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
