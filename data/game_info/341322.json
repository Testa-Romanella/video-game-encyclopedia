KaSgar team is a passionate duo of young\u00a0hobbyists that wanted to gain experience and skills trough work and dedication. We worked hard and dedicated a lot of our time, to deliver our most\u00a0ambitious project yet...</p>\n<p><strong>Marigold</strong></p>\n<p>Spirit hoarder exiled from his home commits to his research on animation with limited resources, using spirits of animals to create nature defiling creatures. To makes his creations stronger he needs a familiar tome that young half-elf wizard Marigold possesses. Player's task is to defend mage's home for few nights untill she becomes strong enough, to defeat the mastermind once and for all.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Marigold is a hybrid of classic tower defense games and targeted\u00a0spellcasting. Enemies come from the dark forest\u00a0and player will defend the barrier protecting wizard's home\u00a0with fire spells. In order to\u00a0succeed you will have to master combining spells and memorize some attack patterns, while improvising with\u00a0flashy\u00a0magic!</p>\n<p><strong>Ending word</strong></p>\n<p>Marigold is a passion/learning project, that's why we're publishing it for free! It's our first\u00a0big\u00a0game. We know it isn't perfect, but we still love it! We learned so much during\u00a0development. We want to thank anyone that helped us in the process of creating Marigold, our amazing testers, our lovely friends and family.</p>\n<p><strong>Donation</strong></p>\n<p>We know that the game isn't AAA quality, but if you like what you see, or you want to support us\u00a0 - consider donating a little!
