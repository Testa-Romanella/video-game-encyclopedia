Explore a modern optimistic world, where technology has developed to coexist with nature and society has evolved in a cooperative direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Elemental Flow is a role-playing game (RPG) with conversation encounters instead of battles. Players explore photography-based environments in a fictional world inspired by real cities, learning more about each culture\u2019s hardships from its residents. Encounters are active and involve the player using a variety of abilities with the right timing and execution. Abilities correspond to one or more elements (fire, water, air, earth) and can involve talking, listening or thinking, all the while letting the other person express themselves as well, until you both reach an understanding.</p>\n<p>Elemental Flow aims to uphold what many people love about RPGs (high levels of customisation, interesting worlds to inhabit, characters to meet and encounters with varying challenge levels) while housing a different kind of story \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t centre on violence, but rather on communicating with others.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><em>Sofia's Side Story</em>\u00a0is a short chapter (around 30 minutes long) taking place before the events of Elemental Flow. After\u00a0finding herself in an unfamiliar place, Sofia is tasked with helping spirits get along using her newfound conversational abilities.\u00a0This side chapter acts as a tutorial of sorts, letting players experiment with the\u00a0systems of Elemental Flow, and begins to hint at the kind of world characters will inhabit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A controller is recommended, but you can also play with keyboard and mouse.\u00a0Any tips will go towards making Elemental Flow!</p>\n\n<p>We've tested earlier iterations of\u00a0Sofia's Side Story and received great feedback,\u00a0but we still want to hear what you think!\u00a0Please fill out this survey if\u00a0you have time. It will help us make the full game more interesting!
