Me and my team had 24 hours to make the game, but after:</p>\n<ul><li>Changing the whole concept 4 times</li><li>Changing the engine to GameMaker and switching back to Unity after a while</li><li>Many problems with software</li><li>And hardware</li></ul>\n<p>...We ended up with this maximum bare bones thing, made in last 3 hours of the gamejam. Play at your own risk.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy. I guess.</p>\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>You can win the game by either pushing other player off the stage, or having the throne claimed at the end of the round, which takes 30 seconds. If one player (or both players) disappear it means the game is over and only winner is still left. You can press Alt + F4 to exit. No, really, there's no restart or exit button in the game. And no UI.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Player One<strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Press <strong>WASD</strong> to move</li><li>Press <strong>J</strong> to claim the throne</li><li>Press <strong>K</strong> to push off\u00a0enemy player</li></ul>\n<p>Player Two:</p>\n<ul><li>Press <strong>Arrows</strong> to move</li><li>Press <strong>Num1</strong> to claim the throne</li><li>Press <strong>Num2</strong> to push off enemy player</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d7/9d746013a9691a67beee0afc2d22e55d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
