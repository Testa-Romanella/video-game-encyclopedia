The theme is \"Stronger Together\" \u00a0and\u00a0you should soon find out that if the pieces are not put together, you are weaker since you'll have limited view of the scene. There are few obstacles in the game you have to overcome, and it is quite easy to do that, if everything is together.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>I have used Aseprite for art and animations, UNITY as a game engine and FL Studio for music and sounds. Everything has been created from scratch during the jam. (linkof the code repository)</p>\n<p>If you'll give my game a shot, I would love to hear any feedback or screenshot of your best score.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>\n<p>ps. huge thanks to mr. Oddsocks and Sanguis for code advisory and testing as well as anyone who have joined me on stream during the jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:44:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba2/ba22ec0f58dc287d0920cd1e0c0c34b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jin9310"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
