You play as 4 members from a government funded mercenary group called Product 2. Kumakiri, Yan, Qin, and Kajino must go on a mission to retrieve the Okaku. Some may make it back and some may not. Ryan Kamato as your navigator tells you what is happening and who is around you.\u00a0 You also have natives trying to stop you from obtaining the Okaku. On top of all of that, there is another 4-man group trying to get the Okaku too. So you have a mercenary group and natives trying to stop you. Nothing that Product 2 can handle.
