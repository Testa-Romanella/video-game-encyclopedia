It is about observing all the interactions as you control the tiger and try to get a high score by eating zebras.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How To Play</em></strong></p>\n<p>When you have the green light to move, use either WASD or the arrows to control the tiger. When the tiger moves she leaves behind tiger tracks, a zebra will not cross her tracks. Use the tracks to control the herds into larger groups. When you eat a zebra you will also eat all zebras that are touching that zebra. Eating larger groups gives you more points.</p>\n<p>The tiles all have interactions with the animals.</p>\n<p>The Zebras need to eat grass at least every three turns.\u00a0\u00a0Grass when eaten turns into dirt. Dirt when rained on turns into a impassable lake. When a zebra dies its bones fertilize the ground to create overgrowth. When a zebra enters an overgrowth is spawns an additional zebra. The game is forced to conclusion by lakes being created when rain is generated on dirt. Rain has a 2% chance to spawn on any tile at the beginning of tigers turn. There are many other interactions.</p>\n<p>Each turn you lose 50 points. If you get down to 0 points you starve. If all the zebra\u2019s die you lose.</p>\n<p>Credits;</p>\n<p>I did not make the music or sound. I coded and did the \u201cart\u201d. My brother Josh Harriman created the title screen.</p>\n<p>Music: SoundImage.org Tiger SFX: FreeSoundEffects.Com</p>\n<p>I wish I had more time as I know the game ins\u2019t perfect. It feels a little sluggish while you wait for your turn. Also its very luck based.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Playing.!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T12:37:15", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryyguy31"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
