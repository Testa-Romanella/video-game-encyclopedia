The Theme this week is: Seasons</p>\n<p>Disclosure: I used an Artpack for this game.</p>\n<p>Used Artpack:\u00a0https://rottingpixels.itch.io/four-seasons-platformer-tileset-16x16free</p>\n<p><strong>Help Frosty to collect four magic potions that will grant him immunity against heat.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The potions are hidden in each of the four seasons. Switch through the seasons to find them all. But be careful, Frosty doesn't survive long in the heat.</strong></p>\n<p>The level design is not as good as I had hoped, but i guess three hours is a bit too little to create a good multi-layered level.</p><p>Source Code:\u00a0https://github.com/TLochow/Keep-Your-Cool</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T04:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/729/729531084795b35f791dd0c17878fc1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Charlie Gray"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
