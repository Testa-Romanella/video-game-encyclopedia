You can paint each voxel of your sculpture in any color. You can save ONE model and open it next time to continue working on it. There are several types of tools available in the game 1*1*1 (blocks), 2*2*1 (blocks), 3*3*1 (blocks). Training at the first start of the game will help you understand the management. The background color of the game scene will change depending on the time on your computer, and calm music will help you relax and distract from problems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T11:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08a/08a81ebb6ec61b6d2bc9a8c5359e9d0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zalupec"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
