The entries in the the 9-nine- series share the same setting and world, but each entry focuses on a different heroine. 9-nine- is a tale of the town of Shiromitsugawa, host to mysterious Artifacts and the superpowers they bestow on their Users. A tale of a brother and sister with a close bond, and also a murder mystery where they hunt down the culprit behind a series of supernatural murders. Each game has an independent story that can be enjoyed on its own. We hope you enjoy the experience that is the 9-nine- series.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The many-worlds interpretation posits that every random motion produces a novel branching universe. A butterfly flapping its wings rarely means a hurricane across the world, and human choices are no exception\u2014our little everyday choices rarely bring about earth-shattering changes. But for Kakeru Niimi, one of those little decisions is about to make a big difference.<br/><br/>One night, Kakeru's cheeky little sister Sora asks him to let her stay the night. And from the seemingly inconsequential moment when he caves in and says yes, a new story is born, a hurricane which will upturn both their lives.<br/><br/>The cadre of evil users, Rig Vega. The noble crew that opposes them, the Valhalla Society. In 9-nine-: Episode 2, these two forces will collide, striking new sparks and shattering preconceived notions. Can Kakeru and Sora put an end to this unveiled threat before it destroys them both?<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Gorgeous art from Izumi Tsubasu (Artist of SakuSaku:Love Blooms with the Cherry Blossoms)<br/></li><li>Multi part series with independent stories per episode<br/></li><li>Two different endings<br/></li><li>CG gallery<br/></li><li>Music gallery<br/></li><li>Movie gallery<br/></li><li>FULL Japanese voice acting (Including the main character!)<br/></li><li>Japanese, English, and Chinese text.
