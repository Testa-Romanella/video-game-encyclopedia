Name's Wu Ming, Human Bartender! I heard from a little birdie I'll call \"Germaine\" that the Iron Lord Dryden is off his hinges. So, I'm gonna climb Felwinter's Peak to deliver the message. And you're going to help!</p>\n\n<p>Using the Z button to jump and directional buttons to move, help me navigate the treacherous Felwinter's Peak. Sometimes jumping won't be enough though, let me tell ya! So be sure to use the X button to activate this harpoon gun I found! Don't worry- I'm sure whoever it belonged to won't miss it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Use the Harpoon on Points of Darkness to get across larger gaps and save me from Falling!<br/></p>\n<p>Some of the planks left from the Golden Age are starting to rot! Be sure to get off em before they break away and you fall!<br/><br/>Watch out for falling Cabal Drop Pods- They're deadly!<br/><br/>They're tough too! Use the Drop Pods that don't crush you to get over obstacles!<br/><br/>And if you happen to see some stupid Ghost (definitely not mine!) hanging around why don't you go ahead and round em up for me? No reason! But I'll be sure to take care of you with some points when ya do!<br/><br/>Make it to Vostok, and Ol Felwinter will be there waiting for the news!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Good luck, Brother! See you at the top!\"<br/></p>\n\r\nBehind the Scenes:\r\n<p>This mod was made with love by Taylor-B- of the Spinfoil Theory Podcast to honor Bungie's 30th Anniversary.\u00a0 An avid fan of both Bungie and Destiny, the similar themes of Celeste 2 and some of the Drifter's Dark Age lore inspired Taylor to make this mod and share it with the Destiny and Pico-8 Communities.<br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Celeste 2 by Maddy Thorson, Noel Berry, and Lena Raine.<br/></p>\n<p>Visual and themed mods by Taylor-B-.</p>\n<br/>Contact:\u00a0\r\n<p>If you would like to learn more about or reach out to Taylor-B- you can find him on his destiny themed Podcast Cohosted with LadyLucida, The Spinfoil Theory Podcast.
