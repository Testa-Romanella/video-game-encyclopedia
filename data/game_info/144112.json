It has a simple concept, where you dodge skulls falling from the sky. More skulls fall down, the longer you play. It took me about a week to make, and may contain slight bugs. This game will always remain 100% free, but if you would like to, you can choose to buy it for whatever amount.</p><p>My goals for this project are:</p><ul><li>Create a basic game using a basic concept</li><li>Make the user interface easy to understand</li><li>Make controls easy to use</li><li>Add a welcoming but challenging difficulty curve</li><li>Create animations to make the game look prettier</li></ul><p>Please leave constructive criticism to help me make this a more fun and challenging game.</p><p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de4079c947634e44d5d15aba39811b15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Link G."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
