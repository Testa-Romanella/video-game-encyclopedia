But you can raise the dead! And they are pretty friendly. To you at least. Not so much to the soldiers and peasants of the countryside.</p>\n<p>You travel trough forests and seas, trying to find the head priest, because he might have an anweser to your origin. And on the way you make a lot of Undead.</p>\n\n<p>One of the bigger things I tried. Got inspired by a gamejam entry and tried to give it my own twist.<br/></p>\n<p>As I believe it is quite fun to let your growing undead horde slaughter the enemies, but the art style broke the whole ting for me. I could for the love of me not make it any less of an eyesore. The current art you see, I already touched up a bit. It was even uglier in the earlier stages.</p>\n<p>Thats why this project never went further than this. You have a couple levels, a bit of story, a cheeky sidekick and I think that is enough.</p>\n\r\nI am a single developer and all my games will be free to play over at itchio/steam/etc...\r\nI am currently making games as a hobby. This won't change in the near future, but with enough support via Patreon I can outsource some parts of game-making like art, sound and music. This will not only vastly improve the games, but will make development much faster\r\nhttps://www.patreon.com/korbohned\r\nYour support is very appreciated!\r\nKorbohneD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31b/31b9d74a6b05f799bb31f187c6962ee0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KorbohneD"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
