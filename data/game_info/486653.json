Enjoy the sights of Egypt while avoiding alligators. Didn't get done as much as I wanted to with this one. Wanted there to be coin collectibles for the speedboat playthrough and wanted there to be bigger differences between retro and modern Egypt but oh well. Final plan was going to be raft level\u00a0be a survival game on the nile, and the speedboat level be a collectable level where you could hit ramps, but ran out of time :(</p>\n<p>Controls: Pretty simple, just up and down arrows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T07:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb1f21722ef3bd5d0d955b8845fb2f1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dice099"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
