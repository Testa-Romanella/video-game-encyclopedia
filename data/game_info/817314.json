The game is that you have to get to an ambulance before your blood level reaches zero, yes, it will not be so easy, since you will have to go through traps and obstacles to reach your destination.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is my first game developed to a functional point so it is possible that the code is not optimal and that it has bugs. I plan to fix bugs and add new levels, items, and features after the game jam is over.</p>\n<p>During the game jam I learned new things and I had a good time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All said, good luck to the rest of the participants.</p>\n<p>- Ernesto \"Revo\" Beltr\u00e1n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T12:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac417742fdda11a235b62122c8bb7cfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RevoStudios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
