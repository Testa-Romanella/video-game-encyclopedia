Due to software limitations, the images of Realm Fisher don't load until the specific passage they are in opens, so occasionally it takes images a little extra time to appear based on size, connection, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udc20 CREDITS \ud83d\udc20</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Producer:</strong>\u00a0Adelina Rose Gowans</p>\n<p><strong>Narrative Designer:</strong>\u00a0Adelina Rose Gowans</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Gameplay Artist:</strong>\u00a0Romeo Knight</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Designer:</strong>\u00a0Robin Hall</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong>\u00a0Mahal Perez</p>\n<p><strong>Code:</strong>\u00a0Al Disfixdog</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Art Team:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Caroline Kirby</p>\n<p>Jesse Braak</p>\n<p>Trey Deutsch</p>\n<p>Adelina Rose Gowans</p>\n<p><strong>Concept Team:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Romeo Knight\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin Hall</p>\n<p>Rae Moore</p>\n<p><strong>Play Testers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Alex Marwaha\r\n</p>\n<p>Anna Pullara\r\n</p>\n<p>Anthony Jacobs\r\n</p>\n<p>Avery Lou\r\n</p>\n<p>Dave Gowans\r\n</p>\n<p>Jasper Fuller\r\n</p>\n<p>Penflower Ink\r\n</p>\n<p>Rae Moore</p>\n<p><strong>Realm Fisher is supported by YoungArts.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to Storytelling Collective.</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T08:25:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c2/7c26c203474e0d6fb8a4fa057eec0727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adelina rose gowans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
