Every 10 seconds you create a Legacy. A legacy is a recording of your actions for the last 10 seconds that are forever stuck in a loop. Be careful! After a few seconds, legacies turn red; at which point, they are deadly. As you survive longer and longer your legacies will become the biggest detriment to your survival. You may want to be strategic about where you move early on when there are less legacies on screen.</p>\n<p>Gameplay Video:\u00a0https://youtu.be/BrNb87FQwmA</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game. I think it is one of the most interesting games I've made so far.</p>\n<p>Quinn</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:35:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/081/08120956e14a731c14da73d543e47aee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BellringerStudios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
