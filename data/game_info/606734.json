It is said to bring good luck, longevity\r\n and \"family peace\". It was also the country's largest Samurai treasury.\r\n Samurai would go to the Oyamazumi shrine to pray for good luck in \r\nbattle. I was then told that if the a samurai was to receive there \r\nwishes they would present their weapons and armour as an offering of \r\nthanks. They didn't tell me much after that. Whenever I tried to bring \r\nit up I was met if looks of fear and I received warnings to never go \r\nthere. I thought that this was just part of some ghost story dreamt up \r\nto get tourists to come to the island, So I decided to pay the shrine a \r\nvisit. What could possibly go wrong?\"</p>\n\n<p>In Oyamazumi you play as the adventurer, sir Flynn Rankin, as they discover a mysterious shrine that is home to the largest samurai treasury in Japan, how ever not all is what it seems.
