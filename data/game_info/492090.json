{"id": 492090, "slug": "rubicon", "name": "RUBICON", "name_original": "RUBICON", "description": "<strong>RUBICON</strong> is a local multiplayer battle arena merging the simple fun of classic couch co-op with a few brand-new twists - figuratively and literally! As fans of head-to-head shooters from the late 90s and early 2000s, our vision is all about rekindling the appeal and nostalgia of playing a game with your buddies in the living room. RUBICON is jam-packed with exciting gameplay features purposefully designed to build an explosive party atmosphere where anything can happen and every round has something new and different. You might get, say, a powered-up shotgun that fires 15 massive missiles with a single trigger pull; on the other hand, you might find yourself pitted against an invisible enemy with a sniper rifle or an adversary whose protective shield's utility is hampered by the fact that he's ballooned to twice his original size. A new weapon every round and a new special modifier after each point means hours upon hours of good old-fashioned fun.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Splitscreen couch PvP action for 2 or 4 players</li><li>A randomized, constantly shuffling arena with over 40 quintillion possible configurations</li><li>A deeply seductive and context-responsive announcer with over 400 recorded dialogues</li><li>12 unique and stacking gameplay modifiers, from supercharged bullets to health vampirism</li><li>6 randomly assigned and tactically distinct weapons, from shotguns to missile launchers</li><li>Full Remote Play Together and Parsec support</li></ul><h3>RULES OF ENGAGEMENT</h3><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T09:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e9eda590774a780509695b76ef1ad61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyrebug Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pyrebug Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
