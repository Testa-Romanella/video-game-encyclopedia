Take on the role of a pilot in a distant future, fleeing his military's base as an enemy attack hits it. Fight through the droves as your adversaries try to get past you at all costs.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Flaming3z for doing the art! I kinda suck at it so... definitely looks better than it would have without him.</p><p>NOTE: The Mac and\u00a0Linux builds of the game have not been tested.
