This game called \"Play With Me\". it is basically an introduction for the full game that i am working on. If everything goes well i'd turn the full game into a 3D based game.</p>\n<p>Play With Me is fictional story and the choices you make lead you to different endings</p>\n<p>I made this game while learning 'How to make games' on Udemy. I am a beginner so go easy on me when you comment. Leave me a suggestion or what you would like me to update, i'd fix it through an update.</p>\n<p>If anyone donate me it'd be help for the main project to design characters ect\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The text based game has been updated. I am working on the full version which will be 3D based where you will play as \"Jason\" and find out the way out of the nightmare. it will be launched soon.</p>\n<p>Players can play as the Cannibal as well. In some point of the game you will be playing as the cannibal/zombie.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc6b114602b3d8642734ae6b87718a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["varun_official"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
