It's always been my dream to turn my own characters and stories into video games.</p>\n<p>I'm developing an indie game based on a character and story I created some years ago, a super heroine named Jet Dancer. She proved to be quite popular among both my real life friends and online audience, so I thought she'd make a great subject for a\u00a0 game.</p>\n<p>The premise is a simple, fun action platforming game featuring a strong and sexy heroine inspired by games of the 80s and 90s. I started the project using Game Maker many years ago, and have since moved to Construct 2, and now Construct 3.</p>\n<p>I have been developing this game for far too long, but I'm finally starting to take development a bit more seriously and I'm hoping to turn this into a worthwhile first indie game project.</p>\n<p>This is a work in progress of the game featuring my early attempt at a tutorial layout, a cutscene, and the first couple of levels. There are bonus coins that the player can collect but they don't do anything yet (I do have plans for them.)\u00a0The game can be played with either <strong>keyboard</strong> or Xbox (or equivalent) <strong>gamepad</strong>. The instructions are accessible within the game.</p>\n<p>This is my first time ever using this site, and I'm in a state of constant learning. So feel free to let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:17:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/859/859b1df5f210af99fe5662be013a5c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dualmask"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
