There is a great deal of optional content to enjoy, and on harder difficulties the battles can last longer, so this time will obviously vary.</p>\n\n<p>Q: Why is this game free?</p>\n<p>A:\u00a0While I do believe this game has monetary value, money is not my goal. My goal <em>was</em>\u00a0to simply finish the game\u00a0(which I've now done), and at this point I just want people to play it and enjoy it, be that for its combat or story. For that reason, I've decided that selling it, even for $1, would detract from a potential audience that could enjoy the game but doesn't have the means to purchase a game online. Aside from that, we began development with no intention of selling it, and I\u00a0feel it would be unfair to commercialize the game after everyone put in their effort and love without having agreed to how money should be handled up front. After speaking with everyone on the team, however, we are open to optional means of monetization such as selling the soundtrack or accepting donations.</p>\n\n<p>Q: If you aren't making money, why are you so eager for people to play it?</p>\n<p>A: Plenty of factors, really. Validation's certainly one. Delusions that this game could attract a fanbase leading to fan-driven works. Wanting to see the efforts of myself and my team actually amount to something would be one as well. But I\u00a0think really, I'd be happy if this game appealed a great deal to someone. Statistically speaking, there's someone out there who this game will resonate with, and I'm always seeking that person.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Q:\u00a0Will there be future installments?</p>\n<p>A: It's called \"Disc 1\"\u00a0for a reason.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Q:\u00a0How else can I support this project?</p>\n<p>A: Play the game. Tell your friends who like the game to play it. Follow us on Twitter. Give us feedback. Tell us what you like and dislike. At the end of the day, we want to make people happy, and hearing that people enjoyed the game is a great satisfaction.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy Axial Disc 1!</p>\n<p>Feel free to contact us at magnumkid11@gmail.com or @AxialRPG on Twitter!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:38:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26b/26bdb9626df36e5e2ce804cf9ff04e95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Violet Spinel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
