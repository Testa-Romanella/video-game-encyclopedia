Mana Crystals are a resource each team can use to boost their Heroes' power.</p>\n<p>Players earn Mana Power by playing in online matches. Mana Power can be used to unlock new Heroes.</p>\n<p>Players can also purchase Gold that can be used to buy new Dice skins, Base skins, and Grunt models for their teams. Purchases help support the development of Mana War.</p>\n<p>To kick off Early Access, I have 20 Heroes available, 10 for the Savagery Faction and 10 for the Fellowship Faction. All players start with 5 unlocked Heroes for each of these Factions.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning folks! The next thing on my list is to add 10 Heroes for the Shadow Faction and 10 Heroes for the Mayhem Faction.\u00a0I will be adding nearly 100 Heroes to this game, with more game types and missions to play, and a 2v2 and 3v3 online PVP mode, and more!\u00a0I\u00a0will also be adding new skins for Dice, Bases, and Grunts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay is most important, and I am looking to build a community and use input from my players to help make this game the best it can be.</p>\n<p>Please join, subscribe, and\u00a0follow Mana War social media so you can share your voice and opinions on this game.</p>\n<p>Discord:</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/zreb8znRtV<br/></p>\n<p>Twitter:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/ManaWar98969030</p>\n<p>YouTube:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL07gHDoSlk3-6m2Gzs4C4g</p>\n\n<p>Want to play against the developer?
