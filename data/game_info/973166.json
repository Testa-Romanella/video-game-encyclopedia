Unfortunately, your club is closed tonight...<br/><br/>But you have another option. You could fence with the Brazil Fencing Club, located in the exotic lands of Brazil. What? South America? No... This Brazil is located in the foil fencing capital of the world: Indiana.<br/><br/>Welcome to Brazil Indiana's Fencing Club, We never close. We have fencers practicing at our club 24-hours a day and 365 days a year. Anyone anywhere can fence with this club. No long car trips necessary. This is because our club only exists in virtual reality! Hope you will join us at practice today.<br/><br/>The Brazil Fencing Club has nine hoosier foil fencers ready to challenge you.   Test your fencing skill and see if it holds up against these wacky fencers.  Use actual real world fencing skills (like beat attacks, disengages, parry ripostes and more) in a virtual reality game that closely simulates actual real world foil fencing.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T08:57:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01d/01d1709ac1166097730dc943373968cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CounterParry"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CounterParry"], "esrb_rating": null}
