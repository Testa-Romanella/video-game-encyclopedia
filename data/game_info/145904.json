For our capstone project, we experimented with mechanics that would be cool to have in our dream version of the game someday. However, many of our ideas\u00a0changed and transformed over the time we spent on this -- more than anything, this was\u00a0more of a project to discover and experiment with what works and what we believe would be fun and interesting.<br/></p>\n<p>All of the assets in the game were made completely from us with the exception of the post processing image effects from Unity Technologies. These included shaders that performed HDR tonemapping, motion blur, anti-aliasing, and screen space ambient occlusion effects to enrich the graphics of the game.</p>\n<p>This game prototype mainly comprised of:<br/>\u2022 3D game world<br/>\u2022\u00a0Combat largely driven by animation<br/>\u2022\u00a0Voice-acted non-player characters (NPCs)<br/>\u2022\u00a0NPC- and item-driven quest system</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f6774b39024750776decd98e81a4ff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Natalia DaLomba", "2kCarlos"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
