{"id": 840474, "slug": "super-asteroid-miner", "name": "Super Asteroid Miner", "name_original": "Super Asteroid Miner", "description": "<p>This game isn't done, it is merely \"Done Enough.\" The game lacks polish, and sound effects are especially disharmonious. Bugs include cutscenes playing in wrong positions, as well as audio playing too loud. The sound effects are rushed and there is no music. When editing keybindings, the corrected controls will take effect in-game but will not be referenced, (if you switched the keybinding for the interact key, the prompt in-game will still show x, even though you changed it to a different key, etc.)</p>\n<p>This game is built to be very difficult, and you will not be able to progress without taking risks.</p>\n<p>However, despite the flaws, I am very happy with how this game turned out. When I first envisioned this game, I hoped it would be the kind of game that 12-year-old me would enjoy playing, and I think I hit that mark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This will be the last game\u00a0 I make in a very long time. I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and I have decided to serve a full-time mission in Brazil. I will be gone for two years, and per mission standards, will have highly limited internet and communication\u00a0access.</p>\n<p>This game was partly born out of the fear that I grapple with. I have never regretted deciding to go on my mission, but the anxiety of attempting something so monumental and life-defining has been something I've struggled with for the last few months. This game in some ways exemplifies that, with claustrophobic tunnels and terrible enemies representing new worries lashing out at you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, in spite of everything, I know that I want to serve this mission. I know that it will bless me and my family forever. I can beat this fear, I can conquer my anxieties,\u00a0 and as I do I will grow.</p>\n<p>In two short years, I will be back, hopefully with passable Portuguese, a thousand new game ideas, a personal testimony of the truth of God, and a deeper love and understanding for all of humanity.</p>\n<p>I hope this game will mean something to you as much as it means something to me.</p>\n\n<p>This project began on the second of May 2022 and ended on the 19th of August 2022.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Trix for assisting with the platformer engine, and the incredible people in the Gamemaker Studio 2 community.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy, old sport!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T14:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a22829ba78a53d70a12362585397d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["THE GREAT GATSBY"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
