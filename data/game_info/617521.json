Alternating will help you move straight.</p>\n<p>Tapping A/D/forward/backward will play pirate sounds!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/573810b7eeefb1d4ba7bf36c3aac4c91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AveryWeibel", "TaylorInfuso", "maiaonaise", "dbirtola", "ZackRLawrence"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
