I was making steady progress... for a little while, then I hit a rut (mentally) after finishing the cold opener.</p>\n<p>I would still very much like to finish this Chapter, and the rest of the Princess Panic story... but I can see it's a bit of a daunting task and I don't think I'd be able to do it without help.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are interested in helping with the art on Princess Panic please send me an inquiry!\u00a0</strong>Right now I mostly need help with coloring and background art, with a bit of lineart and cleanup help as well.<br/></p>\n<p>I'd like to at least get this chapter done and see where we go from there. In the meantime, this cold opener has been percolating for a while. So I am gonna go ahead and release it to the public. Right up there. It's Ren'Py, so it may not work in all browsers. Please try different ones until it works, if that's the case. The final version of this will be released for Win/Mac/Linux.</p>\n<p>Inquiries can be sent via DM here at itch or over at Twitter\u00a0<em>@timeforjackie<strong>.</strong></em> I can also be emailed at jackielesnick@gmail.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:13:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/669/669f74762ca8ec567570eecb954d51da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaqueline Lesnick"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
