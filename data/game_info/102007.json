I am a professional music producer and composer who decided to make a video game. Strange, right? Well, not really. Music and sound is 70% of what you experience when you watch or play something, so I decided that making my own game would not only be a great way to showcase my music and sound design, but by building a custom score for the game as I produced it, I thought this may create a seriously powerful sense that you are in this game world.</p>\n<p>However there was one huge hurdle to me making a game: I can't draw.\u00a0I can't afford to pay someone to draw.\u00a0I don't know anyone who will draw for free.</p>\n<p>How did I overcome this? I made my game using exclusively Creative\u00a0Commons video footage and images I found online.\u00a0I spent many hours finding the perfect videos and pictures to suit each scene in the game and then I edited the videos to make them fit the tone or setting more suitably.</p>\n<p>Please tell me how you think I've done in this attempt, as the end goal when this game is finished is to have an immersive experience that makes you feel as if you truly are in the game world!</p>\n<p>IF YOU\u00a0WANT TO BE A PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS GAME:</p>\n<p>I am looking for someone to help me design the user interface, configuration menu, and all the decision buttons for the game. This is a task I can accomplish myself with free tools online, however if there is anyone out there who wants to be a part of this project and contribute their work for free, I would love to have a custom GUI and message window designed for this game! You will of course be featured at the top of the credits along with your websites.</p>\n<p>Where did\u00a0I get the idea for this game?</p>\n<p>This game is based heavily on the book \"Thiaoouba\u00a0Prophecy\" written by Michel\u00a0Desmarquet which, according to him, is a 100% true testimony about his abduction by aliens. You decide what to believe, I'm just here to make the best game\u00a0I can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/251/251428cf5938d696ac7b140796985483.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jordan Winslow"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
