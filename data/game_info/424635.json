I have never made a game before or even created a functioning prototype, so this was a great experience and a wonderful challenge for me as a new developer. The goal is to talk to the other cave dwellers and get their input on how to retrieve food and water from connecting areas within the cave. The theme of the game jam was \"Trust Issues\", so the cave dwellers don't always have the best advice and will sometimes end up getting you killed. Dying will cause the run to restart so it is important to\u00a0use your best judgement or trial and error until you can complete each level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T04:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f07befedf82c44323819af739dfab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninedayte"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
