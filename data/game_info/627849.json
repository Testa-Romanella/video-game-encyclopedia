Make your choices carefully, because everything you start will take   time to finish--just like in real life.</p>\n<p>Place down one of these   automated forklifts to push a box for you, for example, and it'll take   an actual half an hour to finish moving it: <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>You'll just have to go and do other stuff and come back later.\r\n </p>\n<p>You work as an independent contractor for a mining company, but soon  you discover they\u2019re trying to take control of time in order to make you  work for them forever. Manage your money, fuel, and energy while slowly  solving puzzles to collect the time crystals and then pull off  high-stakes stealthy heists to steal back from your employer.</p>\n\n<p>Featuring tons of real-time game mechanics: <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move boxes, grow trees, build bridges, and compact trash--and wait for them to finish.</li><li>A\u00a0story  that unfolds slowly through conversations that work like  real-life  phone calls. Characters will only call you periodically to  advance the  story over the course of days and weeks of playtime.</li><li>Your energy meter goes down while you play, and it takes up to 8 real-time hours of good sleep to fill it up all the way.</li><li>Real-time dynamic music.<br/>\n</li><li>And much more.</li></ul>\r\nA Story of Political Intrigue\r\n<p>The prologue chapter of an epic, explicitly anti-capitalist melodrama, told through lowpoly cutscenes and radio conversations inspired by early cinematic games. The company's CEO and shareholders have come up with a scheme to live forever, but it will mean sacrificing the lives of their workers.

You'll find hints on what to do next, details that expand the story, fourth wall\u2013breaking humor, and more.</p>\n<p>A challenge with real consequences: Don't get caught by guards or let yourself fall asleep, or you might end up stuck waiting it out in jail or the hospital.</p>\n<p>Fixed camera angles in gameplay, just like in the old days.
