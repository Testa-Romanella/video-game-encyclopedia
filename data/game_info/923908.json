What about you?</strong></p>\n<p>Guide your snakes through three biomes and the challenges they present. Or, turn off all challenges and relax into the elemental ambience.</p>\n<p>Gaia Snake is a game about escaping into a stylized natural\u00a0world that is as inviting or as hostile as you wish. Unlockable Day and Night modes let you set the mood as you\u00a0immerse yourself in the deep whispers of seething lava, the whistling winds of an icy river, or the cricket choirs\u00a0of a sleepy swamp.</p>\n<p>Unlock your own pet snakes and grow them as you play. Snakes will grow faster when you play in Challenge Mode, but different difficulties will not affect your rate of progress in any other way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first game and I am excited to finally share it with you.\u00a0Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T10:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ae/3ae4a16e347bac86f677add89a2e8610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TromboSpace"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
