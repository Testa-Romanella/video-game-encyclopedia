Because he is such a rare species, many poachers have sought to catch his kind and put them on display. Jeff, in particular, has been captured and is caged in a very intricate, futuristic maze. His captors even mock him by putting him into a hot dog costume.<br/></p>\n<p>You somehow get a hold of the futuristic maze, but it is very confusing and has special rules. Use your spatial skills to help Jeff escape his confinement and be free again!</p><p><strong>Credits</strong>: Music credits to Mikael Persson and Serjio Corro.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/988c01dd24a9f505fb5d7e0f2c35f9a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cwru-eecs290"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
