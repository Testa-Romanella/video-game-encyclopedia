The system has woken you up, a maintenance droid, to repair the damage, correct the ship's course, and protect the hibernating crew from the cold void.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>LMB: Interact, grab item</p>\n<p>RMB: Throw item, push off wall</p>\n<p>Scroll wheel: Rotate held item</p>\n<p>WASD: Microthrusters</p>\n<p>Your main source of movement is derived from Newton's third law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. By picking up and throwing objects, you throw yourself in the opposite direction with the same amount of force. If you find yourself stuck with no other option, or just want a bit more control as you float through the ship, you are equipped with microthrusters, which will slowly push you in the right direction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:40:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985906752010c3ce1daf784f8611cfc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bazzagibbs", "Kownur"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
