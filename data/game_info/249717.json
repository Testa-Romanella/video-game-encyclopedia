The political climate is changing, people are giving in to their darkest desires, and something less than real appears to be ravaging their world. Join Morrie and friends as they get the chance to take control of their lives and take back what's theirs from the spirits of the past.</p>\n<p>Dimension Blade is an RPG where you control the style of combat. Alternate between turn-based, hack-and-slash, and rhythm style battles at will though a journey about what it means to have free will and what makes life worth living in a world where all chances of salvation appear to be in the past. Explore a world which visually evolves with you, slowly revealing the hidden realism which continues to cast its shadow over their simple lives.</p>\n<p>This is a demo featuring the first act and demonstrating the dimension-switching combat in action.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d50/d50197ee101bfe11cd53dbdbbabc7dd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lawsuit Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
