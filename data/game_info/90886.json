While these two gangs are causing a ruckus, there is a lonesome boy caught up in all of it. It's you! A total loser who is deathly afraid of thugs. But perhaps you can overcome your fear? Maybe you can even ... fall in love?! Or get punched a lot accompanied by a voice grumbling \"MRGRGR.\"<br/></p>\n<p>WORST DATING SIM is a shitpost dating sim involving thugs, hugs, and ughs.
