Over these three pyramids are ten face-up cards.<br/><br/>The twenty-four remaining cards make up the stock. The first card from the stock is put in the waste pile. For a card in the tableau to be moved to the waste pile, it must be a rank higher or lower regardless of suit. This card becomes the new top card and the process is repeated several times (e.g. 7-8-9-10-9-10-J-10-9-8, etc.) until the sequence stops. Along the way, any face-down cards that are no longer overlapping are turned up.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T14:01:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd4/fd4bc37df6f320ab9045e28151cd87aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["RunServer"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
