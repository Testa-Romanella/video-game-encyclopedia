Streching your turtle neck and using your stamina to slide around are key to getting the upper hand on your turtle opponents. In case things start going wrong during a fight little fruit people that are dropped into the fights can be devoured to help recharge your health and staminia. There are two game modes currently in the game, Turtle fight which is a regular fight mode where the goal is to deplete your opponent's health and the other mode is Fruit Fight where the goal is to collect enough blueberries to win a round. </p><p>This game requires at least one controller to player, with the second player using mouse and keyboard. For the best experience two controllers are required.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/808/808a7af3b0ec4f1fbd0717d439edf82e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KawaiiInteractive"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
