It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s a spork that\u2019s more spoon.\r\nYou must take out the other utensils to show that you\u2019re the only utensil that will ever matter. Shoot your laser orbs at the enemies, and avoid them when they start bouncing around. Watch out for steak knives, they split the laser orbs into on death.\r\n\n<p>You can kill enemies to increase your score. What will your high score be?</p>\n<p><em>A small note about performance. All the bouncing and collisions are handled by Unity\u2019s 2D psychics system. If there is an abundance of laser orbs it can make the performance drop harshly. However, there is a system in place to destroy laser orbs after they collide enough times. Also, I have no idea how the WebGL version will perform.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de4/de452f42973f53c7a3ec7932eac22cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ThePoultryMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
