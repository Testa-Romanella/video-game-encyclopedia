A virtual world! A world in which he does not have much authority and only has to do what he is commanded to do. No one in this world can speak. Everyone there is a robot. The situation is very confusing and it is not clear exactly what is happening. He is just thinking of escaping the virtual world.\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In this game, you take personal control and you have to do the things that are asked of you.
