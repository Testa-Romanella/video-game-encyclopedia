The original game was designed to teach school children about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. The player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon&#39;s Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848.<br />\nThe game is the first entry in the Oregon Trail series, and has since been released in many editions by various developers and publishers who have acquired rights to it, as well as inspiring a number of spinoffs (such as The Yukon Trail and The Amazon Trail) and the parody/homage The Organ Trail.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1971-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T01:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/838b67befcf4002999fbcb4058479f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.65, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 25, "beaten": 24, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 34, "suggestions_count": 246, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "Apple II", "PC"], "developers": ["MECC", "Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Gameloft", "Br\u00f8derbund", "The Learning Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
