So for every emotion your character is feeling at the time that will be your class of abilities. For example if you were to talk to a NPC that made your character angry, that would then give you the brawler class. With the brawler class you'll mainly be using physical abilities and less of the focus bases abilities. Each class also has it's own drawback as well. Going back to the brawler class, it's main drawback is that you're more susceptible to focus based attacks, on the plus side for this class you would receive a power increase to deal more damage to kind of balance things out.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T02:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f728b47cc35116828aa88927c86ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julius Webber"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Stormy Starfall Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
