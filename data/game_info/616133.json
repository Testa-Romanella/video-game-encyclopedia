Any support on itch.io, Twitch, Patreon and subscribing to him on\u00a0Youtube will be amazing :)</p>\n<p>This game has 5 levels. You use a jetpack to fly around the floating islands and platforms, collect different weapons and ammo, shoot and blow up aliens and drones and\u00a0collect items to get to the portal in the building with the cosmic globe above.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We have added\u00a0this game's 5 levels as separate games. The full game is the toughest because it has all 5 levels to get through with the same amount of lives as single levels.\u00a0 Single levels\u00a0are great practice before taking on the tough 5 level game.<br/></p>\n<p>Psychedelic Shadow will soon be streaming this game and others of ours on Twitch :)<br/></p>\n<p>7-zip is a free unzipping program. When you have unzipped and opened the main folders\u00a0you will find the application file that has the red GameGuru icon and you double click on that and the game will load. In the game's About section in the main menu it explains exactly what to do and gives you the game's controls.</p>\n<p>Please also kindly help support us by donating to our itch.io games and\u00a0subscribing to our Youtube channel, thank you :)</p>\n<p>Our email address is grenadeware@gmail.com should you like to contact us.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T09:10:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/468240c51004c6b46f91fe1dbdd0af38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grenadeware"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
