What normally happens in a role-playing game then, is revisited to fit the mechanical properties of a game with boards, squares and dices to throw. \r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>The beginning of the story is simple: the young and carefree warrior <strong>Nono</strong>, in her typical heroes wanderings, comes across an edict in which unimaginable rewards are promised to those who will rescue the kidnapped prince of the kingdom! With hopes and thirst for riches, Nono decides to embark on this mission facing a long trip with <strong>Uzu</strong>, a giant snail met on the way. But the journey is not without risks, as well as the naturals pitfalls of the places to cross, Nono and Uzu will have to contend with the emissaries of the mastermind behind the kidnapping, ready to put a spoke in the wheel by any means. </p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>Nono's journey is summed up in <strong>4</strong> looping circular boards, each <strong>64</strong> squares long. <br/></p>\n<p>The purpose of Nono in each board is simple: accumulate enough experience levels to gain access to the clash with the Boss of that area and defeat him. Various types of squares are scattered along the route, each representing an aspect of the classic role-playing games: <br/></p>\n<p>-The <strong>INN</strong>, where Nono can rest and save the game; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-The classic <strong>SHOP</strong>, where refueling of objects and equipment; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>TRAPS</strong> that damage Hitpoints; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>MONEY</strong>, always handy during the adventure; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>MONSTER</strong> squares represent the \"casual encounters\" with the monsters in that area against which it will be necessary to fight to level up; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>MEETING</strong> square allows you to have a chat with local people, which could also assign Nono missions in exchange for rewards more or less generous; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-<strong>HOT SPRINGS</strong> are there to rejuvenate the body and spirit; <br/></p>\n\n<p>-The <strong>BOSS</strong> square, where the battle with the guardian of that level awaits (when Nono will be ready); </p>\n<p>There are other squares that hide events and various mini-games, a source of amusement and money in Pocket Quest! </p>\n<p>During her trip, however, Nono will be periodically interrupted by <strong>Lily</strong>, the little demon emissary. She'll curse our heroine with a magic roulette, casting on her every type of malus, such as not being able to see the squares or the closure of shops. </p>\n<p>This is more or less everything, but there is more than meets the eyes in the history of Nono ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12096fe0bea87fd107ef945263072a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 521, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Testament"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
