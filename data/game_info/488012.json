I joined the Game Jam pretty late and some issues came up (mixed with chronic procrastination). I do plan continuing developing this game as I have a lot of fun ideas and a unique story to tell with these characters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you played and enjoyed the demo, thank you so much, it means a lot.
