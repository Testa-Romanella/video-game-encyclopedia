However, the Christmas gifts have not been arranged for distribution yet. Tomorrow is the Christmas day and everyone in the village, especially the children, are looking forward to celebrate the day. That is where Orange Santa plays a significant role and his only mission is to collect the \"Octa-coins\" and buy the gifts from the Special Orange store located in some of the secret locations. This is easier said than done because these special coins can only be found in some of the secret areas which are under tight security. It is next to impossible for a common Orange man to enter the facility. But Orange Santa is equipped with a special weapon which is sufficient enough to deal with the Fruitus Army. <br/><br/>You play as Orange Santa and you have less than a day in your hand to accomplish your mission. Collect the \"Octa-Coins\" from the enemies, buy the Christmas gifts and distribute them among the children of the Orange villages. Will you be able to accomplish your mission?
