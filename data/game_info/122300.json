Players control Mind Tanks and attempt to destroy one another, they are hidden in the system until they attack another tank, at which point they become gradually more visible, allowing players to strategically decide when to sabotage one another. </p><p>Each player has their own base that every other player will try to sabotage. If they succeed, the player will no longer respawn, and they will be eliminated from combat. The last tank standing after three rounds wins. </p><p>Screen watching is an embraced mechanic.
