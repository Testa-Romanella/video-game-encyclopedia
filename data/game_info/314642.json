It\u2019s possible to end in a tie too. </p>\n<p>And also, at the start of each turn, a bit (or sometimes more than a bit) is transferred to the opponent who isn\u2019t in the current turn. Then the one in turn chooses where to fire a 0 or a 1.</p>\n<p>Shooting a 0 towards the switch (the box in the middle) causes it to spew out 0 and shooting a 1 causes it to spew out a 1. <br/></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s actually based on real-life JK flip-flops in digital electronics:</p>\n<p>(taken from: http://www.hobbyprojects.com/flip_flop/jk_with_set_and_preset.html)</p>\n\n\n<p>(taken from: https://www.electronicshub.org/jk-flipflop/)</p>\n\n<p>The table shows what happens to the output, Q (in the game it\u2019s the 0 or 1 on the displays in the middle of the rabbits) when </p>\n<ul><li>J and K of certain values only affect Q at the start of every clock tick<ul><li>(which in the game is shown by the periodical movement of the rabbits\u2019 left legs)</li></ul></li><li>PRE and CLR can affect the output at anytime regardless of the ticks, but they cannot both be 0s at the same time<ul><li>(in the game if PRE is pressed, the output immediately becomes 1 at the cost of the remaining battery charge, and pressing CLR is similar but causes the output to be 0).</li><li>(running out of battery means game over, so that is your life, which is currency).</li><li>(however having full battery charge doesn\u2019t let you win the game if you don\u2019t end up with 1 when all the bits are used up).</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>I intended for this to be part of a top-down overworld of flip-flops wired together and counting down before a bomb goes off and you have to turn off all the flip-flops in the proper sequence by battling it out with each of them. I overscoped and ended up with just the turn-based battle-system and no sound.<br/> <em> <em> <em>\n</em></em> <em> <em> </em></em></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T07:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c3/4c3c68963bac847a2a01058b053f4a31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["One Seed Fruit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
