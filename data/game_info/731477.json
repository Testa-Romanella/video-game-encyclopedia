You must find the needed keys to escape. But is that all there is? Keep an eye out for hidden secrets.</p>\n<p>Moving will make noise. Moving over debris will make noise. Moving through doors will make noise. Your enemies can hear those noises and will move to investigate. If you are spotted, you must run and hide. Moving slowly will make less noise in all cases.</p>\n<p>Can you make it out alive?</p>\n<p>If you wish to follow development on this game, you can join my discord server or follow me on Twitter. All updates go through my discord server first.</p>\r\nTwitter\r\nDiscord Server", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c219cce8cdb5a5b76718d3c560b9c2ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DargsyWargon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
