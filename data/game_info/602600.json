Seeing the sad future created by human actions, they want to use their power to prevent marine pollution and climate change. After completing the three mini-games, they will win three keys. However, to unlock a good future, they have to work together in the \"To The Future\" final game\u00a0to combine their keys into one. In the end, they can see their long-term economic impacts from protecting the ocean and planet. Humans can dive to see the majestic kelp forest and harvest fishes, which improves the economy of the local communities. Not only do Ocean Heroes save themselves from going extinct, but they also help humans gain sustainable and stable means of income.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's tag along their journey and work together to save the world!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Main Environment</strong><ul><li>The player is a fish named CiCi, and they can swim around the environment.
