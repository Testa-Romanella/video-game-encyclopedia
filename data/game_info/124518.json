He had a lot of great ideas and although content wise it's a very simple game, it's really challenging and a lot of fun to play. I had a great time coding it all together for him and in doing so even learned a few more things. </p><p>Dragon Balls was made in Gamemaker Studio, with Boudi putting in about 5 hours of work to design the game, draw all of the art and play test it and myself putting in about 12 hours of work to code it all together (badly). </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78a97089e4994b4cf03c0d34e71cc4b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Thumbs Gaming"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
