Trees can reproduce.<br/></li><li>Mines, quarries and underworld rifts can be infinitely mined for their resource.<br/></li><li>Houses produce taxes, acting as the primary source of gold.<br/></li><li>Walls can be manned with archers.<br/></li><li>Units gain experience in combat.<br/></li><li>Secret obelisks may be found and activated<br/></li><li>A neutral faction, The Hive, launches periodic attacks on all players.</li></ul><br/>There is a total of 5 civilisations to choose from, needless to say, all with their unique buildings and units. You may reach victory either by destroying all enemy players or by constructing a monument and holding it for 15 minutes.<br/><br/>You can play against the AI or compete online against other human players.<br/><br/>Please note that Andalia is a hobby project. It is possible that not every aspect of the game works as flawlessly as it should. However, I keep taking effort to address any issues that arise and I'm generally open to feedback.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for your interest!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T03:33:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/995/9951cc9adda04d8a4d014f3a2e6977d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 395, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joel St."], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sundust"], "esrb_rating": null}
