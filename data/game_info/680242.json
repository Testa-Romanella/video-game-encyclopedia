Your city.</p>\n<p>You hum a tune to yourself and notice three UFOs rudely interrupt the peace and quiet. They begin to line up an attack run on the poor poor people in the city. Fortunately, you\u00a0are\u00a0a world-class phishing\u00a0hacktivist.\u00a0You\u00a0whip\u00a0out\u00a0your\u00a0laptop\u00a0and begin\u00a0lining\u00a0up\u00a0your counter-attack.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p>1. After beginning a wave the first thing you must do is land a click on the erratically moving UFO.</p>\n<p>2. Now the phishing begins, you must select the most viable option based on the aliens' profile.</p>\n<p>- Don't let the city take too much damage (represented by the line at the bottom</p>\n<p>- The UFO will continue to fire whilst you are phishing so don't let up!</p>\n<p>- Enjoy!</p>\n<p>This was hastily uploaded for the sake of the jam.
