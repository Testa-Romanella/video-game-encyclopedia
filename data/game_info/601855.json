I'm so sorry for this, and thank you to the people who have identified it for me. I will work on patching the game, but obviously the code is locked until the voting period for the jam ends, so I won't be able to update it for a few days. If you're interested in playing the game, please add it to your collection or similar so you get an update when I've fixed the bug. Thanks for your patience and sorry again!<br/></p>\n<p>My submission for Narrative Driven Jam 2! A short cyberpunk adventure where you must solve a crime involving robots and pizza. Try to unravel the crime without compromising yourself. There are three endings.<br/></p>\n<p>I am sleep deprived, and I totally fell off on getting my art done (you can literally see where). But I'm happy with the story and experiment. I'll likely return to this to try and make it a bit smoother/look better.
