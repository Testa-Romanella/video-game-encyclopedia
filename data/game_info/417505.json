Each loop through the game will get faster, so good luck. Collect 7 powerup objects to increase your weapon level. If you get hit, your weapon level will decrease by one. If you haven't got an upgrade to your weapon level, you will lose a life and need to restart the current zone. You will get an extra life for every 20,000 points you collect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:26:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87fc04e872378a24160d24bfa6511fe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mush"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
