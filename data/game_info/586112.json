Then a few years later I thought about it again and decided to do it anyway, but in my own way. This is what I made.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's an interactive story and a match-3 game that takes you through life. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Who knows?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCheers,<br/>\r\n- Kimmo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-07T20:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f53d6f9e042a4a8f1dca7e3679178494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kimmo Lahtinen", "Kimmo Factor Oy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kimmo Factor Oy"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
