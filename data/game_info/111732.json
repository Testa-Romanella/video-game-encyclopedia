Hitting all the bricks results in completing the level\r\nand going to the next. There are 150 levels to complete. Unlike other\r\ngames, however, is the inclusion of power ups other than extra balls.\r\nWhen you hit a brick, there is a chance that a power up will float\r\ndownwards towards the paddle, and can be picked up by touching it\r\nwith the paddle. Certain power ups have positive effects, while\r\nothers have negative, making it important to try to collect the\r\nbeneficial power ups while avoiding the detrimental power ups. There\r\nare 18 power-ups, either good or bad. For example. Some good\r\npower-ups include the blast power Up which destroy bricks around the\r\nhit brick and also makes the unbreakable bricks breakable, the\r\nmagnet, which is able to catch the ball and aim it at any brick that\r\nyou want to hit, and also the fly through brick which makes the ball\r\npass through bricks.</p><p>\r\nYou can choose 3 power ups out\r\nof the 12 power ups at the start of each level which cost you some\r\ncoins which can be collected in the level or can be purchased. </p><p>\r\nThe Game has 150 levels to start\r\nand will be updated regularly.</p><p>\r\nThe Game also has two Game Modes\r\nArcade and Endless.</p><p>\r\nIn arcade your mission is to\r\nbreak all breaks and earn maximum combos and collect all three stars\r\nfor each level to unlock the next.</p><p>\r\nIn Endless you keep playing all\r\nlevels until you loose all your lives.Compete on a world leaderboard.</p><p>\r\nDownload Now !</p><p>\r\n break bricks,Arcade, Casual,\r\nEndless, Games, Temple, Run , Angry , Birds , Subway, Surfers ,\r\nBubble,Mania,Saga,Witch,dx ball,arkanoid,breakout</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/750c901f5252509cfb8d896cd03bc36d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["upup"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
