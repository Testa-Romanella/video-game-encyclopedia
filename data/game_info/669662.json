There are still many assets that were created for areas 3 and 4\u00a0that I\u00a0could implement in a later release if there is any interest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:00:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6d/a6dde6673f66fc1c0e5a581cec662e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brad Make Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
