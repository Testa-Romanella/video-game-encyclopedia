That includes little walls blocking the way and anything that moves. <br/>-You erase things by pressing left mouse button and moving the mouse in any direction like in reality. Fast moves are better. <br/>-You die when you erase the happysmile or some enemy hits you. </p><p>Simple as that but warm your arm before. </p><p>Smile controls: <br/>-move [W][A][S][D] </p><p>Eraser controls: <br/>-move mouse <br/>-erase leftclick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db6/db6e9646bb93a64ddd72442ef3391bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The-Force"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
