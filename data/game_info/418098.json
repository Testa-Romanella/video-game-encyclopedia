{"id": 418098, "slug": "devil-disco", "name": "Devil Disco", "name_original": "Devil Disco", "description": "<p>For some reason you've become trapped in a hellish disco! Your moves are so hot, the floor is bursting into flames. Unfortunately for you there are demons dancing here, and they don't like being shown up...</p>\n<p>Devil Disco is a stripped down, single-actor, turn based tactical roguelike(ish) game, in the mold of Hoplite or the Michael Brough games (868 Hack, Imbroglio etc.). Wherever you or your enemies move, the floor catches alight. You have to maneuver around the dance floor in order to trap your demonic opponents in the fire, while avoiding being trapped yourself. Pick up cans of soda to fuel your special abilities, which can\u00a0increase your mobility, extinguish and set flames, or move things around the dance floor. Trap enough demons within 99 turns to win a match!</p>\n<p>Each match is quick to play (1-10 minutes), and every time you win the game gets more difficult and starts over. It can get pretty tough, but remember that losing is fun! The level you have reached is saved and the game always starts at that difficulty from then on. If you want to change this for any reason, edit the included hiscore.txt file to whatever you want.</p>\n<p>This game was created in one week for the 7 day roguelike challenge (7DRL) 2020. It turned out quite\u00a0fun, so give it a try.</p>\n<p>Currently there's only a windows build - other builds are possible, so let me know if you want one and I can make it.\u00a0I've provided the .love file so you can run it with your own version of Love if you want. Just download from\u00a0https://love2d.org/ and drag the .love file over the executable file (or use the command line if you're fancy).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e50/e50fa30d91aae02701fcffc64bafd8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hairmachine"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
