I hate Monkey Ball. So I decided to make better Monkey\u00a0Ball.\u00a0I also took the opportunity of this project to learn how level loading works in Unity. In all my previous projects I would unload an entire scene and then replace it, but of course that means that I couldn't have objects survive between levels. But I found out that you can just load multiple scenes at once, so for this game I had a base scene with the required persistent objects\u00a0and then loading and unloading levels along side it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T17:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c454864fece9757b297dd0ac7f2a8910.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gorka_Man"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
