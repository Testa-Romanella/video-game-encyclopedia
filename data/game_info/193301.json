Doctor Cleans' latest experiment proved promising but ultimately a failure. Frustrated, he threw his latest experiment out ignoring proper lab procedures and left. Inside the trash, something completely unexpected happened and Goop was born. After getting out of the trash can, Goop is now on a mission to escape to freedom and find its way in the world. Players must take a hold of Goop as he traverses through the military base in order to escape. Players can pound their enemies from above, or spit slime at the expense of health. Once you make it to the third level, escape down to the sewers to allow Goop to be set free.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e7/2e757e4ba5ce53b365d78bae225fe83a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jUser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
