{"id": 871163, "slug": "covid-carl", "name": "Covid Carl", "name_original": "Covid Carl", "description": "<strong>Covid Carl is a Metroidvania/Contra-style 2d side-scrolling shooter.  It will feature a brief story, 10 levels, and boss fights. </strong><br/><br/><br/>The story follows the player as they attempt to stop a super soldier from a government project to vaccinate everyone.  In typical fashion the government project goes awry and he starts mutating people instead.  That's where you come in to shoot or burn almost everything that moves.  Shoot stuff, burn stuff, blow stuff up, and have fun doing it.  That's the game in a nutshell.  Not really much to sugarcoat.  There's no planned DLC.  There will be updates as needed for bugs and maybe a feature addition or two down the line.  <br/><br/><br/>Covid Carl was born out of frustration in dealing with certain societal elements during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has a pretty heavy dose of satire(is it, though?), some self-awareness about how bad it (the game) is, and hopefully more fun than frustration.   Let's be honest, though.  I'm not producing something that's AAA. You can run, jump, shoot, go prone, and die.  Mostly die, in my experience, but I also might be getting too old to have good reflexes.   There may or may not be a flamethrower involved.  Who knows?  I fully expect that the end product will be a mostly well-functioning dumpster fire.  Clearly, I am not made out to be a salesman, as I am being honest and probably underselling this beast I've worked on for the last couple of years. But if it provides whoever pays a pittance for it with a modicum of entertainment, then I'll consider this endeavor a success.  This isn't going to be a work of art, but it is my magnum opus.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T02:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf296e4143927ba14fb1cae89863bab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dumpster Fire Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Dumpster Fire Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
