Help them out and they'll give you advice on how to leave.</p>\n<p>But talking to people at parties isn't easy. You have to type your responses to their questions. If you take too long or misspeak it could have consequences! <br/><br/>If you happen to die, don't give up! You may be able to use <em>some </em>knowledge you've gained from a past life to skip some awkward conversations and pick up where you left off.</p>\n<p>When talking to demons,\u00a0you will sometimes see text at the bottom of the screen. You must accurately type out the response or they'll grow agitated or hostile!</p>\n<p>This is a prototype, it should take only 10-15 minutes to play. If you have feedback about the game so far please submit it here. The full game will take place in an expanded setting and I need your help to shape the direction of the game!<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>WASD: Move<br/>SHIFT: Crouch<br/>ESC: Pause<br/>LEFT MOUSE: Check / Pickup Item / Cycle Text / Advance Text<br/>RIGHT MOUSE: Drop Item / Cycle Text / Advance Text<br/>...and of course the who keyboard when typing!<br/><br/>This game uses placeholder assets that are all under the CC0 License.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T09:47:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84ee5c7a23efce39eeea5a518b410108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evelyn Vi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
