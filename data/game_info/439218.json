It's an exploration of my experience of working with depression during university, and losing control beneath an approaching deadline.</p>\n<p><em>Going</em>\u00a0is quite abstract and odd, so I completely understand if it's not to your tastes. Although I don't know whether I'll be developing it further (I'm moving onto another small prototype now that this is uploaded), I definitely welcome any feedback. Really, hearing from players is the best, and I'd like to improve as a game designer and\u00a0developer.</p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>- Dean</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move:</strong></li><ul><li>WASD</li><li>Arrow Keys</li><li>Left Stick</li></ul><li><strong>Exit:</strong><ul><li>Escape Key</li></ul></li></ul>\n\r\n-CONTENT WARNING-\r\n<p><strong>This game contains imagery and themes relating to depression, self-harm and suicide.
