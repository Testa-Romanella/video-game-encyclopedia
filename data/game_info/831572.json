It's just a small indie project where I trained to do morphing in animation. It was made in a single movement, but I broke it into several animations.</p>\n<p>There are buttons on the side, when pressed, the animation switches.</p>\n\n<p>And on the left you can search for the secret button to view the animation without interruption.<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for watching! I love such projects and drawing with a pencil texture in digital. This project was made using TVPaint and Construct 2.</p>\n<p>Here I am under the nickname game sunlight, but in VK you can find me here:\u00a0https://vk.com/cerdcevina</p>\n<p>________________________________</p>\n<p>Speaking of pencil-drawn games, I still have a dress-up game (click on the picture :))</p>\n\n<p>________________________________</p>\n<p>I have some more cool projects!\u00a0Click on the picture :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc50d8b1fd2da936ec73eabf8c90b259.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
