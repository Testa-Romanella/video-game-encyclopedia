A tight time restriction due to ,you know, life,\u00a0meant lots of ideas couldn't come to fruition and so lots of features were cut, many bugs were unable to be fixed and the game is left in a rather unfinished state. Still though, it was a fun experience and I\u00a0think anyone interested in making games should try their hand at a game jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:32:28", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Burntbacon109"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
