Filling it completely upgrades your weapon.</li><li>The little greenish blue things with purple centers are energy cells (hit point recovery items).\u00a0Pick them up to recover energy so you don't die.</li><li>Each level is exactly the same every time. If you're having trouble, you can practice in Casual mode.</li><li>If you're playing with a controller, consider\u00a0using the directional pad to move. It's great for lining up dashes!</li></ul>\n<p>This is a game I made in just under seven days for Bullet Hell Jam 2022. Everything except for the music (credited below and in-game)\u00a0is either a built-in Unity package or was made by me during the jam period.</p>\n<p>Please forgive the lack of a browser version; I was unable to get the sound quality up to an acceptable level in WebGL mode during the jam period.
