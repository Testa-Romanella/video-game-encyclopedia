{"id": 418413, "slug": "syneseigeia", "name": "SyneSEIGEia", "name_original": "SyneSEIGEia", "description": "<p>This game was made in under a week for a game jam in which the theme was Synesthesia.</p>\n<p>Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense (for example, hearing) is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor.<br/></p>\n<p>More info on Synesthesia</p>\n<p>This game uses the concept that some people with synesthesia see letters associated with specific colours (for example: A = Red, B = Blue, C = Yellow). Although some will associate different colours to others,\u00a0\u00a0there are\u00a0most common colours experienced by English speaking synaesthetes. This is what I\u00a0have used to colour-code the letter keys.</p>\n<p>In theory if you have synesthesia then this game should be easy!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A Game by STUART LILFORD</p>\n<p>Exotic Battle by KEVIN MACLEOD<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3729-exotic-battle<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:45:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e403e86b3b45a99cb44e97fed5f78b51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scared Square Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
