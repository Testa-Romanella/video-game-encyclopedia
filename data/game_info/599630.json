With the goal being to reach the end of the scene holding the 'grenade' the whole time.</p>\n<p>April's project was about making the players hyper-aware of their input. I wanted to make a project that forced the player to constantly be aware of their input and slipping up results in failure. I hoped to do this by forcing the player to constantly perform an action that inhibits their ability to complete the game.</p>\n<p>The materials I used for this project are the 'Gridbox Prototype Materials' by Ciathyza.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T07:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a35fb8eb95ac4a39ccee8cf02420c74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["APC Tophat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
