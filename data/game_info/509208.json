{"id": 509208, "slug": "zumo", "name": "Zumo", "name_original": "Zumo", "description": "<p>Zumo\u00a0is a 3D party game, where players must compete to rule the animal kingdom. Up to 4 players could choose from a roster of six animals \u2013 each with different stats and abilities \u2013 and battle on six unique boards. The goal is to be the last animal standing, by knocking other players off the edge, using your animal\u2019s unique abilities as well as a variety of pickups.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------</p>\n<p>On the 'Ready Up' screen, press the trigger on your side of the controller (or the SPACE and RSHIFT keys if using a keyboard) to confirm your controls. Each player uses their analog stick or key controls to select an animal to play as and vote on the map they'd like to play.</p>\n<p>While doing battle, hold the CHARGE button to power up your charge, then release to dash forward. You can rotate your animal while powering up in order to control the direction at which it will charge. Pressing down the analog stick will activate your animal's ability, but be careful how you use it since you can only do so once per round.</p>\n<p>When in game, any player can use the START button or ESC key to pause.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:58:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78d01446daae73f74ddc6b50f6f0d0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AbominableToast"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
