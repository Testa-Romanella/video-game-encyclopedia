A modest operation with a caring- albeit doltish- owner at the head who only communicates via phone to provide the courier with his jobs. <br/>Times are not easy and payouts are moderate to say the least but if you work hard, you can keep the lights on in your apartment- heck, you may even be able to finally get new wallpaper or an actual bed. <br/>If you desire to be better at your job, visit the gym to improve your stamina and keep yourself refreshed while working lest you have to plod to every delivery location. <br/></p>\n\n<br/><strong>Minimum</strong><strong>Recommended</strong><strong>Operating System</strong>Windows 7 64-bit<br/>Windows 10 64-bit<strong>Processor</strong>Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster.Intel 9700k or AMD\u00a03700X\u00a0processor.<strong>Memory</strong>8GB RAM<br/>16GB RAM<br/><strong>Video Card</strong>NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher.NVIDIA GTX 1650 or AMD Radeon RX 570 series card or higher.\r\n\n\n<p><strong>Voice</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Joseph Griffiths - The Courier</li><li>All other voices preformed by Schirwindt</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Art</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lunamiste</li><li>Luiza Ocker</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>All music\u00a0is\u00a0original\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0exception\u00a0of Crazy Prices by Phil McClean (Used with permission from the artist)</li></ul>\n\n<p>The streets and alleys are silent, many people live in this city- yet all of them are alone- If you are interested in learning more about the world of The Courier, have a look at Chesnakisnak on Steam.
