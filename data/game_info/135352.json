I\u00a0made it for all who would love it hook, line, and sinker.\u00a0There is no goal, no timer, no conflict, no score. But plenty to uncover, discover and explore. A Philosopher's Toy Box is, well, \u00a0a toy. One for every tinkerer to enjoy. Experiment with its mechanics. Wrestle with its metaphysics. But, please, don't obsess over the unfinished specifics. (After all, this is only a prototype.)</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys - MOVE</p>\n<p>Mouse - INTERACT</p>\n<p>Esc - RESTART/SAVE</p>\n<p>C - CHANGE COLOR SCHEME</p><p>Space - ????</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a32/a3251a8e4188274a950f049feec56d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ian Schiffman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
