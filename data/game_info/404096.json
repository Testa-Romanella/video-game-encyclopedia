Skill will matter because of the combo score multiplier; don't let the timer reach zero between eating apples and you slowly build score multiplier making each apple be worth more points.</p>\n<p>There is also an element of luck. You might encounter rainbow apples and they are worth a lot!</p>\n<p>Best is of course a combination of luck and skill. If you have a high score multiplier when the rainbow apple appears you get the really high scores.</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<ul><li>The snake moves on it's own but keep the arrow pressed in the direction the snake is heading to activate turbo mode.</li><li>To make a sharp U-turn hold down the arrow key in the opposite direction the snake is travelling and then quickly tap up or down, if it's travelling sideways, or left or right if it's travelling vertically</li><li>You can hit Enter to start the game.</li></ul>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T03:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fdc9eaa20dd9658983e286bb3ac5ce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rayben"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
