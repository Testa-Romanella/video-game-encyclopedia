Turrets also require maintenance, however they do defend themselves and you. </p><p> Gather Orange and Red Vectors to build and repair. </p><p>Originally built back in 09 I have updated and revamped this a bit to work on 19:9 aspect screens,. apparently back in 09 I was still working on an old 4:3 type display,. also added a couple of SunVox music tracks to give a bit more atmosphere.  send a few bucks when you download for development costs and perhaps I will be able to fix bugs, add levels, progression, and more fun stuff to this,. thanks for playing ;)   </p><p>the LATEST version has keyboard ONLY controls, no mouse needed. (for laptops)</p><p>WASD or ARROWS to move<br/></p><p>JL to aim/rotate</p><p>IK to fire/repair</p><p>Keyboard/Mouse or Gamepad controls are still available.</p><p>Game-play difficulty tweaked, much easier to clear the current level.</p><p>Level generation more random, no longer are all nodes on grid, and more spread out overall. nodes die much quicker, 3 shots? Player shot energy consumption way down,. from 6-7 shots to 30-50 from full charge.</p><p>Music changed to a more cinematic piece for the game-play,. title music the same.  Still some bugs and hard crashes,. two sound systems perhaps I will move the effects over and unify the synthesis. </p><p>Replaced sadly broken version; uninstall and re-download. (whole download is less than 500k)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3bf84527225ea37e8891ca39bc408e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
