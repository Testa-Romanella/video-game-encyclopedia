It's simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master.  This game's rogue-like exterior belies clever puzzle design and unique play mechanics that provide amazing depth.  Each room is a hand-crafted puzzle that you solve by clearing out all the monsters with your Really Big Sword without letting any reach and kill you. Monster types each have their own AI, with deterministic movement patterns. Puzzle elements and terrain types help and hinder you in solving each puzzle. You start by learning basic mechanics and fighting techniques, and then the difficulty steadily ramps up as each room you face presents a fresh challenge with a logical solution. This game features a novel play style, with story- and puzzle-driven voiced dialogue delivered inline with hardcore puzzle solving that involves a mix of strategy, tactics, lateral thinking and linchpins.

Gunthro is a third-generation smitemaster and a rather ugly man. Smitemasters are hard-bitten, muscled veteran dungeon exterminators that slay hideous beasties in dark places for a living. You know Gunthro will get the job done, and you'll happily pay him to clear your basement of giant man-eating dungeon roaches.<br/><br/>When the Rasarun king is slain by an officer of Tueno, Gunthro is recruited by Rasarus to defend his country and reclaim its honor. However, as Gunthro searches deeper, he will find that things are not quite as they seem.<br/><br/>Experience the unique turn-based puzzle dungeon adventure of DROD!<br/><br/><strong>Deluxe Bundle:</strong><br/>Contains:<br/><ul><li>DROD: Gunthro and the Epic Blunder<br/></li><li>DROD OST: Deadly Music of Death, Volumes 1 and 2</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd1/dd1db2955bce2c3e22edce28de2fc934.jpg", "website": "http://www.caravelgames.com", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 78, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 300, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Caravel Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Caravel Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
