In this game, you play as the last Dwarven wizard, attempting to travel to the Elven lands to retrieve the crystals that they have stolen, thus draining the magic from the rest of your city. It's up to you to restore your city to it's former glory! Good luck, adventurer.</p>\n<p>Sorry for such little content, I\u00a0didn't quite leave myself enough time to add any more haha.
