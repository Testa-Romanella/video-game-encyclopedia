And although it might be useless on it's own, it has a secret up his sleeve.</p>\n<p>This game was made for VimJam2. The Requirement was \"Boss\" and the\u00a0 theme is on the edge.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game where you play as the other side from a boss battle. So instead of having levels and power ups , you get \"phases\", if you drop below 0 hp, instead of dying you change phases, upgrading your abilities and stats. But don't overdo it, boss die too eventually.</p>\n<p>For the theme, I've created a mechanic that allows you to absorb enemy abilities if you get really close to their attacks.</p>\n<p>This is my first complete game so any feedback is heavily appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for play and good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T09:00:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23cb8e8c6de13448969cbddc0ed3dd9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
