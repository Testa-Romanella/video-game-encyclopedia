I added 4 different selectable characters, 3 of which have unique abilities that can be used to avoid the ghosts and get those pellets.</p>\r\nGhost Behaviour\r\n<p>This is the normal behaviour for each ghost:</p>\n<ul><li>Red - Chases the player</li><li>Blue - Runs away from the player</li><li>Green - Moves randomly throughout the level</li><li>Pink - Moves clockwise around the level</li></ul>\n<p>When the power-up pellet is eaten, each ghost adopts the behaviour of the blue ghost (i.e. it runs away from the player)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/488d5c39d67f9aad3cc7f8ab33491c86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pheaton"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
