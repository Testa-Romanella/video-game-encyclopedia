{"id": 763159, "slug": "boxing-combat-itch", "name": "Boxing Combat (itch)", "name_original": "Boxing Combat (itch)", "description": "<p>Boxing Combat is a 2D-Boxing, arcade game, fighting game. This game is inspired by games like mortal Kombat, Scott\u2019s pilgrim vs the world and street fighter.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You will play a son of a boxer, the starting level you will play as the father, but this will be his final fight as he is killed during the match. His son then learns and becomes a boxer to get revenge. My idea for the mechanics is this, the 2 fighters will always be close together so there will be no movement when it comes to walking around, however I want to make it a 5-button game so it can also be played on mobile. What I mean by 5 buttons is 1 button to punch and the other is to move the torso back, forth, down and guard. Whichever direction you are holding at the time will be what type of punch you throw for example, if you hold \u201cS\u201d or down then the punch button you will do an uppercut, if you don\u2019t hold any direction and press the punch button it will just be a normal jab.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T20:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f50afafde9c9c35ecf117cb747de8cf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KayB_Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
