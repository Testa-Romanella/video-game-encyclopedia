In this interactive artistic experience, you will be asked to question the very facets of identity, discovering for yourself the fallacy of systemic profiling alongside the vibrancy of life. We hope that by resonating with the heartbeats of others, you will become acutely aware of your own, recognising the gentle beauty of the vital pulse we share.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T16:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/148/148b6a6240e6639ebf1ac0602ae9f2f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Memodol"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
