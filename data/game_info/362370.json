With this one, there is only one thing you can interact with, and that's one, single, lonely button. Expect a lot of clicking. This would expanded further if I didn't have life things to deal with, but I'm happy with what I've shown here as a tech demo of sorts. Made in Clickteam Fusion 2.5 with about 4-6 hours of work put in.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T02:54:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba9/ba9074a3e839384e6ff91b3d197fffb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delta eGirl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
