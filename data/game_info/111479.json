Oh! Ice cream! Yes! We're definitely having some ice cream by the fountain.</p>\n<p>Come on, let's take a Walk in the Park!</p>\r\nWhat is this?\r\n<p>A Walk in the Park is a short game experiment,\u00a0inspired by <strong>Minimalistic Jam</strong>.</p><p>I wanted to explore minimalistic gameplay, instead of presentation like the jam revolves around. Essentially exploring\u00a0what makes playing a game interesting without the structure of rules and framework, in the same way we used to have fun as kids, playing outside.</p><p>The mechanics in here\u00a0and reasoning behind them are things that have been swimming around in my head for a while, ideas that I want to continue to exploer. But ultimately, I just really wanted to have a nice walk in the park, in the sun, after experiencing two and a half months of rain in Reykjav\u00edk!</p>How do I play?\r\n<p>Well, an XBox controller is recommended, though keyboard WASD + E will do just as well. oh and B (controller) or Shift will let you run, if you were wondering.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's enough words...</p>\n<p>Put your shoes on and let's go!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fd/4fd32f078aa86dd5c326ed317bd5a372.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["JoiSigurdss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
