But this exile to the Antarctic darkness was not the end of his work in game design. He told me in an email dated September 6 1998 that he had been working in secret on a new game. (He had limited access to a computer in Antarctica, and his work was conducted entirely with pencil and paper.)\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I turn now to this other work: the subterranean, the interminably heroic, the peerless. And\u2014 such are the capacities of man!\u2014 the unfinished. This work, perhaps the most significant game of our time, consists of a detailed design document detailing the single player mode, high score system, and basic control scheme of the 1979 arcade game Asteroids.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>He did not want to produce another</em> <em>Asteroids clone \u2014which is easy\u2014 but the Asteroids itself. Needless to say, he never contemplated a mechanical transcription of the original; he did not propose to copy it, and indeed the legalities of copyright precluded a reproduction of the code, art, and sound assets. In any case, he did not have access to the source code, and he hadn\u2019t actually seen an Asteroids</em><em> machine since the late 1980s.</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>\u2018My intent is no more than astonishing,\u2019 he emailed me from McMurdo in September of 1998 \u2018The final term in a theological or metaphysical demonstration\u2014the objective world, God, causality, the forms of the universe\u2014is no less previous and common than my famed game. The only difference is that the philosophers publish the intermediary stages of their labor in pleasant volumes and I have resolved to do away with those stages.' <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>[...]</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>[</em>Rains, Logg, and Walsh(The authors of the first Asteroids)<em>], for example, wrote:<br/>\u2018GAME OVER!\u2019 Written in 1979, this is merely an ending, limited by the computing power of the 6502 processor and reflecting the mundane arcade conventions of the time.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Menard, on the other hand, writes: \u2018GAME OVER!\u2019 The game is </em>over<em>. It is an astounding idea. Menard lived in a time when it was clear that games were no passing fad; thousands of games were being released each year, with no end in sight, and as for his Asteroids, a game could be restarted with the simple flick of a button. Yet Menard denies these obvious truths, and instead invites the player to live in a tiny, finite, self-contained ludic world, in which there are only asteroids, spaceships, aliens, and death everlasting. It is a meditation on the very nature of reality!</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>[...]</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Alas!
