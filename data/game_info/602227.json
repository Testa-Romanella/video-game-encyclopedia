There are sixteen tracks and eight playable characters. There are also six game modes to choose from.</p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>Being a simple mobile racer, CNK2&#39;s plot is very simple and pretty illogical. Once again, Nitros Oxide is attempting to turn the planet Earth into a concrete parking lot. This time, however, he skips his &quot;Survival of the Fastest&quot; game and proceeds with his plan immediately, now with Cortex and Ripper Roo backing him up. The first step of his plan is to deforest the bamboo groves which happen to be the home of Yaya Panda. Yaya calls on Crash and Coco for help, and so the bandicoots set off to race for the fate of the planet once again.</p>\n<p>Sourcre: Bandipedia</p>\n<p>Platform: Java Mobile Phones</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-11T17:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae501fbf06c05435423321304f31c0e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": [], "developers": ["IP4U"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Vivendi Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
