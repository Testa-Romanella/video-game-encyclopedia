Magica was not paying attention and headed straight for the pumpkin patch. They are not very smart. They will run blindly towards Magica - sometimes crushed against each other or tripping over pumpkin porridge. Click on the arrows to move, click on Magica to stay put to advance the pumpkins. Click button to use MAGIC when the pumpkins are closest or use the TELEPORT button to take you to a random location. You can also use the SUICIDE button to make your last fight or lure the pumpkins on their porridge. Save Magica!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21bf8975fc825d560e0c3ffeb6577ced.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emmanuel Lorand"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
