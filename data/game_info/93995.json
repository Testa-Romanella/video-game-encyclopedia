She vows to never again let her heart get broken: \"Next time I fall in love with a girl, I won't let her get away without telling her I love her!\"</p><p>Play from Susanne's point of view as she navigates difficult choices about romance and her life. The player will make choices that will teach Susanne the meaning behind queer romances, shyness, anxiety, bullying, ADHD, family, and the words, \"I love you.\"  </p><p>This Tyrano Builder developed visual novel is heavily text based. It should take about 1.5 hours to complete (2 if you want both endings). This version of the game features only one route, choppy programming, and <em>very</em> beta artwork. </p><p>If you like this game and want to learn about it's development ( or if you want to contact me regarding an error) please visit https://www.tumblr.com/blog/mysweetdaruma to learn more, or email me at mysweetdarumadev@gmail.com .
