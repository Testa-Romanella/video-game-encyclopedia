It was super fun even though I was three days\u00a0late to join.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Love\", so I wanted to work with the concept of Love Languages. I believe I could work better if I had more time, but I'm happy with the result so far.</p>\n<p>This game is still under development. I plan on fixing many things in the future. Please keep in mind that I had very little time to work and I definitely know what is missing! Thus I ask that you do not give complex feedbacks.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking\u00a0out my game! &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:27:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e316cfeb19369c45fe0e0160cf05f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Flowers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
