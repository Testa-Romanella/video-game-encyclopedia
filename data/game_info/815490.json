The end result is a polished game that will probably take you around one to two hours to complete, depending on your skill at the game.</p>\n<p>If you're curious about what it looked like back in 2014, there are two very early versions you can look at if you want to toss me some money.</p>\n<p>This has custom level support, but it requires that you hand edit an XML file. If you're interested in making levels by hand, let me know and I'll write up something explaining the format.</p><p>If you enjoyed this game, there are some other games in development with the same inspiration. The ones I'm aware of are Rat Race\u00a0and Rashtal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T06:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/0950d81382a9a7ec6993937afb7852d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kevin Hutchins"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
