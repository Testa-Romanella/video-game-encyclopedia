Welcome to my entry game for Ludum Dare 48.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As always it didn't go as planned. I started of with wasting 7-10 hours just because I wanted to start working on something..\u00a0</p>\n<p>As always, never ends well</p>\n<p>Found out later that I couldn't come up with a single idea for the game, so scraped the idea and came up with this bad boi instead.</p>\n<p>This is why one should plan before hand and not just wing it..\u00a0 Well you live and you learn ^^</p>\n<p>Anyhow, now i've landed with this little puppy after 26 hours roughly.</p>\n<p>Had more stuffed planned but didnt have time and my brain feels pretty fried, the last few hours where almost a standstill.</p>\n<p>Gameplay..</p>\n<p>Well the point of the game is to dig depeer and deeper in an neverending tunnel, with some help from you trusty robot friends. You can place down turrents and torches.</p>\n<p>Your turrents need energy to run, which you'll be able to keep track of by looking at your battery thats located in the spawn room right behinde you when you first spawn in.</p>\n<p>Next to it (left side) is a Generator, with needs coal and ice to generate more energy ofc.</p>\n<p>You gather materials from the rocks you turrents break.</p>\n<p>Keybinds</p>\n<p>Most keybinds you'll see on your lower left corner of you screen exept the one you place down stuff with (which is left-click)</p>\n<p>Then you have this one weird keybind that lets you place down torches(P) and (O) for turrent.</p>\n<p>I Belive thats all, thats for me Ludum Dare 48, see you next time! (Sorry for poor english, hheading to bed) Hope you enjoy, this small and short game :) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Thesand</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13c71a91ce832e6324b538f9ebbfaf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thesand"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
