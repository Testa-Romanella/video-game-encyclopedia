Someone is good at writing papers, someone quickly conveys information, another can be a leader and drag all the staff at breakneck speeds. But do not forget that there are people who are good and sit in the toilet for 300 hours. In short, you need to accept people who will work well with each other and support each other, as in a chemical reaction.
