The catch: each player can only shoot down one of the two types, so you have to depend on your cooperative partner.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project was to explore LOVE2D as an option for developing a 16-bit style MOBA, and to celebrate open source!</p>\n<p>Sounds produced on\u00a0BeepBox. Made using only hand-rolled asset and code, on an open-source framework. Inspired by the likes of Rockman and Risk of Rain. Fueled by coffee and bubble tea.</p>\n<p>Git:\u00a0https://github.com/fredriclam/love-fall-jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7bffa2aacc53346f793268f942e2da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fredriclam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
