You'll need to either kill them or avoid them on your way to the boat. You can use everything in your environment to help you, for example throw a rock somewhere to distract the zombies, or hide in the vegetation so they can't see you. Be aware that every move you make and every decision you take has consequences, and that the zombies have a very good hearing.</p>\r\nHow to play :\r\n<ul><li>ZQSD/Arrows to move</li><li>A to sprint</li><li>left shift to crouch</li><li>T / G to Take / Drop object</li><li>Left mouse button to use object</li><li>Right mouse button to hit with hands</li></ul>\n\r\nNOTE : currently the project is not complete at all, only a small number of objects are usable and there is no menu yet to choose the difficulty or restart (meaning that if you're stuck somewhere you need to close the game and re-open it). Also the performances in the built version are not good yet (at least on my machine).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T23:41:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64c1cba0b5079ec28b12585b66f19e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DHS5"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
