Our day-to-day is governed by strict regulations dictating the appropriate distance between men and women and the various ways in which they can and cannot interact. As a result, direct interpersonal contact has been painfully reduced...<br/><br/>In a society where male and female members must always be six feet apart, even dating requires authorization.<br/><br/>But not in these hallowed halls!<br/><br/>Can you keep a respectable distance with three dauntless heroines horning in on you? And in a world where distance relationships are the new normal, how long will you be able to keep yourself from getting up close and personal?<h3>CHARACTERS</h3><br/>Tsukasa Tono<br/>\u201cPeople who wish to date while at the academy have to apply for permission.\u201d<br/><br/>As president of the love audit club, Tsukasa has made it her personal mission to ensure all on-campus relationships are approved\u2014or rejected!\u2014in accordance with current gender segregation laws. Despite her dedication to the cause, this black-haired beauty has yet to experience love herself, instead letting her wild imagination read the lewd and obscene into even the most innocent of guy-girl situations. Just as she begins to despair, however, her childhood friend, Shun, transfers to the same academy and agrees to help her research sex and dating\u2014all in the name of science, of course.<br/><br/><br/>Arika Chikamori<br/>\u201cYou don't need to run! You're the only person I chase around like this, you know?\u201d<br/><br/>A flashy freshman and the ideological opposite of Tsukasa, this sass-mouthed blonde is a vocal opponent of the gender segregation laws. Arika believes all individuals should be free to love whomever, whenever, and wherever they want. It's no surprise, then, that a certain hands-on situation on her first meeting with Shun invites her to misunderstand him as a bold ally in her fight for free love. Only problem is, now she clings to him at every chance, much to his dismay...<br/><br/><br/>Miyuki Mitsumine<br/>\u201cI'm happy to lend you my chest whenever you need, Shun.\u201d<br/><br/>Also new to campus is Shun's buxom homeroom teacher, Miyuki. Gentle, kind, and well-loved by her students, she also happens to be... Shun's old babysitter from when he was a child?! It's been ten years since they've talked, but \"Ms. Mitsumine\" still seems to enjoy doting on him\u2014both on campus and off of it. In fact, whenever they're alone together, all sense of personal boundaries flies out the window, and her true feelings return to the surface...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T02:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197a7764110fad3fd74e3bad75629d05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ouchi Jikan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Shiravune"], "esrb_rating": null}
