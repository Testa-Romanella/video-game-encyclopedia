I'm glad we did it in time :)</p>\n<p>So yeah, as I summarized at the top this game's goal is to survive as long as possible to get a high score. A small tutorial is implemented in the game so you are able to learn how it works and what you do in the game is most of the time dodging or reflecting cannon balls to your enemy ships ^^</p>\n<p>Art by TheMeatman (Robin)<br/>Music by Chrisgamma (Christian K)<br/>Programmed by (me)\u00a0Lauriichan (Laura E)</p>\n<p>All assets (Art, Music and Code) as well as the Godot project can be downloaded or just viewed on Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T06:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64f577be6b492be7860ca2eeace64afa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lauriichan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
