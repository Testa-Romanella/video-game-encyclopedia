I'm here today with a short game created using some simple tutorials online and a bit of experimentation.  This is only my first time using Game Maker, so there's not much to it, but I figured I'd share it here and see if people like it.</p><p>It's a simple jump and move proof-of-concept platformer.  Nothing really more or less.  You can cling to the ceiling and slide along them, jumping off at more optimal times.  You can also collect the coin in every level for an added challenge, though it really doesn't do anything.</p><p>Controls</p><p>W/up/Space is jump</p><p>A/left moves left</p><p>D/right moves right</p><p>You can also hit 1-0 on the keyboard to switch between the 10 levels of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b1af712830245cf8d40526b7b7285db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamedawg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
