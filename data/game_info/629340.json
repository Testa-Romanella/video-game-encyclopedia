The new map is fully endless, the amount of enemies scale exponentially, I noticed that by wave 10 on the second map the game gets really, really long. The second map does unlock the bunny tower, so test it out as much you'd like, but I would recommending closing it manually once you're bored, there's no goal, it's just endless.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T12:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa2463b417f702583216dff137b4c326.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ToasterovenX"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
