So if you like the idea behind the controller maybe leave some feedbacks, so I can know if I work on\u00a0an eventual bigger, cleaner game with this controller, or if I trash this !</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>But this was also made with love, for the story is full of marshmallow... Guimauve in french, giving the game it's name.</strong></em></p>\n\n\r\nGuimoove's family. Those are unplayable \"characters\" tho\r\n\r\nSTORY :\r\n\n<p><strong>The most important in an unpolished prototype, the story :\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Guimoove, our hero, was a little teddybear living with his family. His color was pink, and his heart was pure.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>However, one night, he was captured and sent to a mysterious candy factory, which wanted to experiment on Guimoove to turn the teddy bear... Into a gummy bear.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>However, after a failed experiment on his body,\u00a0 Guimoove achieved a state between the teddy and the gummy, capable of stretching and sticking his body to other sticky, candy stuff.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>He used these new skills to screw the factory over, but sadly, as in every evil guy's lair, there's, like, a big saw going forward. Guimoove will have to use his new skills to evade from the factory.</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\nMoving around won't be THAT easy.\r\n\n\r\nCONTROLLER :\r\n\n<p><strong>Full-mouse controls.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Click on Guimoove, drag him to move him on a candy point, then drop him. That's all. Then repeat, as fast as you can.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Appreciate the omnipresent splurt sounds his gummy body makes when sticking to points.</strong></p>\n\n\r\nAs you drag &amp; drop him, Guimoove's body stretches, along with his hitbox. Apologies for the lame schematics.\r\n\n\r\nTHE TWIST :\r\n\n<p><strong>Yeah, well the screen's moving, so you'll have to call huge tracking FPS skills to always keep the mouse on Guimoove to select him. No fake, it's a good training for reflexes and aim.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't have much to say except, well, have fun.
