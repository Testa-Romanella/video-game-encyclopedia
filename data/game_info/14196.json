Find keys, open doors and search for the exit to this nightmare. But I need to let you know, it will try to deceive You as many times as it can.<br />\nWelcome to the metahorror experience, enjoy your stay!<br />\nPlease read carefully the explanation when beginning the game for the first time, it&#39;s really important to do so.<br />\nKNOWN BUGS AND FIXES<br />\nSome systems may require DirectX updates for the game to work;<br />\nForce your laptop to use your GeForce: Some computers have dual graphics cards such as an on-board Intel HD card and an Nvidia GeForce graphics card. The game might be using the &quot;wrong&quot; graphics card, and forcing the PC to use the other one on IMSCARED.exe can fix graphics issues;<br />\nWindows 10 often recognize IMSCARED.exe as a virus: this causes the game to refuse creating files;<br />\nThe game needs your root to be C:\\, other roots COULD give problems for the game to create files on the Desktop. At the time I write this, a solution to this issue is still to be found;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T02:06:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6b63780d8190227cdb8320b34dbcff.jpg", "website": "http://facebook.com/mymadnessworks", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 139, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ivan Zanotti's MyMadnessWorks", "Ivan Zanotti's MyMadness Works"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ivan Zanotti's MyMadnessWorks", "Ivan Zanotti's MyMadness Works"], "esrb_rating": null}
