{"id": 40013, "slug": "subversion", "name": "Subversion", "name_original": "Subversion", "description": "<p>Subversion is the name for a planned game from Introversion Software. It makes heavy use of procedurally generated content. A generator capable of building a model city, complete with buildings, roads and highways was demonstrated at an Imperial College Games and Media event. Development of the software is being documented in the Introversion Software blog. In May 2008, lead developer Chris Delay discussed the game in an interview with Eurogamer.<br />\nAccording to Chris Delay, he had always wanted to know what game developers went through when they developed games, so he made the approach with Subversion.<br />\nIn Subversion, the player takes on the role of a criminal mastermind orchestrating a theft from a secured building:<br />\n&quot;Subversion is going to be set in a modern High Tech environment, with you taking &quot;mission control&quot; over a team of skilled operatives in a hostile High Security building. You will be using Sabotage, Social Engineering and Grifting, custom Electrical and Mechanical devices, Distractions, Hacking, Stealth, Acrobatics, Precision demolitions, Trickery, whatever gets the job done. In the best case scenarios your enemies will never know you were even there. When things go wrong, a well prepared escape plan and well timed precision violence will get you out of a tight spot - or maybe not.&quot;<br />\nOn October 17, 2011 Introversion posted on their blog that the game has been put on hold as they had lost the focus of the gameplay which made them decide to focus their efforts on developing a new game. Subversion however is not canceled, and they&#39;ll return to it once they&#39;ll &quot;rethink [it] from top to bottom&quot;. Since then, it has been known through the Prison Architect art book that the game has since been canceled.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-02T12:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e5/4e56e4479b01697bda52a08cc32d9f68.jpg", "website": "http://www.introversion.co.uk/subversion/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Introversion Software"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
