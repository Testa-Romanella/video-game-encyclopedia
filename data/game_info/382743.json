The main objective of the game is to put the ball in the correct hole while avoiding the rest of the holes.<br/><br/>Super Korotama has several levels and modifiers that are unlocked when you beat all leves, such as an ice mode, bomb mode and dizzy mode. They will make the game even more complicated, but they will award you with more points to get a higher score in the world rankings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/><ul><li>Retro synthwave aesthetic<br/></li><li>2 different game modes<br/></li><li>20+ different challenging levels<br/></li><li>X3 mode modifications<br/></li><li>Different collectable power ups<br/></li><li>Integrated machine retro UI<br/></li><li>Synthwave jukebox</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T14:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd6/dd6d588821f861fc0e6813747f789f0a.jpg", "website": "http://catnessgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 95, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Catness Game Studios", "Catness Game"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Catness Game Studios", "Catness Game"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
