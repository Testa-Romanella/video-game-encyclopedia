It was ported to the PlayStation as Hellboy: Asylum Seeker, developed by Hoplite Research and released in 2004.</p>\n<p>The Hellboy game is based on Dark Horse Comics' science fiction comic book series Hellboy, written and drawn by Mike Mignola.</p>\n<p>Commercially, the game was not successful. Having spent four years in development, the graphics and game play were dated, and at the time of its release, Hellboy was still a mostly unknown independent comic book series, especially outside the United States. The PC version had numerous bugs, and the PlayStation version was graphically inferior to most others at the time (especially due to the very late 2004 release date for the PlayStation port, with sixth-gen systems released long before).</p>\n<p>Both Cryo Studios and Cryo Interactive went out of business shortly after Hellboy's PC release.</p>\n<p>The PC version has a score of 11.50% at GameRankings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e6440cacc4f754d96eac60c0de30abda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Hoplite Research", "Cryo Studios North America", "Cryo Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["DreamCatcher Interactive", "Cryo Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
