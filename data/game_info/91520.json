But when he's strapped for stones and in need of some fast cash, a seemingly easy retrieval job becomes much more than he bargained for. Now he's saddled with an insufferable mer who's only wish is to go home and get as far away from him as possible. The only way he's going to solve his problems is by selling the mer to the highest bidder. But can he really doom another soul to a fate he's been fighting against his whole life? Or will he finally give in and live up to his Noct heritage?</p><p>\n<strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/>\r\n\t-Female and Male Routes<br/>\r\n\t-9 different endings per character<br/>\r\n\t-A morality meter that tracks the decisions you make\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>RATING:</strong> 13+ for mild blood, violence and language.\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Please Note: This game was created for NaNoRenO 2015.
