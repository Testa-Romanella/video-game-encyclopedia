The objective is to reach the exit. Along the way, you must avoid the Daughters as they kill you.\u00a0 I use some sound effects from FreeSound, like the sound of wedding. People feel bored by bridesmaids sometimes, so I chose a aggressive piece of music from\u00a0www.incompetech.com\u00a0for the game. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary (by Mike)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stretch Bouquet Point</strong>\u00a0is a game designed by ANGELINA, an artificially intelligent piece of software designed by me, Michael Cook, an AI and Computational Creativity researcher. Stretch Bouquet Point\u00a0was ANGELINA's\u00a0<em>control</em>\u00a0entry into Ludum Dare 28 - \"You Only Get One\" - meaning we didn't tell people it was made by ANGELINA to try and see if people treated the entry differently.\u00a0You can read the paper I wrote about the process\u00a0here, and you can still see the Ludum Dare page, with rankings and comments,\u00a0here. You can also play the main entry,\u00a0<em>To That Sect</em>, on itch here.</p>\n<p>The interpretation ANGELINA latches onto here is marriage - the model of a woman is a bridesmaid, and the audio playing is from a marriage ceremony blessing (I think - it's been a few years since I tracked the origins down).</p>\n<p>If you'd like to know more about the research I do, or about ANGELINA, or anything related to us, you can find out more at\u00a0http://www.gamesbyangelina.org</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef4218c38b6af1a340cc982ae819b83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Games by ANGELINA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
