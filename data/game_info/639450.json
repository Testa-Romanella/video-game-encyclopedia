No dice or math is required, and instead everything unfolds through guided roleplay and the consent of each player.<br/></p>\n<p>It's fairly simple, and free to download (though donations are always appreciated) so why not just try it out yourself?</p>\n<p>If you play, let me know in the comments what you think!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T07:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/0173fc41938e2a2d50e3559d2e7b2979.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nyanarchist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
