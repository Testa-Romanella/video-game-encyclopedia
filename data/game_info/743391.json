Villagers are here required to bring offerings to the God every day in exchange for the God&#39;s protection. It&#39;s heard that if anyone broke this rule or ate the offering, the village would be attacked by the evil spirits and devastated in the end. But no one has ever done that so no one knows if that is real. I guess that is just a very old rumour, old enough to be forgotten by the God himself maybe. Oops, did I mention that today it&#39;s my family&#39;s turn to provide offerings? I&#39;d better go now...&quot;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T14:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5daa206595cff911c7ef48f6f20031c5.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/5913/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
