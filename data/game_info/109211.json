As part of you training you are tasked with using your powers to create gale clouds to move a ship to the goal. Beware, for there are obstacles in your path that will send you all the way back to where you started if you touch them. Good luck trainee.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\nGoal\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the ship to the end. You do this by having the wizard\u00a0spawn gale clouds at points around the ship.\u00a0</p>\r\nPlayer Character\r\n<p>The player consists of a wizard (a small white figure), and the ship (colored red). Around the ship is a ring resembling a compass. This ring indicates the different points that the wizard can be placed.</p>Player Actions<p><strong>Position Wizard:</strong> The wizard is able to be placed at different points on the compass ring. The wizard can only be placed at one of eight points on the compass ring. These points correspond to the cardinal positions.\u00a0 You can combine position inputs to position the wizard at North West, North East, South West, or South East.</p><p><strong>Spawn Gale Cloud:\u00a0</strong>Clouds are spawned at the current position of the wizard. When a cloud is spawned it blows wind to the center of the compass ring. The winds combine to move the ship . Up to three clouds can be present at a time.</p><p><strong>Dispel Gale Cloud:</strong> When wizard tries to spawn a cloud at a position that already has a cloud, the position is cleared of clouds. In other words, spawning on a cloud dispels the cloud.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>W : Position at North</p>\n<p>A : Position at West</p>\n<p>S : Position at South</p>\n<p>D : Position at East</p>\n<p>Space : Spawn a cloud at current position / Dispel the cloud at current position</p>\n<p>Esc: Exit the game</p>\r\nThings to Note\r\n<p>This is currently a prototype build and is bound to be full of bugs.\u00a0</p><p>The ship rotates erratically at times when changing movement direction.</p><p>The game closes once you get to the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7e/a7ec6c865d98fffb496c0279874886c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dumarq"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
