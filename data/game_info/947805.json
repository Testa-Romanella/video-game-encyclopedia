There is also a Golden Dorito that appears randomly and gives you extra points and extra time, but it moves faster and faster as you progress, challenging you to catch it.</p>\n<p>- We improved the compatibility and performance of the game by adding JavaScript and CSS code to make it sleeker and more user-friendly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T13:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea50783b81318edaae07973551a1cade.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["legionkingz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
