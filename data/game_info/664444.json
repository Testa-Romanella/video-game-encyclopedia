There is an interesting being... </p>\n<p>A being that hosts a tournament for the strong. They call it The Dark Lord.</p>\n<p>For what purpose does it host a tournament? Who knows. Some say it enjoys the sight of young blood being spilled. Some say it is for some other, unknown motives.</p>\n<p>Obviously The Dark Lord knew that no one would simply go ahead and spill their blood for him... so he offered a reward.<br/></p>\n<p>A wish.

It's been inspired by multiple game series that I am deeply in love with. So you will likely spot a lot of similarities to some action games out there. (Mainly Devil May Cry). <br/></p>\n<p>Either way. I hope you will enjoy what I have so far.<br/></p>\n<p>-<br/></p>\n<p>Future:</p>\n<p>This project has been in developement for a few long months, I work on it during my spare time as I have a normal daytime job. I feel like it is polished enough to be showcased to the world... Hopefully you'll enjoy what I have so far.</p>\n<p>This is simply a demo. A full game is being in developement and will be sold on Steam in the future.</p>\n<p>I shall not disclose the scope of the game as everything is a subject to change, but don't expect anything extremely big. Have fun!<br/></p>\n<p>-<br/></p>\n<p>Demo:</p>\n<p>The demo contains 2 levels, and first 20 floors of the Tower Of Blood.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Gamepad: <br/></p>\n<p>360/Xone/XOX Partially supported, only during the gameplay for now. Full implementation will be done in the final release of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Want to help this game?
