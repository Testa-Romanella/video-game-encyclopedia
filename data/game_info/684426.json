The challenging combat encounters can only be beaten as a team and by mastering the game's combo combat system.</p>\n<p>We wanted to make a game that captures the feeling of going on an adventure and beating the forces of darkness together with a friend, and that's what Aska &amp; Nazuki is: <br/><br/>A game about two women traveling a lost world, fighting their way through hordes of enemies, descending into the dark. They will only survive if they manage to fight as a team, combining each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This game is not a singleplayer game! It can only be played with two players on the same PC (aka Couch Co-op), using gamepads. <br/><br/>Aska &amp; Nazuki was made in 2020 by 4 students as part of our studies in Game Design (BA) at DE:HIVE / HTW Berlin. It's a vertical slice, so don't expect hours of gameplay. ;)<br/><br/>Team:<br/>Alex Mejda - Programming &amp; Game Design<br/>Cyrill Callenius - Programming &amp; Game Design<br/>Kristina Fitzner - 2D Art, UI &amp; Game Design<br/>Marlene Holly - Art, Animations, VFX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/311/3116c43b7c49126fe0ed9a6c3f67a511.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex Mejda"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
