{"id": 571809, "slug": "math-analogies-level-2", "name": "Math Analogies Level 2", "name_original": "Math Analogies Level 2", "description": "Standards-based analogies that teach analogical and mathematical reasoning. <br/><br/>Analogies occur in life and frequently in high-stakes tests. Understanding analogies and the ability to reason analogically (reasoning used to identify, evaluate, and solve an analogy) are important problem-solving skills which are an essential part of mathematical development. The immediate benefit is to recognize and solve simple analogies. The long-term benefits are improved reasoning skills that enable students to break problems into their component parts, recognize analogies embedded in arguments, and evaluate them.<br/><br/>The 152 analogies in this program teach students to break problems down into their component parts, making it easier to recognize familiar formats that enable students to produce solutions. These analogies are designed around the grade-appropriate standards identified by the National Council of Teaching Mathematics.<br/><br/>This app has won several awards including the Creative Child Magazine 2014 Media of the Year Award in the Educational Software Category, the Dr. Toy Best Smart Play / Smart Toy Product, the iParenting Media Award, and the iParenting Media Excellent Products Award!<br/><br/>Grades: 4th-5th (Ages 9-11)<br/>Subject: Mathematics<br/>Authors: Linda and Doug Brumbaugh<br/><br/>Features<br/>     - 152 analogies<br/>     - 4 attempts to complete game<br/>     - Multi-user login<br/>     - Keeps track of scores<br/>     - Saves unfinished attempts<br/>     - Ad-free<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/>Do you enjoy this app?
