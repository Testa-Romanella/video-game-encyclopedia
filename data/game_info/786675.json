For just once, on a day that wasn't a birthday, there would be a time where they could all be together...<br/><br/>But, wishes always work in strange ways, don't they?\r\n<p>Fragments of the Past is a small Renpy game I built on a whim to get myself back into making games. It's based around a character for a tabletop game, so it's definitely not something I\u00a0tried especially hard to make readable for those who don't know the character? Still, it was a lot of fun to make! Thank you if you read it ^-^)</p>\n<p>The content warning list is fairly small but expect: character death, various tension (family and otherwise), but there's no graphics that depict anything spooky.
