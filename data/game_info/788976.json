We are Crabertay, a team of eight game students currently studying at Abertay University.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Our group was formed in 2021 where we worked together on our game Crab Crab Revolution. We were one of the six finalists\u00a0in Abertay\u2019s DARE Academy,\u00a0where we created Beats of Dischordia. Some members of the team then took part in the Global Game Jam 2022 to create Slime CatZzz Chess and now we are once again working together to develop <em>Training for Disaster</em> for CDAC Network.</p>\r\nOverview\r\n<p><em>Training for Disaster</em> is a prototype proof of concept game for use as a training tool, developed for humanitarian response staff to improve the use of <em>communication, community-engagement, and accountability</em> (CCEA) with communities affected by disasters, conflicts, and displacement around the world.<br/></p>\n<br/>\r\nMore Information\r\nPlaying as an NGO\r\n<p>NGO staff can practice their newly learnt community engagement skills in a safe, virtual environment that allows trainers to assess their ability. Upon entering the game, you are given tasks to complete. It is your job to fulfil the needs of tasks assigned to you in a way you think is most appropriate to the given situation. This may be achieved by navigating the camp; interacting with <em>AP</em> players and Non-Playable Characters (NPCs); relaying this information back to headquarters; and carrying out the necessary final actions for the task.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are two major tasks in this prototype:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>For the first task, your NGO has provided funding to improve an existing facility or to build a new building within the camp. It is your job to determine which building should receive funding by talking with APs in the camp.\r\n    </li><li>For the second task, you need to implement a cash distribution plan for families in the camp so they can buy the things they need, from food to clothes. By communicating with APs, you need to assess what the camp thinks about this, and how you would best distribute cash to families who need it most.</li></ul>\r\nPlaying as an Affected Person\r\n<p>You are a resident of the disaster-relief camp performing a daily routine, completing basic tasks such as:      Collecting water;     Tidying away bags of garbage;     Selling food at the market;     Helping other APs.    The purpose of this role is to allow humanitarian staff to experience a first-hand view of their colleagues\u2019 performance as NGO Workers in the context of the game. Integral to this, trainees get to experience how the level and type of community-engagement affects their experience as an AP. This\u00a0gameplay dynamic is a crucial element of the game, as it forms the basis of a rich learning experience between APs and NGOs. Feedback between parties, with guidance from trainers, allows trainers and trainees to ascertain the efficacy of community engagement actions.</p>\n\r\nInformation About Design\r\n<p>This tool is designed to be accessible to those with very little to no experience with video games and is best suited to being played in a controlled environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out our gameplay video:</strong></p>\n\r\nCrabertay\r\n<p><strong>Adam Smith:</strong> Technical Art, QA Tester</p>\n<p><strong>Aleks King:</strong> Narrative Programmer, QA Lead\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Flinn:</strong> Level Design,\u00a0User Interface Design</p>\n<p><strong>Emily Collins:</strong> 3D Artist, Narrative Writer</p>\n<p><strong>Jaqueline Sweetin:</strong> 3D Artist, Animator,\u00a0User Interface Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Justin Syfrig</strong><strong>:</strong> Lead Programmer\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Lyes Oussaiden:</strong> Producer, Audio Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Niko Drousie:</strong> Lead Designer, Programmer</p>\n\n<p><strong>Academic Tutor:</strong> Martin Lynagh</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager:</strong>\u00a0FanMan Tsang</p>\n<p><strong>Testers:\u00a0</strong>Ailish Reyes,\u00a0Eve Baillie,\u00a0Gregor Crawford</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks:\u00a0</strong>Alyssa Thurston,\u00a0Andrew Reid,\u00a0Gareth Robinson,\u00a0Giano Libot,\u00a0Hannah Bass,\u00a0Judith Hall,\u00a0Robin Griffiths</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inkle:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Joystick Pack:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mirror:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wwise: </strong>Powered by Wwise \u00a92006,\u00a02022 Audiokinetic Inc.
