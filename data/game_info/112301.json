At the time I\u00a0was trying to make a narrative game but I was getting stuck on all the details of gameplay and visuals. I wanted something that was just about making a place you could be in with people you could talk to, and I ended up making bitsy. At first there was no user interface, just a text file you could edit to change the room and sprite data. In fact, I did that on purpose so I could edit it on my phone's note app on the bus. So these first 3 games I\u00a0made were mostly tapped out on my phone's keyboard! Maybe that's why they're so tiny.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was one of the first three games made while I was developing\u00a0bitsy (a free game making tool). They are:</p>\n<ul><li>When\u00a0I get home</li><li>September is halfway over\r\n</li><li>In the middle of the night</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2a/b2a998440fa49c51d7b0f8a1b4bbeae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adam Le Doux"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
