{"id": 29505, "slug": "tetcolor", "name": "Tetcolor", "name_original": "Tetcolor", "description": "tetColor is a puzzle game that puts a new spin on the Tetris\u00ae* concept.<br/><br/>Build clusters of minimum 4 blocks of the same color which are then removed. Removing more than 4 blocks at once drop you receive some extra points. The score grows when you remove blocks of different color at the time. We suggest to build the combinations where more blocks and colors are removed at one drop.<br/><br/>The game starts slowly and speeds up with the time (what is indicated by the level). The higher level is the more color are used (up to 6). The game stops when the field is filled and there is no room for the new items to appear. The next item is displayed bellow the current level.<br/><br/>Game controls:<br/>* Slide the screen left or right to move item.<br/>* Slide the screen up to rotate item colors.<br/>* Slide the screen down to drop item.<br/><br/>For better control, we suggest: Put a finger on the screen and move it left or right to move item; Do not release the finger! Slide up to rotate colors if needed; Do not release the finger! Slide down to drop item and release the finger.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/>Our players also like: Tetris, BreakThru.<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/>* Tetris is a registered trademark of Electronic Arts Inc.
