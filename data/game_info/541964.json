Clefairy will deal more damage as more of them are placed.</p>\n<p>Ariados\u00a0- The lowest damage Defender, but the movement of targets will be reduced. Ariados will not attack a target whose speed has already been reduced.</p>\n<p>Claydol - Able to attack multiple targets but at a reduced power.</p>\n<p>Swalot - Deals low damage, but will inflict Poison and deal damage over time. Swalot will not attack a target who is already Poisoned.</p>\n<p>Scyther - Attacks quickly and ignores an amount of the target's Defense.</p>\n<p>Gardevoir - Attacks will reduce the target's Special Defense for a short time.</p>\n<p>Dusknoir - Attack power increases for each effect active on the target.</p>\n<p>Machoke - Short range but powerful, attacks will reduce the target's Defense.</p>\n<p>If an attacker reaches your chosen legendary Pok\u00e9mon then they will be defeated, however this will also consume a portion of your Berries!</p>\n<p>If your defenses are about to be breached it may be better to place one last unit to save yourself, the greatest rewards can only be gained by coming close to defeat!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d1/5d1dc4e17b64f490e35c4c59e0faf67a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Private Prinny"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
