You need to be on the lookout for people who don't pass 'the vibe check' and don't let them in, otherwise they'll ruin the fun. BUT you need to be quick, the clubbers are waiting! And no one likes to wait!</p>\n<p>If you leave them outside the management won't be happy and you'll lose your job. Have fun Bob!<br/></p>\n<p>Originally made as a mobile game for a 24h game jam.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0\u00a0Daniil Skrendo, Ekaterina Smirnova, Julia Cie\u015blicka, Bartosz Przyby\u0142ek, Oskar Bie\u0144ko, Bartosz Budka.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:44:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53a/53a5daca2d12dd7d0311af2cb4c2418d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bartosz Przyby\u0142ek", "tooManyDogs", "Froztbite", "poxodi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
