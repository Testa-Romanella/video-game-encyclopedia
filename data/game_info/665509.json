It won't work properly in a naturally lit room! The webcam is used for gameplay purposes only - nothing is recorded, and the game has no ability to save any data, including images.</p><p>When playing in a desktop\u00a0browser, using Chrome is recommended to ensure access to the webcam. The game currently doesn't work in any tested mobile browser.</p>\n<p><em>Switch Off </em>features some vulgar imagery including brief examples of cartoon nudity. Nothing worse than you might expect to see on an unattended whiteboard in a high school classroom\u00a0- much of the information we absorb on a daily basis is vulgar in one way or another in any case.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:26:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee313e6db0d6347273dee3a5d4cc6161.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TomBattey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
