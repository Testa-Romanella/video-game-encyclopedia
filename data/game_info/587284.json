(Double Dash)", "description": "<p>Bounce is a Roguelike Topdown Shooter where your Bullets don't do damage.</p>\n\n<p>In Bounce, in order to damage the enemy, you have to make your bullet hit a wall first, making it bounce off of it. If your bullet bounces 1 time, then hits an enemy, it does one damage. If the bullet hits the wall 20 times, it does 20 damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also catch the bullet again by walking into it. Catching a bullet that has already been bounced 10 times for example, means that your next Bullet can be thrown at the enemy directly, dealing 10 damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The enemies don't do damage, but you need to kill them in order to explore the next room. The goal of the game is to get through the dungeon as fast as possible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0WASD</p>\n<p>Shoot:\u00a0left mouse button</p>\n<p>Restart:\u00a0R</p>\n<p>Quit the game:\u00a0Escape</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T08:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa80b75fee09b5cdd80dedb58c8b1073.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Double Dash"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
