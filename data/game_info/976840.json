Want in?<br/><br/><h3>Calling all Bounty Hunters</h3>Build your own party of irresponsible misfit heroes and delve into an epic world story with the ultimate goal of... avoiding needing to work retail. Armed with guns, magic, and a distracting amount of leg, hop aboard your spaceship for adventure.<br/><br/><h3>Form your unique team</h3>Mix &amp; match skills from the comfort of your spaceship's hanger. <br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Turn Based Combat</h3>Assemble your crew and whoop some baddies in fun &amp; fast combat.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Villains that are almost as bad as the Heroes</h3>Big bounties await! Those villains aren't gonna bring themselves in. And worse... if they do, you won't get paid. <br/><br/><br/><h3>A story of high (and very low) adventure</h3>Akumi's path is fraught with unusual creatures, supernatural horrors, and friendships that will last (a very short) lifetime. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Follow and wishlist Akumi Wars</h3>Join us as we finish Akumi Wars. Keep your eyes on the news here for the latest and be sure to follow and wishlist. It is the best way to help us get the word out there about what we are building.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T09:16:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f4/6f4865f2eb7d0af861283249bc572a7d.jpg", "website": "https://www.akumiwars.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miltonius Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Miltonius Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
