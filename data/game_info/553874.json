I made this game a long time ago but never published it because I was driving the game to far, and in theory this game is just an endless runner, which is a thing that I don't want to develop that far. It was a fun experience when I was excited about it, but 3 months passed and I still had this game lying in my Unity Game Library. The game needed few things to be kinda completed. I learned a lot of coding and game design on those 3 months, and looking to my code and design choices that I made, gave me even less desire to work on the game. I removed a lot of things and just adjusted some of them and now the game is playable. Despite all of this, it was still a fun project and I've learned a lot! If you want to play the game there are some simple rules:</p>\n<p>SPACE - Jump</p>\n<p>A - Attack</p>\n<p>YOU CAN'T KILL GHOSTS!</p>\n<p>YOU CAN ONLY KILL KNIGHTS (those grey thingies haha) FROM THE TOP!</p>\n<p>Have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/332/332a06bb0ff0c496796297efe246ee49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Waive"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
