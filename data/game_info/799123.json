The player is tasked with navigating Faby through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. Faby automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the space key. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:37:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc4/dc453fa84960da7a26aaccebc13b0f15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["omar732"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
