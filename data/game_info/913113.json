I had a blast working on this over the weekend, I hope you take the time to play and tell me what you think. It was a wild ride, and I definitely didn't finish, the game is pretty rough, a number of bugs, minimal feedback indicators, glaring lack of audio (sorry) and no balance. But I think its kinda fun nonetheless and I may fix some of the bugs and polish it up a bit over the next couple weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>note: v0.3 was uploaded a few minutes after deadline, with a few bug fixes.</p>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<p>Unreal Engine 5.1</p>\n<p>Assets:</p>\n<p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/aeb6e6adbd14449997e14975c66c...<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-lost-ruins-kit<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/undead-pack-01</p>\n<p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/material-function-collect...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:30:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/268cc0e56e07663305265e596d0c407c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["linkwin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
