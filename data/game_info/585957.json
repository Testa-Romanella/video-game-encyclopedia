If you wish to play those games first, here's the links:</p>\n<p>Skelltuns by Happy Frog Games (itch.io)</p>\n<p>Skelltuns 2 by Happy Frog Games (itch.io)<br/></p>\n<p>That being said, I don't personally mind the idea of you playing those games spoiled on what's already in them.</p>\n<p>Maybe it detracts from the surprise of the games a bit, but the only game I spoil particularly substantially here is 2, which is a rather short game to begin with that basically entirely lacks any kind of plot, unlike this game and the first one.</p>\r\nOVERVIEW:\r\n<p>It has been many long, painful, agonizing hours since Skelltuns 2 released. You've been waiting for a sequel since April 1st, 2021. It is now April 2nd, 2021. The wait was painful. You could barely hang in there for it. But your wait has not gone unrewarded.</p>\n<p>This is it! The sequel you've been waiting for!</p>\n<p>Skelltuns 3:\u00a0The Long-Awaited Threequel is, like \"Skelltuns 2: Garden Tomes\", a game that you play.</p>\n<p>And a weird game.</p>\n<p>This is the largest Skelltuns yet! It is a more linear game than Skelltuns 1 and 2 were, but it is made up for by how much more there is to do overall and by how there is still exploration.</p>\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\n<p>Skelltuns 3 is a game that you play.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Oh, you want to know more.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:\u00a0This is your final warning for spoilers on Skelltuns 1 and 2, since I will be describing the core gameplay of both games, and more-or-less spoiling the entirety of Skelltuns 2.\u00a0(...personally, I don't mind people going in spoiled, but some people might mind, this is more for your sake than mine.) If you wish to play those games without knowing much about them, this is your last chance!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, Skelltuns 1 was a game about exploring a large hub and playing weird minigames to unlock more minigames to unlock the final area where you faced off against Dracula. Skelltuns 2 was a gardening game where you grew plants (and non-plants)\u00a0by watering them, and blew up some things by watering them to find hidden tomes that would reveal that Skelltuns 3 was in the works too.</p>\n<p>So, what about Skelltuns 3...?</p>\n<p>As of writing this I'm actually not fully sure yet.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0won't be fixing this later. Surely you can tell, from my description of the first two games, that I want this to be a bit of a surprise, yes...?</p>\n<p>That being said, I will say, you can save at any time, so you can play it in shorter bursts! Or you can do the whole thing in one go, which will probably take about 10-15 minutes, maybe 20.</p>\n<p>P.S. At launch: Yeah, I know, the UI of certain parts\u00a0is a bit barebones currently. I wanna fill it in with jokes in an update possibly, but didn't think about the possibility until rather last-second, and wanted to prioritize making sure the game was relatively stable at launch. Sorry! Hopefully in an update!</p>\r\nSTORY:\r\n<p>Back in \"Skelltuns:\u00a0A Game That You Play\" (you don't really have to play that one before playing this one, since I'm on the subject, but you can if you want to!)...\u00a0Swordius Von Sue-Ord bested the dark Skelltun king, Dracula. Knowing Dracula would rise again one day, Swordius sealed themselves in a magic\u00a0vault, with a spell that would allow it to be opened on the day of Dracula's return.</p>\n<p>However...</p>\n<p>Swordius forgot to bring their sword with them into the vault. A thief stole the legendary sword that Swordius once wielded.</p>\n<p>And now, in the present time of today, when Skelltuns 3 is releasing...</p>\n<p>...you are playing as that thief.</p>\n<p>What will you do with this newfound power?</p>\n<p>Would you save the world?</p>\n<p>Would you doom it?</p>\n<p>Skelltuns cannot die. There is nothing anybody can do to stop you from doing anything you put your mind to.</p>\n<p>\"What is a Skelltun...?\", Deserkill wonders to themselves, holding the weapon in his hand. He decided to continue the thought:\u00a0\"It has been a mystery over the ages. Nobody knows how we started, or where we'll go. This weapon, too, has a mysterious past, and nobody is quite sure what its true power or purpose is...\"</p>\n<p>He laughs to himself, now speaking out loud, declaring,\u00a0\"I\u00a0will use this mysterious legacy for my own gains, and nobody else! You, player!\"</p>\n<p>You pause. Is he... addressing you?</p>\n<p>I guess that isn't out of line for this series tonally.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, help me out here! I know what I personally want to do, but don't have nearly as much experience with that sword as you!\"</p>\n<p>They pause for a moment to sigh, then continue:</p>\n<p>\"I know you will want something in return.\u00a0Your reward is the adventure, the excitement, and most importantly, the\u00a0<em>fun</em> you will have aiding me on this quest. I\u00a0will make sure it is worth your while simply from how entertaining it is! Oh, and since this is my last chance to talk, since the devs won't let me talk once the game's started:\u00a0He/they pronouns when talking about me, please!\"</p>\n<p>And so, you and the thief you are playing as, somehow both treated separately and simultaneously as one entity by this confusing and unimportant mess of a story that barely is important to anything that happens in the game itself, set out on your quest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T11:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bba7fc85a4cfff7500c1c53992a2961.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Happy Frog Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
