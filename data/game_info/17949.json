Frank enters the city by helicopter, the helicopter pilot is told to return to Frank in 72 hours. Frank quickly finds himself in a shopping center, where a crowd of people are trying to hide from the zombies - as it turns out, it was zombies that caused the closure of the city.</p>\n<p>Over the next 72 hours (this time is one of the strict conditions of the game), Frank must survive, save a few people and understand where the zombies came from. Along the way, he fights with zombies, seeks solutions, makes weapons and takes photographs - he is still a photojournalist. For successful shots, he gets more experience, which is appreciated in the game.</p>\n<h3>Wheelchair with machine guns</h3>\n<p>The second game &quot;forgets&quot; about Frank, it features a motorcyclist Chuck Green, who arrives in Willamet after all has settled down. There is a drug against turning into a zombie now, it is expensive, but effective. However, the new invasion of the zombie is still happening, Chuck drives around the town on a wheelchair with a pair of rifles, shooting hordes of zombies and simultaneously showing a touching concern for his daughter, who is somewhere nearby and needs a cure for zombification.</p>\n<h3>Zombies give a second chance</h3>\n<p>The third game &quot;resurrects&quot; Frank, who after success in the first game managed to fall to the bottom of life. In search of a new chance to succeed, Frank returns to Willameth, who seems to have been cleared of zombies twice, but Frank is very lucky - zombies capture the city for the third time. This time there are more enemies, among them many new ones. There are also more types of weapons - those that you need to do yourself from improvised means. Frank will visit places in the city that he did not suspect. Especially impressive will be a visit to the amusement park - &quot;Uranus Zone&quot;.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2011-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-11T08:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f55/f55ccd12602be8643a3510498f1e32ed.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/deadrising", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 89, "owned": 1320, "beaten": 77, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 71, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 304, "ratings_count": 159, "suggestions_count": 559, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 160, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Capcom U.S.A", "Capcom Vancouver"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
