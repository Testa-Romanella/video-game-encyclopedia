The goal is to survive as long as you can against the onslaught of missiles \u00a0to gain the most score you can.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The whole idea of this game is instead of shooting the weapon itself, you must use your control and skill over the ship to move the rockets towards the target. This takes away the whole requirement of shooting in the shooter genre and experience the ability to have a higher level control over what you shoot and when.</p>\n<p>The game gives you 5 seconds to get ready. Each circle surrounding the rockets will represent different amounts of control you have over that missile. If you want quick responsive\u00a0\u00a0movements, go closer to the missile. If you go out of the circles of the rocket, the rocket will no longer follow you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/727f2d02d8661e19e2c0c91434cd31fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sjjahaus"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
