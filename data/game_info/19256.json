However, there is a group of robots that are committed to resolving this crisis; studying human history deeply, they reach the conclusion that the answer to their problems is the soul.To learn any more about how they can achieve this, they must speak to the creator of this world.

To this end, they endeavour to build a trans-dimensional space transporter.GameAbyss Raiders: Uncharted is an action tower defence game, set in a future where robots are the dominant species in the universe.
