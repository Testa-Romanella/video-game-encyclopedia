Our story is not a tale of galactic conquest, with romantics believing in a brighter future and ready to give up everything for an adventure. Our story is about the last hope, about one of the many colonizers who left their home planet after a global ecological disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpace turned out to be treacherous and dangerous, a minimal miscalculation in coordinates became fatal for our pioneers. Supplies were depleted, energy was running out, and inhabited worlds were never reached. A desperate attempt to save the crew forced the artificial intelligence to take extreme measures\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInstead of pleasant fresh air filling the lungs, the titanium-type atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen. Instead of luxurious flora covering the entire globe, a lifeless desert. Fortunately there were rare deposits of carbon dioxide, salts, but most importantly water! The planet is not suitable for life... Yet... But terraformable. Can artificial intelligence solve this problem? Let's not go that far, it will require huge reserves of energy, and it is not so easy to accumulate, one problem at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's an exciting and challenging adventure as the AI. You will have to stabilize the situation, accumulate resources and start terraforming the planet to wake humans from hibernation. You will encounter puzzles, events, and unforeseen circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLong and detailed production chains resembling actual processes will keep you in tension and push you to constantly improve the architecture.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe multitude of resources and processing methods will give you a wide range of options in progression across the board. Allowing you to shape your own optimal game approach.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStock up on energy and build the last stronghold of humanity! Conquer the planet and give the wanderers hope for life, save them!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nJust don't ruin this planet, too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T02:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/8664f6f45f3a4d9c1d310d7f3d8fb551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergey Jakovlev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TAC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
