If there is any colored tile in between the two you are attempting to remove, it must be removed first. 100 Challenging levels and 4 different game modes, Casual, Pressure, Change Up and Frantic mode,  await you delivering 400 levels of frustratingly enjoyable gameplay! <br/><br/>Casual Mode: <br/>Earn stars for completing levels with a fast finger. Points are calculated according to speed.<br/><br/>Pressure Mode:<br/>5 Seconds. The heat is on! The timer counts down from 5 until a pair of colored tiles are cleared.

Beware\u2026 your eyes may begin to betray you when they start drifting towards checking the remaining digits on the timer becoming a distraction from diffusing the ticking time bomb! Only a quick wit and strong situational awareness can save you!<br/><br/>Change Up Mode:<br/>Earn stars for completing levels with a fast finger. Points are calculated according to speed, but this time, with a twist! The color of the tiles will change at random intervals increasing difficulty.

You will have a countdown match timer and the color of the tiles will change at random intervals. Of course, we\u2019ve added a couple extra seconds to the clock\u2026 but that won\u2019t help you! Mwahaha!<br/><br/>Earn your way to 400 gold stars by solving the maze of eye-straining colors as the sweat beads down your forehead. Grit your teeth, squint your eyes and prepare yourself. <br/><br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>* 100 Levels &amp; 4 Game Modes (400 Levels of total game play)<br/>* Casual, Pressure, Change Up and Frantic game modes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:46:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7a3213eca9465b6c8a96df1fc6cf089_kdIBks4.jpg", "website": "http://www.KillerBytesGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["KillerBytes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Brandon Velazquez"], "esrb_rating": null}
