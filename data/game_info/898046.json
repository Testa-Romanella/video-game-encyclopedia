You're probably thinking \"wow, this game looks/was absolutely horrendous. Why is this trashware on itch.io?\" Well let me explain.</p>\n<p>This game was not designed as a personal project for the sole intent of other people playing it. The team of 5 that worked on this game made this game for an assignment as part of our studies for a game development course at University. We made this game within the span of 13 weeks, and a lot of factors caused this game to turn out the way it did in terms of quality. Essentially, this was the group's first ever time making a fully-fledged game, and how much we have let to learn is very clear in this project. The reason why this game is on itch.io alongside all the other great games that amazing developers have made is because it was a requirement as part of our assignment to upload it here specifically.<br/></p>\n<p>But by all means, if you have played this game and think it is utter trash and would like to tell us why, please feel free to write a comment on this page as to why that is and what you think could be better. By doing this, not only will you let us know about where we could improve with our next projects, but you will also assist us in our reflective practices in our course, as this is the kind of feedback we need to reflect on.</p>\n<p>Aside from all that, thanks for checking out our game, and we hope to be able to make better-quality projects in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>- Mitchel Smith, Co-developer</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:53:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3a/f3a9a40a70e16be2bb53cdacf17c6616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LYCORIS", "Dolores", "Mitchel Smith", "DalekBoy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
