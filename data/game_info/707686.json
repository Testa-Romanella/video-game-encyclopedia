The first wrote a letter asking for a game with lots of deaths, guns and destruction. The second asked for a game that had Mariah Carey becoming the queen of hell.</p>\n<p>Thus we created an experience where Mariah Carey goes to the mall and is swarmed by an angry mod. You will need to fight them off in order to reach the stage. After killing enough enemies Mariah powers up to become QUEEN OF HELL MARIAH.</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to target and hit enemies with different objects.
