It was made in a custom engine,\u00a0 using an old version of OpenGL, so I don't have a clue how compatible it is with latest OSX / Linux / Windows.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d13/d13d82a21052f19a125bda3a1d23f5e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lunar Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
