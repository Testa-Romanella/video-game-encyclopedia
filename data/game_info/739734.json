May the best cryptocurrency win!<h3>History</h3>After the 2008 crisis, an anonymous Internet user who identifies himself as Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as a new currency, a new decentralized digital asset designed to function as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography and the blockchain to control its creation and management that does not depend on the control of governments or central banks, to help people break free from the monetary madness of the Fed.<br/><br/>Bitcoin was born as a decentralized currency, with peer-to-peer transactions to operate throughout the world. A safe currency and, to the horror of the bankers, unconfiscable by the state. On the Internet they begin to make fun of this new currency, disparagingly calling it, \"\"cryptocurrency\"\", but many begin to see its potential and in 2010 the first known exchange takes place: Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, which at the time was equivalent at $ 30. That is, each Bitcoin was equal to $ 0.003.<br/><br/>Many people start betting on Bitcoin and this scares the various manipulative forces in the world. Different cryptocurrencies are beginning to be created that want to take advantage of the prestige of Bitcoin to steal people's money and, incidentally, discredit Bitcoin.<br/><br/>In 2014, when Bitcoin was already being exchanged for $ 1,000, a force from the dark side of the world tried to pervert Bitcoin by creating a new currency called Etherium. Although it is also based on cryptography and blockchain, many dark forces control this currency, it is no longer 100% decentralized and strange things come up like NFTs. And the first fight between cryptocurrencies begins.<br/><br/>But the great manipulators of the money market, the bankers very friendly to the FED, could not let people go free again thanks to Bitcoin and conspired to create a new type of cryptocurrency, linked to the value of the dollar. And so Tether arises, a stable-coin whose value is linked to the dollar. It is the closest cryptocurrency to fiat money, to the dollar that has lost 90% of its value in the last 50 years, with which they want to confuse and deceive people of good will.<br/><br/>As the subject of cryptography and blockchain is computer science, the world's large technology companies unite to try to stop Bitcoin with a new manipulative alternative and in 2019, Libra, the cryptocurrency of the technological ones. Although formally it is one of the great technologies that assumes the leadership of the currency, surely you have some of its apps on your smartphone, all the technologies are involved. Anything goes in this war to undermine trust in Bitcoin.<br/><br/>But in a world where fiat money rules and unicorn companies flourish, social media memes have great power in the world. And a great of the world, with dreams of traveling to other worlds, takes advantage of his knowledge of this meme world to have fun promoting an old cryptocurrency that had been launched in memes: Dogecoin. And with the power of the meme, he sets out to try to conquer the world and become a millionaire through this cryptocurrency.<br/><br/>And so there are many other cryptocurrencies that enter into a fight every year and several dozen cryptocurrencies are launched that try to obtain the savings of the good people who can still save. Thus, the world is now invaded by many currencies, by many cryptocurrencies that fight fiercely to survive, that try to destroy Bitcoin and take advantage of the good of humanity.<br/><br/>Coins Invaders was born in this format, a tribute to the great Japanese designer Toshihiro Nishikado and his famous video game Space Invaders from 1978, to reflect the unequal fight that Bitcoin has with other cryptocurrencies that arise from dark forces in the world to pervert good people and keep them prisoners on his communist Orwellian fiat money farm.<br/><br/>Drive the ship that will be in charge of taking bitcoin to its great victory, don't let the altcoins get in the way, they will try everything possible to defeat you and destroy the ship.
