With up to 15 slots in your gun and up to 5 rarities to each Component the combinations are near limitless. <br/>For every wave you clear you gain valuable knowledge both in how to build your gun and actual science points\u2014 spent to unlock new and interesting modifiers + projectiles. With more at your disposal you can reach further and further into the incoming waves of enemies. <br/>And if you are skilled enough, you might beat Grand Daddy Crab...<br/><br/><strong>If This Weapon Doesn\u2019t pan out? </strong><br/><br/>There is always next run. With slight rogue-lite elements you can achieve new heights of gameplay with unlockable modifiers and projectiles.  Your research is a priority, after all they don't call you Dr. Professor Scientist for nothing. <br/><br/><strong>Will I have to play thousands of hours to enjoy it? </strong><br/><br/>Crazy combinations are available right from the beginning, the longer you play the crazier you get.
