It was created as a project for my Capstone class--the last major project-based class required for my Associates of Animation degree.</p>\n<p>The environment was inspired by the aesthetics of Studio Ghibli productions, Breath of the Wild, The Dragon Prince, The Illustrated Nature, and other media. The game features a single player character that comes with her own custom animations--walking, running, jumping, etc. Keyboard/mouse and Xbox controllers are both supported.</p>\n<p>WASD (Left Analog) to move.<br/>\r\nMouse (Right Analog) to rotate camera.<br/>\r\nLeft Shift (Right Bumper) to sprint.<br/>\r\nSpace (A) to jump.<br/>\r\nF (X) to toggle sitting. Take a load off, enjoy the ambience!</p>\n<p>All mesh assets were created using Blender. Textures were created in Blender and Photoshop.</p>\n<p>Quick note: The Options menu does not work. It was a placeholder that I planned on finishing if I had the opportunity, but I ran out of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music<br/>Joshua Key</p>\n<p>Sound Design<br/>Dragos Matkovski<br/>Little Robot Sound Factory<br/>Brandt Cooley</p>\n<p>Fonts<br/>Brittany Murphy Designs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T08:32:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ef/2ef47691052503756e25733ca89ce968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Souzou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
