You will need to break through in order to return this valuable technology to Earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls (redefinable):</strong><br/>Cursor keys: Move<br/>Z: Fire<br/>X: Engage hyperdrive<br/>Shift: Focus<br/>Ctrl-Alt-Enter: Fullscreen (for the non-web version) Note that you might find fullscreening works better if you edit the 'config.txt' file and add the line fullscreen_windowed = 1 to it.<br/><br/>Successful use of your remaining hyperdrive fuel is key to your success. While you cannot engage in a hyperspace jump, you can temporarily shift into inverse space, allowing you to temporarily avoid destruction. However, you can only engage it for a total of ten seconds before you run out of fuel.</p>\n<p>The energy requirements to keep the hyperdrive fuel stable on such a small ship means that most of your weapons systems are locked down while the fuel is present. Conversely, the more hyperdrive fuel you use up, the more powerful your ship's arsenal will become.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>Maxim generously drew most of the enemy ships and created the PC speaker sound effects.
