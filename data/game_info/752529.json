SFX were also hastily produced.</p>\n<p>Made for the 7DRL 2022, this game is my first roguelike and first libtcod game. I want to thank Hideo Kojima and\u00a0the creators of the libtcod python tutorial and of course every member of the roguelikedev community.</p>\n<p>This is a niche game, but I believe even people who don't know death stranding will enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-- Press N to start a new game, C to continue or ESC to quit</p>\n<ul><li>Move around with QWE ASD ZXC or with the numpad</li><li>You can rest with S or numpad 5</li><li>Open inventory with I</li><li>Get item off the floor with G</li><li>Look around with L or the Mouse</li><li>Scan your surroundings with O</li></ul>\n<p>Change screen resolution, volume and fullscreen toggle with ESC while ingame.</p>\n<p>Tips on how to play:</p>\n<p>You're always MOVING UP the map to progress to the next zone!</p>\n<ol><li>Lost cargo will give you extra items if delivered on the next outpost.</li><li>Watch out for your stamina, if you have time rest to regenerate it.
