I tried to take his idea of having intentional bugs and go one step further in the sense that once a player uses a bug to progress, the game \"fixes\" said bug.</p>\n<p>This is my first completed project, so it won't be perfect. Some of the mechanics might be a little janky and not everything might be as clear as I thought. So sorry in advance. Any feedback is welcome and is much appreciated, as I\u00a0hope to improve for future projects</p>\n<p>Big thanks to everyone who helped test this game and provided feedback.\u00a0</p><p>SOLUTION VIDEO:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:42:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2e/c2efde66a253e8d554afec77a2ca3e56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustinGalante1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
