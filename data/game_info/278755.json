For the lone knight in the cells of the castle, it's plainly a curse.</em></p>\n<p>Spend your seconds wisely in this frozen shard of time as you battle through the corridors of a ruined castle in this pseudo-roguelike game, Endless Vigil! Featuring several challenging enemies, a unique time system, and a boss straight from the nightmares of your past.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in four days\u00a0for the Extra Credits Holiday Jam 2018, with the theme 'Present'</p>\n<p>Tips and Instructions: This game is meant to be completed after several 'loops' (running the counter at the top out and returning back to the start). Each loop, your stats reset, but your masteries and titles do\u00a0<em>not.\u00a0</em>Masteries increase your exp gain through loops, and titles raise your base stats when you start loops. If you want to start a new loop early, you can press R at any time. If you die, you lose all of your progress.</p><p>Created By:</p>\n<p>Art - Scott 'SJpixels' @PixelsSj</p>\n<p>Design - Jon 'Sishio'</p>\n<p>Programming - Zach 'Cornucanis'</p>\n<p>Audio - Alex 'Alexzen'\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/489/489f104e509eba55cdfd097d84530539.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Anemoi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
