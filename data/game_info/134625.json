My IGMC 2017 submission. Also my first project to be uploaded on here; I'll come back with updated versions if there are any problems, and upload more projects in the future. Currently aware of a bug where followers don't always disappear when they're supposed to, as you can see in the uploaded screenshot. (v1.3 - the MV deployment tool excluded several necessary animations from the initial build, these have been manually re-added.)<br/></p>\n<p>I thought it turned out pretty well for a 5 day project, but it definitely could have been more polished had I\u00a0seen the contest much earlier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87a/87afe11b1bdf1b15c384f5e9c4d899bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRealDMac"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
