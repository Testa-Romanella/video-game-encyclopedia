Just zombies, gore, and a hell of a lot of shooting.</p>\r\nFEATURES\r\n<p>Undead is a never-ending, action-packed shooter where you kill the hordes of zombies and survive for as long as you can. Once you smash the start button, your world begins to randomly generate - as soon as its finished, you begin with a small pistol at your side, and a trusty knife in your back pocket to kill the endless waves of zombies; sure its enough for now, but what about when you need more firepower, what will you do? The answer is very simple. Get more and more kills and unlock supply drops for powerups, the odd cosmetic here and there, and new weapons which pack far more heat. You're health regenerates over time but make sure that you reserve your health as more and more brain-hungry zombies come to feast on your brain.\u00a0How long will you survive in an Undead world?</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p><strong>MOUSE</strong>\u00a0- interaction in menu/move view<br/><strong>MOUSE WHEEL</strong>\u00a0- swap weapon<br/><strong>LMB</strong>\u00a0- select/shoot<br/><strong>RMB</strong>\u00a0- jump/remove hat<br/><strong>MMB</strong>\u00a0- throw grenade<br/><strong>A</strong>\u00a0- move left<br/><strong>D</strong>\u00a0- move right<br/><strong>R</strong>\u00a0- reload<br/><strong>TAB (hold)</strong>\u00a0- show scoreboard<br/><strong>SPACE (hold)</strong>\u00a0- restart<br/><strong>ESC</strong>\u00a0- pause</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Art by\u00a0Badly Drawn Cube<br/>Music by\u00a0Zach Gibson<br/>Sounds provided by\u00a0www.freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/20418e33f39a8d98dad8ebbfdb693926.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Yeti Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
