It looked partly human and partly ghost as it floated above the pavement. The child felt it\u2019s restlessness and approached it.<br/></p>\n<p>Then, a golden light emerged from his chest and captured the attention of the creature. Its restlessness and anxiety was gone as it looked into the bright circle floating in front of its eyes. It was a wondering spirit, a person who had recently passed away and needed guidance into the spirit realm.</p>\n<p>And so they went on their way together, the child enlighting the path of their travel. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TUTORIAL INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to guide the butterfly through the level by using different lights to attract it .\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The main character can absorb up to 6 lights and move them to different light sources. Lights cannot change source directly, so you have to collect them first.</p>\n<p>Use the lights to solve puzzles and to battle dark matter. If they catch the butterfly, you\u2019ll have to start over from the last checkpoint.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve reached the orange wall of light, you\u2019ve concluded the current gameplay available for this prototype.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>This game can be played with a PS3/PS4/Xbox\u00a0controller or keyboard and\u00a0mouse.</p>\n<p>Left Joystick | WASD</p><p>Walking</p><p>Right Joystick | Mouse</p><p>Moving camera</p><p>Hold L1 (+ Move Right Joystick) | LMB (Left Mouse Button)</p><p>Placing light\u00a0 (+ Aim)</p><p>Hold R1 (+ Move Right Joystick) | RMB (Right Mouse Button)</p>Absorbing light (+ Aim )\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>\n<p>This game concept was made in a 3 day game jam session by a team of 4 people, based in the Netherlands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is meant as an experiment to find out what the possibilities are when you play with light and when you are able to move those lights to different sources.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not by any means a finished product.
