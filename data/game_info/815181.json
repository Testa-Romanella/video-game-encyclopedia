In the Tower there are different mazes and also monsters you have to fight with your friends on your side.<br/><br/>In every maze there are also hidden easter eggs that you can find to unlock Achievements so explore everything and dont rush through mazes without checking everything out!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>Mazes<br/></li><li>Story<br/></li><li>RPG<br/></li><li>Milk</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T04:08:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd296548a08b28922922782d2132f70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raphael"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raphael"], "esrb_rating": null}
