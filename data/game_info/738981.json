The main goal of the game is jumping further and further, collecting coins, beating records and just funny time spending. You can buy beautiful skins in the shop, compete with friends for higher scoreboard position, or just make long waiting a bit\u00a0shorter.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is first game that I made, so there a lot of mistakes. However, I hope you enjoy\u00a0the game. Yes, it isn`t perfect, but I and my friend really have fun along couple of days playing this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:34:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/392/39288c6336b9c84f421672f0340b2b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HummeL"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
