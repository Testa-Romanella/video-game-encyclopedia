The music was done in some 8-Bit keyboard app for Android in one go, so its just there to be there. But the assets are all made by me, and i quite like them (even if they are nowhere near finished). All in all it took around maby 8 - 9 hours i would guess.. but damn it would be so much more fun with music and smarter spawn timing.<br/></p>\n<p>Im probably gonna add some more features, like for example double jump, attacks or more and post it as like a after-Jam Version</p>\n<p>If you would like i could also sell or upload the Assets, but im have not decided yet.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun while playing,</p>\n<p>Felix :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9daf9a10f72be4b9299a4eacba75e2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Flucx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
