{"id": 978138, "slug": "behold-battle", "name": "Behold Battle", "name_original": "Behold Battle", "description": "Guess which army will win, and watch them fight for your amusement. Behold Battle is a simple auto battler, where you see heroes and monsters fight to the death in randomly generated battles.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>- A normal game mode that has 20 rounds with increasing army complexity. Guess correctly to continue, or game over if you are wrong too many times.<br/><br/>- A simulator where you create both armies and watch them battle.<br/><br/>- 72 different units, some with unique attacks such as spawning undead minions.<br/><br/>- From small to gigantic battles, and many difficulties to test your prediction powers.<br/><br/>- Gold betting mode, and a spell mode where each side gets a random spell.<br/><br/>- Complete challenges to earn more spectators.<br/><br/><strong>Please note:</strong> Behold Battle uses the same art as Mage and Monsters, but has a very different core gameplay loop. It is a much more simple and casual game, where you judge how strong one army will be against another. Or just play around in the sandbox mode. A lot of time and care have gone into creating many different variations of this simple idea of guessing who will win. I have strived to make Behold Battle as polished as I can, so hopefully for many it is an intuitive, unique and enjoyable game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-11T08:47:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c47461886201ddcacf7a735e9143cad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lasse Zacho Malver"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Lasse Zacho Malver"], "esrb_rating": null}
