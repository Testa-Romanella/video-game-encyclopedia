You can turn soldiers into zombies and then control them. You control zombies by clicking on the ground with the right mouse button or by clicking on a soldier on the right with your mouse. When you do, the zombies will attack the soldiers or run to the point. If zombies are closer to a soldier than you are, the soldiers will attack the zombie.</p>\n<p>There are 2 types of items. First the cat food, which heals and cat food, which increases the score.<br/></p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Bugs and Errors :</p>\n<p>This is not a finished game and will probably not get any further updates. As mentioned above, it was developed during a Game Jame. That said, there are a few bugs where we didn't have enough time to fix them. However, since we now want to focus on new projects, the bugs will probably not be fixed. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's a list of bigs we've found, if you find any, just write it down in the comments.</p>\n<ul><li>Shooting doesn't really work on some PCs and we don't know why because it is different from PC to PC</li><li>A can of cat food goes crazy through the level and we just couldn't fix it</li></ul>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Who worked on it:</p>\n<ul><li>programmer\u00a0| Paul Neuhold</li><li>3D artist / level  designer | Maximilian Silwester</li><li>2D artist\u00a0| Junying Huang</li><li>second programmer / second 3D Artist\u00a0| Valentin Breunig</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d97/d9734a5adfd404bc8bfab83a278a8293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leek Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
