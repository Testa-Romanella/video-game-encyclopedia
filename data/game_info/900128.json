I'm cryodensity, and this is my first ever game that I developed.</p>\n<p>I built and developed Dungeon Wizard for the One-button game jam, as well as using it as a base to start building my knowledge and skills with unity and game development overall.</p>\n<p>Dungeon Wizard is a point and click platformer, using only one button (<strong>Left mouse button</strong>) to attack and destroy surrounding mobs and objects!</p>\n<p>Work your way through the designed levels and have fun! It's a little short, as I said I'm just trying to build my knowledge on game dev and have some fun :') Feedback is encouraged!</p>\n<p>Game Assets credit! : 0x72\u00a0(Robert) :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T18:42:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d30cbc83ff28dd41cf18230dc6593eae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cryodensity"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
