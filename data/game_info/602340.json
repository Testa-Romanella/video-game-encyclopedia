{"id": 602340, "slug": "roll-3", "name": "Roll", "name_original": "Roll", "description": "<strong> Roll is a relaxing deckbuilder with dice. In each play through, you will have 2500 rolls to craft the perfect set of dice and collect as many points as possible.</strong><br/> <br/><br/><br/>   Roll is designed first and foremost as a relaxing and meditative experience. Get lost in the satisfying sounds and effects as all your worries melt away. From the minimalistic UI to the slow peaceful music, everything was designed to create the perfect zen environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>   While the \"Clicker\" genre is not known for its variety or depth of game mechanics, Roll offers a unique dicebuilding system which allows you to explore different strategies and synergies between upgrades. Each run will present you with new and interesting decisions to keep you coming back for more.<h3>A Note From the Developer:</h3>If you\u2019re thinking about buying Roll please keep in mind that while I am super passionate about this game, I am a solo developer. This is not a triple A experience with hundreds of hours of content. Instead, I offer a small, satisfying experience inspired by roguelike mechanics to add a sneaky depth of strategy. Get it for less than a slice of avocado toast or a grande caramel macchiato supreme from your local coffee empire. <br/><br/><br/>Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have feedback, questions, or problems with the game. I\u2019ll do my best to get back to you as quickly as possible and provide support if needed. Also let me know if you enjoyed the game, because that makes my day and motivates my future projects!<h3>What You Get</h3><ul><li>Relaxing and Deeply Satisfying Gameplay<br/></li><li>Procedurally Generated Content for Extra Replayability<br/></li><li>An Excuse to Repeatedly Tap Your Spacebar.
