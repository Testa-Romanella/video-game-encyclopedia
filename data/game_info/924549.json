Look for clues and mysterious oddities on the radio waves and at different locations around town to help them prove their dog's disappearance is not your everyday run-away dog. Click the map to move Katie from place to place. Then click and hold the mouse button down on the radio dial to change radio frequencies. Note: if you\u2019re having problems moving the dial counterclockwise, click and hold in the center of the dial and move the mouse to the outside of the dial and make large counterclockwise circles around the dial. You can be within 2.0 of the correct frequency when each event's time triggers and it will register. If you want to resize the screen, set your screen size to where you want it then refresh the window.
