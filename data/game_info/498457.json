It will defend you from enemies by shooting the ones close to it. The ammo you will find will randomly appear around your machine gun and will be brown on the minimap in the top-right corner of your screen. you will need to find strategies to move around enemies to get to the ammo and back. to pick up the ammo, touch it, and to put ammo into the machine gun, touch the machine gun. the amount of ammo you are carrying will be shown above your player, and the amount of ammo the machine gun has will be a big number above it as well.</p>\n<p>pro tips:</p>\n<ul><li>use mimap.</li><li>once you leave the machine gun, collect as much ammo as possible before returning. there is no limit to how much you can carry or put in the gun.</li><li>if there is a small hole between enemies, take it! you will fail a couple of times, but you will get better.</li><li>spin around the enemies whenever you get the chance so they pile up instead of surrounding you.</li><li>dont hang out beside the machine gun often. every second counts. Non-stop action! this song should get you in the mood to do just that:\u00a0March!</li><li>try your own strategies! if you follow one or two of these rules, you might as well follow all of them. but you can also try your own completely different techniques. (I'm actually really bad at this game to be honest but these rules are what I observe real pros doing).</li><li>use headphones. wont really do anything but im new to making music and want to know what you think.</li></ul>\n<p>if you can, i would really appreciate it if you made a tutorial video and put it on YouTube, or atleast a video of you playing it. i would put it in this description for everyone to see.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T03:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc4e24b99aeeace0fafa72db5f2a92ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["samuel0l0y"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
