This will be my first real entrence in a normal gamejam since I started with Unity earler this year. My main goal is to complete this game so I can add it  to my portfolio. I find Gamejams a great opportunity to both learn a lot about game creation as well as having a ton of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Few Days In</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Progress has been a bit slow.\u00a0 I spent one and a half day just trying to make my dungeon random generator work with alot of failures. Ended up satisfying with something that at least isnt horrible. Also added sounds and some Fonts. Have been able to make some simple enemies but with no AI. Also created a Menu with Settings page and Credits page. Only game mode now is Ordinary game which isnt much of a game at the moment. Just some generated dungeon and random mobs walking into the wall.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Last Few Days</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The process is taking alot of energy and I'm starting to be a bit afraid that I won't be able to complete the game in time. However I would like to at least make something decent enough to submit.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This Jam has been an eyeopener for me. I have come far in the process of making games, but I still feel that I ended up far from where I hoped to be with this game. I imagined that I would be able to complete\u00a0a fast paced action dungeon crawler with multiple weapons, enemies and effects, along with a massive boss in the end of it all in all its glory. However, fighting against Unity, which I do not yet know that well but also with  my own code. Solving errors and figuring out\u00a0bugs took me forever and it lost me alot of valuable time. One day were lost making a randomized dungeon generator from scratch which ended up being only semi usable. <br/></p>\n<p>I guess I will try to make some kind of gameplay from what I've got. But It won't become a great game in the last few hours before the submission deadline. However, hopefully I can keep working on it afterwards, refining it into more of a game. For the next jam I'm entering I will take with me that I will need to make a better schedule. I really need to get better at knowing when to make what during the \u00a0jam so I end up actually finishing it with most of the essentials implemented. I do se the benefit of having a team during a Jam. Sorry this text is a bit messy, writing it with some sleep deprevation. I might come back to modify it tomorrow.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T13:45:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d17/d178720a79b4100852945f59c8b0eb39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wolfheat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
