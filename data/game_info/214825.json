Inspired by <em>Quake</em> and <em>Getting over it with Bennett Foddy.</em></p>\n<p>In this game, in order to advance, you have to use Quake-like rocket jumps. The physics are your enemy! Your player bounces for a while when landing, and this makes the game very difficult.</p>\n<p>You can also collect optional coins, which do nothing. They're here just for your satisfaction.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>X - Choose/Fire</li><li>Arrow keys - Select/Aim</li><li>R - Restart level</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21a5f88ef262dbbddd3b972ff42c5b1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iLiquid"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
