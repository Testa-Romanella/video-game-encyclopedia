And rhythm games rock. In fact, we like them both so much we decided to make them into one. The result? The Most Addicting Sheep Game. It\u2019s an engagingly simple rhythm platformer where jumps and rolls must be perfectly timed to the music to complete the increasingly complex levels with maximum score. Oh, and it has a cute sheep.<br/><br/>We loved making TMASG. We love playing TMASG. And we\u2019d love to know if you do too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T11:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d18/d18f7e45d12775bbc9bdf8bcc79b59d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Just So"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["JG Southey"], "esrb_rating": null}
