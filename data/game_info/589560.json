I'm sorry if it's broken or laggy on because I didn't have time to optimize it properly. For best experience download the executable version of the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, you're the meme delivery expert, you deliver memes to people physically\u00a0because they have no internet or something. The only catch is that you have to find the recipient's house yourself, because you don't have a gps.</p><p>After you've started a job, by interacting once with Meme OS,\u00a0follow the instructions shown at the top middle of the screen.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Player: WASD - move, E - interact</p>\n<p>Car: WASD - drive, Spacebar - brake (combine with S to brake more), E - exit car</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas are welcome, leave them in the comments. I'll implement them, if I decide to keep working on this game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:46:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f3/4f314b5de5cebaca28ad31960d5ce275.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["hero snowman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
