The game was a finalist for the Innovation Award at the 2009 Independent Games Festival and received a considerable amount of &quot;Internet buzz&quot; for its humorous gameplay at the time of its release. You Have to Burn the Rope is a brief parody of excessive hand-holding in AAA video games, in which destroying the titular rope is the only way to win and the player is told that fact in advance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-15T22:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcb/bcb74f87339a189c00ee5274dabf69e8.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/432872", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
