The goal of the experience is to find a way to avoid your seemingly inescapable fate of freezing to death on a barren planet\u00a0after thirty two minutes.<br/></p>\n<p>The catch? You only get one shot to do it.</p>\n<p>Every second you spend playing is a second that ticks permanently away from your total experience, a fact that you have little to no control over. Choose how you spend your time wisely, the planet is not forgiving.</p>\n<p>While the situation may be bleak, you aren't completely without tools. Stranded along side you are drones that you possess total control over. Change their color,\u00a0 send them out to scout, or just scoot them around. This small army is yours to control, and how you use them may very well determine your outcome.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This experience is free to download, and was designed on the Oculus Rift S. It was made using Unity's XR development kit, and such should work with any XR compatible headset.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T15:12:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/98550ab7a23524bf650f26ea6e93966c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr_Bluejay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
