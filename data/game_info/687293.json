Sometimes I cut even pretty\u00a0important features, like an ingame tutorial. You can read more about my experience during this month in my post mortem, that I will upload later today.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for checking this out and taking your time to read this! &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>It is reccomended to play this demo with a controller.</p>\n<p>(XBOX Layout):</p>\n<p>Left Stick / WASD - Move Player</p>\n<p>Right Stick / Mouse - Move Camera</p>\n<p>A / Space - Jump</p>\n<p>RB / Shift - Dash</p>\n<p>You can double jump in this game.</p>\n<p>To perform a wall run dash into a wall und hold RB.
