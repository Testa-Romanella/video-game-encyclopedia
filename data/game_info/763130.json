You have to slide maki by table in four directions to combine them into neat sets, so you free up space for new workpieces. Soy sauce will help if you're not coping fast enough.<br/><br/>There is no need to hurry, but you need to think ahead, keep track of which figure will be next and rely on the probabilities of where it will appear. <br/>Each level, until you reach the final ones, the table will expand, but also the variety of elements too. Watch the countdown to soy sauce, it can greatly change the situation on the table.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T04:29:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940817fe5f44af8fadbb96ed7e3bbf85.jpg", "website": "http://makiomino.fun", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Roman Chumak"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Roman Chumak"], "esrb_rating": null}
