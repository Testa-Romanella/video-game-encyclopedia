I made it for a school project for about half a year when I was 16. There were many things I learned over the period of this project, with everything from collision code to the importance of cutting features. I made it in Java and Slick2d.</p><p>In terms of gameplay, the game is a puzzle platformer. The character must collect orbs in order to traverse the level, with the color of the orb dictating what the player can touch. This leads to a mazelike environment in which the player must figure out what paths lead to dead ends and which paths lead to the exit.</p><p>Instructions:</p><ul><li>Spacebar to jump</li><li>A and D to move left and right</li><li>Pick up color gems to turn the color of the gem. This will allow you to  be stopped by walls of that color, and let you walk through walls of other colors.</li><li>R to restart</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d0/4d01a4ff261b48fd3b1f5195fd9bf8e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Impmaster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
