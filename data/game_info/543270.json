{"id": 543270, "slug": "orphanarium", "name": "Orphanarium", "name_original": "Orphanarium", "description": "<p>In this cute and dark game, Chibi Ucogi goes against both real and imaginary threats to save her friends from the ultimate evil! She must disobey authority to do that, which creates an internal conflict that may drive her mad. She sees weird things after acquiring certain holy or unholy items, due to strict indoctrination, mental abuse and even fear. And things might get violent the closer she gets to the bad endings!<br/></p>\n<p>In Orphanarium you have to avoid enemies and find items that will allow you to progress further in the story. It is a short game (about 20 minutes to finish if you know what to do) but you could play several times to view all the animated cut-scenes, secrets, multiple endings and reach the final boss.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Never try to change the window size of the game because it breaks. The game contains religious elements. Chibi Ucogi is also a fighting character in the upcoming adult game MoGi Origins.<br/></p>\n<p>It would be a huge help if you buy this small game, or even if you leave a positive or constructive comment! Thank you in advance for your support!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bf/5bfd7b6868b1615674309a39d0d72927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Veins"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
