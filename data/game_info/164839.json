A lot of stress during this time, but I __was__ able to learn a couple of new things! For this project, mainly the new tools I'm using~ I do have other skills I would like to test, but let's just wait for the next jam \ud83d\ude0b</p>\n<p>Well, more about the __game__ now, very simple one, but I tested a lot of my new skills in it, so I'm actually satisfied with the end result (of course it can always be better though). After a long time jamming again, and not being able to just stay 2 days straight working, and using new software, I had a rough start, but everything ended well \ud83d\ude04 So it was actually good for me to do forget about compo and do it in a slower pace in jam.</p>\n<p>No BGM and no fancy art, but I think this game didn't ask for it, and I was able to make (mostly) everything by myself~ so it actually follows compo rules, except the time constraint!</p>\n<p>Anyway, that's it for me, I hope you enjoyed this small time playing my game, and as always, any feedback is much appreciated! \ud83d\ude4c<br/><strong>/**************************************************/</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/573/5736011d03847327e25b01c4e0de59be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nihil Aleph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
