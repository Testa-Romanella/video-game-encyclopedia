Self-reliant. Denies affection, but becomes expressively passionate toward her lover.<br/><br/><strong>Sophia Archer</strong><br/><br/>Sophia is the Submissive type of character, she has a service-oriented mindset and finds peace in taking instructions from those she looks up to. This can be at home, at workplace, with friends or in community relationships.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>From Class 2-3!</strong><br/>In this class you\u2019ll have Blair, Viviana and Etna as your classmates!<br/><br/><strong>Blair Walker</strong><br/><br/>Blair is a Trap, he\u2019s a guy that was always a bit more on the feminine side but is self-aware of that, he enjoys hiding his identity. Loves to tease people and play around with them. Overall he\u2019s caring and hyperactive. Loves sweets. A lot. Really A LOT.<br/><br/><strong>Viviana Rodriguez</strong><br/><br/>Viviana is a quiet person, very soft-spoken and emotionally reserved, with a dry sense of humor. All of this has a reason and its because of Viviana\u2019s griming past, filled with sadness and despair. Maybe you can help her get her out of her shell?<br/><strong><br/>Etna Edgeworth</strong><br/><br/>Etna is a Sensitive yet smart person. She\u2019s a romantic who knows everything there is to know about romance from books. She's eager to have the real experience, and to feel what she feels when reading the passages derived from someone else's experience. Very literate and quick to pick up new knowledge, especially knowledge that supplements her understanding of the erotic. Becomes more self-deprecating the deeper in love she falls, as if she feels unworthy of the love she wants. Discussions about love and romance are more deeply personal for her and can win her heart.<br/><br/><strong>From Class 3-3!</strong><br/>In this class you\u2019ll have Raven and Rika as your classmates!<br/><br/><strong>Raven Blackwell</strong><br/><br/>Raven is apathetic, usually negative. She shows off her indifferent manner openly to everyone. But once she gets intimated, she starts talking with insulting manner which is to conceal her actual sentiment. Also is aggressive in the beginning but with time you can get to see her girly side and sweet side, might not be much but its what she has to offer.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Rika Ushiro</strong><br/><br/>Rika is of Japanese Rich Background and you can see she was raised as such, she is worldly wise, with an unflappable pleasant grace. She is also the student council president of the school so it isn\u2019t someone you\u2019d like to get on the wrong side with. Although she is from a Elite background she is not arrogant, in fact she is quite humble.<br/><br/></p><p>If you want to help the project and even get something IN the game consider pledging on Patreon!<br/><br/>https://www.patreon.com/braveheartacademy</p>\n<p><strong>Please do note that these screenshots were taken during Alpha.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What you see might and will most likely change for the better!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:35:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b22/b225d90112fc86fe2347552b68c29b38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["BraveHeartAcademy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
