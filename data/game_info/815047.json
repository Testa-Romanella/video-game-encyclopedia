For this game jam, I decided to go for a chess game with a twist based on the theme \u2013 Sacrifice is strength \u2013 where you can make pieces stronger by sacrificing others of the same or lower level, changing appearance with each level. The game\u2019s palette only consists of black, white, and purple to fit in with the Art Restriction \u2013 2 Bit Colors.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology Used</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>Sound Editing: Audacity</p>\n<p>Graphical editor: Krita &amp; Aseprite</p>\n<p>Music Creation: Magix Music Maker</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You can only sacrifice a piece to one of a higher or the same level.\r\n  <ul><li>If the sacrificed piece\u2019s level is lower than the chosen piece the levels of the sacrificed piece will be added to the chosen piece;\r\n  </li><li>The King can\u2019t be chosen to claim the sacrificed piece as he has no level.\r\n  </li></ul></li><li>If a pawn gets promoted, it\u2019ll transfer its added levels onto its promoted piece, for example: if a pawn has 2 added levels and promotes to a queen, it\u2019ll have 8 base levels + 2 added levels, making it level 10 queen.\r\n  </li><li>Same rules as chess (For reference check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Gameplay).\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Asset\u00a0List</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Asset Name</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Description</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Original</strong>\n</p> <p>chessPieceMove.wav\r\n      </p> <p>Sound to play   when a chess piece moves or is placed\r\n      </p> <p>https://freesound.org/people/mh2o/sounds/351518/\r\n     </p> <p>Your_soul_is_mine.wav\r\n      </p> <p>Sound to play   when a piece is sacrificed\r\n      </p> <p>Custom Made</p> <p>Sacrifice.wav\r\n      </p> <p>Main Theme\r\n      </p> <p>Custom Made in Music Maker</p><p>109412__black-snow__sword-slice-03.wav</p> <p>Slash\r\n      </p> <p>Made by Black Snow</p>\n\n<p><strong>Piece Reference List</strong></p>\n<br/><p>Piece\r\n      </p><p>Level/Condition\r\n      </p><p>White Design\r\n      </p><p>Black Design\r\n      </p><p>Evolved Bonus\r\n     </p><p>Pawn\r\n      </p><p>1\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>3\r\n      </p> <p>Move 1 in all directions\r\n     </p><p>Rook\r\n      </p><p>4\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>6\r\n      </p> <p>Can move over pieces of   same color\r\n     </p><p>Knight\r\n      </p><p>6\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>9\r\n      </p> <p>Can move vertically 1   space\r\n     </p><p>Bishop\r\n      </p><p>5\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>7\r\n      </p> <p>Can move horizontally 1   space\r\n     </p><p>Queen\r\n      </p><p>8\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>10\r\n      </p> <p>Can move twice\r\n     </p><p>King\r\n      </p><p>No Level\r\n      </p> <p>\u00a0\r\n     </p><p>\u00a0\r\n      </p><p>If 3 or more pieces have transformed\r\n      </p> <p>When checked switches   places with the closest Rook\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Links</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Github Repository</p>\n<p>Report an Issue/Submit Feedback<br/></p>\n<p>Forum<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T15:37:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/44364d752f79df34bc3aba3b41a5c295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Nuno \"Omega Leo\" Diogo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
