All you have to do is stay away from fireballs. Jump from one platform to another, but be careful not to fall and get hit by the fireball. If a fireball hits you, you start from the beginning. Enjoy the game, very successful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b69/b69c48fe8b8d8adec162ab805e98daae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maximizer0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
