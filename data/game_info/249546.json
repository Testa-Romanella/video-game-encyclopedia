Within the astral plane, the player can see some hints on routes to go, although there is a catch. The players abilities to double-jump and dash consume an energy bar that refills over time. If the player enters the astral plane however, the bar will deplete over time instead, so it\u2019s harder to use skills within the astral plane.</p>\n\n<p>This is made to make the players choose their play style and difficulty freely and dynamically: they can go about the levels slowly, safely and using the astral plane, or they can go hardcore and master the movement to speed through the levels using their autorefilling energy all the time.</p>\n<p>The game is currently a work in progress and more levels will be coming in the near future.</p><p>Made by:</p><p>Sergio Molero Garc\u00eda</p><p>Manuel Escorza Quinto</p><p>Francisco Jose Lavale Narciso</p><p>\u00c1ngel Rebollo Bern\u00e1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/008/008e2f7cf8798acd802514477b4b526d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seruhio"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
