Andou Miyako, junior Makiba Rika, English teacher Aoi Natsuki, same-year student Byakuya Rinne, and classmate Manaka Nemu. All of them were confused by this abnormal situation when a &quot;mysterious voice&quot; suddenly announced to them:</p>\n<p>&quot;The game will now begin.&quot;</p>\n<p>Keisuke must become an &quot;Unlocker&quot; and select one of the women as a &quot;Keyhole,&quot; then perform a specified act with her to &quot;open the lock&quot; so that they can all escape from the white rooms.</p>\n<p>One girl went frenzy over the irrational, extreme, and immoral contents of those acts, lashing out at the &quot;mysterious voice.&quot; The lights suddenly went out, and all the girls shrieked out of fear. When the lights came back on, the first thing Keisuke and the others saw was the rebellious girl from earlier, restrained to a torture device.</p>\n<p>&quot;Withdrawal from the game will result in death.&quot; - the mysterious voice announced.</p>\n<p>The electric current began to run through the torture device the moment after the voice stopped speaking. The girl&#39;s eyes rolled up into the back of her head as she went incontinent, defecating and urinating herself. The women cried and shouted, clearly disturbed by what was happening before them.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Keisuke found himself inexplicably aroused by what was happening to the said girl. For he kept a dark secret. A taste for sexual assault and destructive urges against women... it was his horrible desire that he wanted to keep only to himself.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Keisuke, his classmate Nemu saw right through him this time around. And a cunning woman she is, she won&#39;t skip this opportunity to start using this newfound information so that she can blackmail him and ultimately make him submit to her.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a kiss to seal our deal.&quot; - she said when she suddenly sealed his lips.</p>\n<p>Despite being surprised by her unexpected actions, Keisuke resolved himself to violate the other women as the means of escaping from the white rooms to protect his childhood friend Kanae. Will Keisuke be able to escape unharmed and return to his everyday life? Or will his very desires consume him...? It remains to be seen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-25T11:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d182e17a7d70a2b8fee75a05d2c710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 2, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
