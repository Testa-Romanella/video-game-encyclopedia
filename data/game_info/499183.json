I worked tirelessly during the week trying to make the best experience possible.\u00a0 Enjoy -Dylan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/331/331359583ff9967dc56dccc2d43ac1c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dylsub"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
