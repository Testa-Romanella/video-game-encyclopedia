He has the passion and drive to become one, but armed with only a flame-resistant outfit and a silver fire extinguisher, he lacks the proper tools to safely put out fires and keep buildings from burning down. He makes no guarantee that your home will be standing when he's done with it. He makes no guarantee that it'll stay standing long enough for you to collect your belongings. He does at least guarantee that your house existed\u00a0(if a little on fire) when he arrived.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are John Fireman. Prove you have the chops to be a real fireman by helping out three of your neighbors and rise through the self-appointed ranks to become the best vigilante firefighter the world has ever seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Started 13 January 2021, finished 30 January 2021.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:13:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52b13a817ab34dc113543a025eac6a14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E3kHatena"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
