Between these four decaying walls, they became one with my soul.</p><p>Some\r\n things become meaningless when you hate yourself so much you want to \r\ndie. Your accomplishments, loved ones, possessions... And who you \r\nare. All that remains now are your crimes and your disgrace. No pain you\r\n can inflict on yourself is strong enough to drown out your guilt.\"</p><p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>Right click changes the mouse interaction mode (Examine/Use)</p><p>Tab or \"I\" button opens your inventory</p><p><strong>Technical details</strong><br/>It's\r\n made with pre-rendered 3D scenes (Source engine) and 2D game engine \r\n(Adventure Game Studio). 3D textures and models from leading Source \r\ngames (Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Left 4 Dead) and FakeFactory\r\n Cinematic Mod are used while creating the rendered scenes.
