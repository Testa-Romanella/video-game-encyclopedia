Includes two arcade games; Chaos and Meteor Storm.<h3>Chaos</h3><br/>Not your typical breakout clone. The ball, paddle, and bricks are controlled by physics. Random power ups will fall from time to time which can affect gameplay. Points are gained by catching falling bricks with the paddle; avoid catching the skull and crossbones. Don't drop the ball!<br/><br/>In game music by RedWineProductions and Marc Corominas(MUSIC LIBRARY FILES).<br/><br/>Use the mouse to control the paddle. After all lives are lost pressing the space key will restart the game. Pressing the escape key takes you back to the menu. Pressing the escape key at the menu exits the game.<br/><br/><h3>Meteor Storm</h3><br/>A meteor storm has been spotted moving toward your colony. Man the laser turret and protect the destructible buildings from space rocks! How long can you last?<br/><br/>Use the mouse to point the turret. Pressing the left mouse button fires the laser. Holding the left mouse button down too long causes the laser to over heat. Pressing the escape key returns to the menu.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f52/f524990d0d58e204f1094bb74f38ae75.jpg", "website": "https://cwdigames.com/side-projects/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CWDI GAMES"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CWDI GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
