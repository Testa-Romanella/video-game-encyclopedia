Welcome to GOLD TRIGGER!</p>\n<p>All you gon' needs to play this here game is the space bar on yer keyboard and a USB mouse or trackpad!</p>\n<p>You start the game on top of the swirly wirly BANK icon in the middle o' the play field.\u00a0Direct that chunky METAL DETECTOR a'yours 'round the field with a good ol' fashioned LEFT CLICK, and it'll go wherever you point it!\u00a0Wherever it goes, it leaves a lil' DUST TRAIL behind so you know just where you've been.\u00a0You can try a rapid DOUBLE left click to move faster for a bit, but there won't be NO TRAIL left behind if ya do.</p>\n<p>Yer metal detector's LITTLE RED LIGHT will start to go off when there's GOLD nearby, see?\u00a0Once you unearth that gold by bumpin' into it, that one piece o' gold will be added to your inventory.\u00a0If you decide to go back to the bank, all the gold in yer inventory in that moment will be added and saved to yer overall tally.</p>\n<p>Every time you return to the bank to cash in, all those dust trails will be wiped away, but there'll also be new nuggets o' gold to find in totally random locations!\u00a0BE CAREFUL THOUGH, there'll also be less and less o' that gold spread out around the field, so if ya do cash in, cash in big time!</p>\n<p>There's a catch: if the little red light gets blinking REEEAAAL fast, that means there's a mine under ya! You never know where they could be!\u00a0If this happens, DO NOT CLICK anywhere else whatever ya do, 'else it's gon' blow up and take all the gold in yer inventory away before you can cash it all in at the bank!\u00a0The worst thing that could happen is if your metal detector travels and comes to a complete stop right on top of a land mine!\u00a0There ain't no way to know where a mine is until you step right on top o' one and once you do, you'll really be between a rock and a hard place!</p>\n<p>Them metal detectors don't come cheap, so you only have a few spare to play around with.\u00a0Once they all get blown up, that bank tally will be yer final score and y'all gotta call it quits now, ya hear?\u00a0If you want though, you can tap the SPACE BAR at any time to trade some gold nuggets in that bank for an EXTRA metal detector, brand spankin' new and hot off the shelves!\u00a0But don't get greedy now though, cuz a lower bank tally means a lower end game score and each time you buy a new one, the value goes up by 3 nuggets!</p>\n<p>That's economics for ya!</p>\n<p>Each o' them metal detectors also only got a limited amount of juice to use up before the little red light stops workin'.\u00a0When it does, you can't unearth no more gold nuggets and you'll have no choice but to return to the bank so you can recharge it.\u00a0If you ain't found no gold nuggets to cash in by then, sorry! Them's the breaks!</p>\n<p>BE REEEAAAL CAREFUL when you're goin' around with no juice because now, them land mines can explode right on contact and that little light won't be there to warn you!</p>\n<p>This is where them dust trails should come in handy, so just follow the trail back to the bank as best you can and you'll be right as rain to hunt for gold once again!</p>\n<p>If you ever start to feel the pressure settin' in, you can always pause your game and take an outhouse break at any time with that there RIGHT CLICK.</p>\n<p>Well, that's GOLD TRIGGER for ya! Give her a whirl and have fun, but don't get blown up now!
