Each time you type and submit a phrase correctly (submit using the enter key), your time increases, and you avoid the game over screen for a little while longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keys break as they're used so you'll need to fish new ones out of river.</p>\n<p>Match Three keys on a row to buy some extra time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, this isn't just any ordinary keyboard, and there are a few keys to watch out for:</p>\n<p>\u00a0The Regular Keys (Beige): Regular keys can only be used 3 times. When used 3 times, they will be destroyed. But these keys can be replaced by clicking and dragging new keys out of the river that surrounds the keyboard, and back into place.</p>\n<p>The Sleepy Key (Cyan): Sleepy keys have to be woken up! When placed on the keyboard, you'll have to press the key once for however many \"Z\"s there are above it before using it.</p>\n<p>The Healthy Key (Green): Healthy keys have more health than regular keys. You can use them 6 times, rather than the usual 3 times.</p>\n<p>The Exploding Key: Watch out for Exploding keys disguised as the Healthy green keys! When you place an exploding key on the keyboard, it will begin flashing red. If used, it'll explode and damage nearby keys.</p>\n<p>The Brittle Key(Gray): Brittle keys can only be used once before breaking.</p>\n<p>The Timed Key (Blue): This key can be used as many times as necessary but is only around for a short amount of time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:44:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fd/3fd4ff6a292b009c9b6d28d39ed257ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Les_Polys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
