It took me 36 hours to complete in it's current state and i gotta say it was one hell of an experience, this was a solo entry and i learned a lot, looking forward for the next jam. It is a top-down shooter like Asteroids but with some random enemies with a basic AI, controllers are standard WASD or the Arrow Keys for movement you control the aim of the \"ship\" with the mouse and you shoot by pressing the \"Space Bar\" the whole game was made using Game Maker Studio 1.4</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d4/3d463f111fc75a42a95bba13db5c3be0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceGecko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
