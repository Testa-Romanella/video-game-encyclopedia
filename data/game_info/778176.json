{"id": 778176, "slug": "aircraft-game-project", "name": "Aircraft Game Project", "name_original": "Aircraft Game Project", "description": "<p>A project that I am working on. You can control a F-16 Fighting Falcon while using air-to-air, air-to-ground missiles, guided and dummy bombs, gun pods, fuel tanks, unguided rockets etc. The enemies, which are MiG-29's at the time being, have accesss to 3 air to air missiles, being the R-77, R-73 and R-60, each having their strengths and weaknesses. There are two islands set in the map and the size of the map is 40kmx40km, although it would not be used. The effective map size is around 20 km, without floating origin. The game is played with a keyboard and mouse, it can support a PS3 controller BUT it is not fully integrated, so i would not recommend using it.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse: Guide plane</p>\n<p>Left Click: Shoot cannon</p>\n<p>Right Click: Focus</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel: Switch between armaments</p>\n<p>Q:\u00a0Increase throttle, E: decrease throttle</p>\n<p>Tab:\u00a0Activate/Disable afterburner</p>\n<p>Left Control: Change targeting angle (Useful for picking a specific target)</p>\n<p>T: Enable/disable weapon targeting</p>\n<p>V: Change camera view (cockpit - LANTIRN)</p>\n<p>B: Set position for LANTIRN targeting (to guide AGM-65 and GBU-12)</p>\n<p>X: Deploy flares</p>\n<p>1: Cancel missile lock</p>\n<p>H:Hide UI</p>\n<p>G: gears (not really useful at the time being)</p>\n\n<p>It must be noted that there are many flaws, as the game has shown a great amount of change over the last year. I started out as a prototype for making airplanes, then it became\u00a0 an arcade game and then i suddenly re-formatted to make it a heavier, slower game. The codes and mechanics used changed over time greatly, and the old code shows itself in performance. I am fixing and modernising the code whenever possible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Some references:<br/>MiG 29:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/mig-29-f04c8e99765c4d7e875476998ec5c2f3</p>\n\n<p>HOTAS model: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/phaze...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cockpit model: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cockp...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Parachute model: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/parac...</p>\n<p>F-16: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/f-16-falcon-b04a44ae7e804129ae5f0eb95f9cdf83</p>\n<p>FlightStick:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/phaze-flight-stick-55df0a71f0714e5eaa6ee8e8db52f...</p>\n<p>T-90:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/t-90-tank-d44b337c669145a0b9df9067fbc6349e</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T19:29:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09cb804b471a1716e311ea4daa8f033d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ekmekodlama"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
