In less than a millennium, they will be no human left on the planet. But it doesn't mean they have to die! We can clone them on a new planet!<br/>You are an alien whose mission is to salvage humanity by collecting DNA. Of course, the process can be very painful. If only those pesky little humans didn't try to flee into their houses!<br/></p>\n<p>This twin-stick-shooter was created in 48h for the Discord Jam 4 of 2020. It was inspired by the movie Mars Attacks. You have to shoot humans to turn them into goo, and vacuum their DNA. But the humans keep running off! Try to collect as much DNA before there are no human left!</p>\n<p>The game can be played with keyboard/mouse or XBox controller:</p>\n<ul><li>Move: WASD/Left-stick</li><li>Aim: Mouse movement/Right-stick</li><li>Shoot: Left-click/Left shoulder</li><li>Vacuum: Right-click/Right shoulder</li><li>Help: Tab/Pause</li></ul>\n<p>Made in Unity, it was developed by an amazing team of 5:</p>\n<ul><li>Morgan Hoarau: Gameplay, AI, Polish, Integration(Sound &amp; Art), </li><li>Florian Budzik: Art</li><li>Martin Garnier: Gameplay, Polish, UI, Sound Integration</li><li>Jannah Mekhaemar: UI, Game loop</li><li>Arnaud Demaille: Sound Composition</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e099d1955995e50211dc7b64e20f7d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["steredice", "Nobuna", "martingarnier", "Arnaud Demaille"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
