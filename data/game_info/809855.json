With this in mind, we came up with a game where the odds of winning were very low. For this we created BallTime, in a position with about 2000 balls,<strong> there is only one winner Ball</strong>. As a player, you must find that one ball before the time runs out.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The balls are generated randomly each time so the odds may be in your favor or against you, you may find the winning ball next to you, or that ball may be in the most hidden place in the whole room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move your character with the arrow keys, jump with the space bar, bend with \"C\" Key and move the camera with the mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once you collect the ball you win the game, remember that there is a time limit to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the modeling of the room<strong> Houdini</strong> was used.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you use Houdini to make your game?</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Room Modelling</p>\n<p><strong>List everything that was made before the jam.
