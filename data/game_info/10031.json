{"id": 10031, "slug": "battlerite", "name": "Battlerite", "name_original": "Battlerite", "description": "<p>Battlerite is another contender in the DotA field, but also a spiritual successor to Stunlock Studios&#39; previous game, Bloodline Champions. It is set in a colorful fantasy world, which we see from the top-down view, and is all about gladiatorial arena combat. The battles take place in one of the five areas, each with its distinct visual themes, such as jungle or lava. Each map is centered around the Middle Orb that can be destroyed to gain additional power and will respawn over the course of the game. Matches are divided into rounds and, to win a match, a team has to score three round victories. Each round has a two-minute time limit, so as to push players toward a fast-paced gameplay. When the time expires, a &quot;battle royale&quot; mechanic sets in, shrinking the game area to force the players to meet at the center of the map and fight.</p>\n<p>There are more than 20 characters, or &quot;champions&quot; to choose from, and the roster continues to grow. Those champions include magicians, warriors and everything in between.  Each champion has his or her unique set of nine skills. Timing is important when using characters&#39; abilities, as a low-level skill used at the right time can deal more damage than a mistimed high-level spell.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54fcf1a626faa92afa3f5d2834dbc5ce.jpg", "website": "https://www.battlerite.com/", "rating": 3.24, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 105, "owned": 3430, "beaten": 87, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 402, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 558, "suggestions_count": 553, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 561, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stunlock Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Stunlock Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
