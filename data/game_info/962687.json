Skippy\u2019s Diner is where you will be working. You are a 16 year old teenager who has just applied for the job of making coffee here. It is about taking orders, making coffee, keeping the customers happy, but also while still trying to maintain a clean work space at the end of your shift.<br/><br/>You start off outside of your apartment, you have to get to work on your little red bike, it\u2019s much quicker than walking. <br/><br/><br/><br/>When you make coffee simply grab coffee from the shelf, place it in the coffee maker, and serve when ready. But be aware, customers start to say some pretty odd stuff, it almost feels like the dinner is haunted. You go through multiple days of work. The levels are split up into days, Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 etc. Only on the 5th day things start to go south as Skippy himself finally approaches you, your only hope for survival is to avoid him completely and make it back to your apartment safe and sound.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-26T02:17:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54731201938275c6145295c982b856e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spencer Lockerby"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spencer Lockerby"], "esrb_rating": null}
