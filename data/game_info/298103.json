Every tile and sprite except some bigger one like palm trees have maximum 8x8 pixel resolution.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are a young adventurer ventured into an island found in the middle of nowhere. You beleive it's the island the legend of the great treasure about.</p>\n<p>Your adventure will be \"simple\": collect the treasures as you roam through the tropical paradise and temples and avoid interacting with the local inhabitants.</p>\n<p>The default and only one game mode is hardcode. If one of the local folks gets you, the game resets and you have to start all over.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\r\nkeyactionW, SPACEjumpESCprogramA, left arrowleftD, right arrowgo right\r\n<p><strong>Tools used:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Gimp for the art</li><li>Beepola for the sound effects</li><li>Godot Engine v3.0.6. editor</li><li>ImageMagick for the application icon</li><li>Colour palette used: https://lospec.com/palette-list/links-awakening-sgb</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known bugs:<br/></strong></p>\n<ol><li>Sometimes the player speeds up for a short moment.
