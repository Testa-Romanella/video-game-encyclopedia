And came up with the idea that what if making better poker hands gave you more control over how you control the ball.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I\u00a0had time I would definitely do some tweaks with regards to numbers, power values for high card are probably a tad too low and the high end is probably too much. That curve should just be flatter.</p><p>All the attributes get better with better hands. If you only use a high card for direction, it'll go in the direction somewhere in that arc which more likely than not will not actually be where the arrow is pointing. Improve your accuracy by using pairs, triples\u00a0or if the RNG gods like you maybe even a flush.\u00a0Same thing applies to height just the variance isn't quite as dramatic.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - Camera movement</p>\n<p>QE - Camera height</p>\n<p>Hold RMB - Mouse look</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T07:25:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/951/951685e8c84d73a122d8b9a5173ff58a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lim_ak"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
