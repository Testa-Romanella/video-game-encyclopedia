On top of classical TicTacToe, you can turn up the quantumness to enable new moves! Put your squares in superpositions or entangle them with other squares, and what you thought was a lost game might just turn out to be a win. By playing the Quantum version of TicTacToe, you will be able to build intuition for the strangeness of the quantum realm.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T07:54:39", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["everthemore"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
