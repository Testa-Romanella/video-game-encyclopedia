With a hammer as their only tool, players take control \n      of the brothers and set out to destroy ladders, rip out pipes, knock out \n      walls, and detonate explosive devices. But make sure to plan your path \n      of destruction carefully, as each building is designed as its own clever \n      puzzle\u2014if you're not careful, you can easily trap yourself in a dead \n      end! Adding to the excitement and challenge are fireballs, enemies, and \n      an angry foreman roaming the buildings, all trying to stop you from \n      moving on to the next stage. With 100 buildings to demolish and the \n      ability to construct your own, it's a wonder Mario and Luigi ever got \n      back to saving the Mushroom Kingdom!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
