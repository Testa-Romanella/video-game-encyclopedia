With fantastic art and a story written by the series' original creator, it\u2019s a great entry point into the series!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1973, Earth was invaded by an alien species known only as the BETA. With their massive size and seemingly endless numbers, they conquered most of Eurasia In the span of a few decades, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the rest of the globe falls as well. Mankind\u2019s last hope are the Tactical Surface Fighters: powerful humanoid machines that can stand up to the alien threat. But the enemy\u2019s numbers grow greater by the day, and we\u2019ll need new and better weapons if we\u2019re to have any hope of survival\u2026 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>May 2001. Yukon Base, Alaska, is home to Project Prominence, an international Tactical Surface Fighter (TSF) development initiative. Here, the best pilots and engineers in the world gather to make the weapons that will save mankind\u2019s future. <br/><br/>After his involvement in a fatal training accident, maverick American test pilot Yuuya Bridges is removed from his unit and assigned to Argus Flight, a TSF development unit based in the frigid Alaskan wastes. There, he will work with a joint American &amp; Japanese R&amp;D team to build a new, next-generation fighter for the Empire of Japan. <br/><br/>From the moment he arrives, his cocky, anti-social attitude puts him at odds with the other members of his team, from his fellow test pilots to the project's overseer and his direct superior, the stern and by-the-book Lieutenant Takamura Yui.<br/><br/>Yui is the daughter of a traditional samurai household, who was the only survivor of her unit during the battle where the Empire\u2019s capital was destroyed. Traumatized by the events of the battle and devoted to her family\u2019s code of honor, she\u2019s dedicated herself completely to her mission, which makes her constantly clash with Yuuya. Their constant fighting soon puts the whole project in jeopardy.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Yuuya comes to realize that Yukon Base is rife with international intrigue, as each nation tries to steal each other\u2019s secrets and ensure that when the war against the BETA is over, they\u2019ll be the ones with the most powerful weapons. <br/><br/>As the alien threat grows greater by the day, can he overcome his differences with Yui and complete the weapon that will end the BETA threat forever?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T06:23:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44d54a04b519a3a32a846e9c2c8b05da.jpg", "website": "https://muvluv.com/en/total-eclipse/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 610, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anchor", "fuzz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["aNCHOR"], "esrb_rating": null}
