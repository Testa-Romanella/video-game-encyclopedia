In this game, the player must overcome mental challenges where too many wrong solutions are possible, and a very small number of right solutions are possible. Unlike many puzzles, in this game time is not a problem, there is no need for major reflexes in the player's actions and there is no time limit to complete a level. It is expected that the player spends a little time on each level to understand it, and a reasonable time to solve it. The game rewards the player who has an intelligent view of the solution of the problem not wasting much time on one level, progressing faster and thus feeling rewarded.<br/></p>\n\n<p>TEAM:</p>\n<ul><li>Andr\u00e9 Miguel Coelho Leite (Music and Sound Design)</li><li>Andreas Munte Foerster (Game Design and Programming)</li><li>Rafael Gallo (Game Design, Art and Programming)</li><li>Wesley Tiozzo (Music and Sound Design)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:58:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b97/b971c3f0b8eb50d61bd7bce85c43d4ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
