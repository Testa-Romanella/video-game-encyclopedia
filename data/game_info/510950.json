Use your lures and totems taken from their bodies to gather them and impress them with a mighty terror. The more terror the more these jerks will know to leave your piece of paradise alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Your goals is to terrify and kill campers before morning.
