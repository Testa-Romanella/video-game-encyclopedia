Social media was the main focus of all human relationships, bringing people from different places together in a great peaceful community.\r\n</p>\n<p>But something was formed under that idyllic facade of freedom. Junk emails, spam, deleted comments, neutralized viruses ... The other side of the truth, which always went unnoticed, was accumulating a lot of waste. And... unexpectedly, from that compressed amount of corrupted waste, DEDALIUM was born, an unlimited source of energy.\r\n</p>\n<p>Humanity, dazzled by such power, did not realize that under the shadow of that immense purity, uncontrollable and dangerous forms of infection were also born. And the little things began to fail ... Many files and images became corrupt, social media accounts disappeared overnight, web pages suffered small and untraceable attacks...\r\n</p>\n<p>Chaos started to emerge, the signs that something big was going to happen were too obvious, and fear and anguish took over the world. Those impurities, fed by all the garbage that continued to be generated, grew to become a great threat, a threat that claimed the Dedalium as its own.\r\n</p>\n<p>Humans, far from seeking a universal solution, began to blame each other as responsible for creating such monsters and abandoned the idea of community. So the first Network Guardians were created, shields being installed to keep everyone's information safe. Programmed not only to protect, but also to obtain Dedalium, its use as the mainline of defense and attack began to spread, but this only divided people more.\r\n</p>\n<p>When fear and ambition blinded humanity, and the Internet, the great discovery that would unite people into one, fragmented them to the point of almost destroying them, those creatures felt their desire to rule coming<br/><br/>But their goal was not accomplished as they had planned. A group of powerful Network Guardians, more interested in peace than in greed and power, allied ourselves to restore the order that those beings had devoured. In a short time, we began to be recognized as the Elite<br/><br/>The most powerful of all monsters wanted to get rid of the world's last hope to plunge it back into chaos and attacked with his entire horde. The war was long... Many fell in battle, and others of us were seriously wounded so that we could never dream of the battlefield again...<br/><br/>The Elite knew instantly that if we wanted it all to end, the size of the sacrifice we had to make meant the end of our glory days. We accepted it with honor, and WE WON. The enemy badly wounded, escaped and hid in the depths.<br/><br/>After years of peace, creatures have begun to emerge all over the web, and humans, unaware of their significance, attribute it to small remnants of a past war. But I know well what the real truth is... That ruthless monster is still alive and is beginning to regain strength.<br/><br/>We are no longer around, but that does not mean the fight for peace is lost. Recruiting and training inexperienced Network Guardians is my purpose before the outdated gear I possess disappears. While the hidden enemy recovers to plunge us into chaos, we will create new hope\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T13:44:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/5554e408db60508c1fade31adedb60c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NetworkGuardian"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
