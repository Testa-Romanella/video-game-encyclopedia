Puzzles vary from small to very large, moderately easy to extremely challenging. Mystery photos show off our LOOPical earth.<br/><br/>In each puzzle you will be looking for the one path that winds through all the squares in the grid to make a LOOP. Solve all the puzzles in a chapter to reveal the mystery photo and quote, step by step. <br/><br/>LOOPICAL PRO FEATURES<br/>---24 Chapters - 216 puzzles.<br/>---A LOOPical photo and quote for each chapter.<br/>---Graduated difficulty, medium to extreme.<br/>---Special sections with cool clue combos.<br/>---Big range of puzzle sizes.<br/>---Check your progress at any point in the game<br/><br/>SIMPLE RULES - COMPLEX PUZZLES <br/>---Draw a closed LOOP that goes through EVERY empty square on the board once and only once.<br/>---Some squares hold shiny black or white blocks. These squares are - blocked. The loop does not go there.<br/>---Some squares contain clues that restrict the way you can go: <br/>+Yellow = go this way. <br/>+Red = go straight. <br/>+Blue = must turn. <br/>+Green = three turns or three straights in a row. <br/> <br/>TIPS<br/>---You don't have to draw the whole loop at once. Draw pieces of the loop, places where you know it must go, and then connect the pieces.<br/>---Take a wrong turn? No problem. Draw backwards or use the undo button or the eraser. <br/>---All puzzles can be solved logically, but you can always resort to intuition if you get stuck! <br/><br/>LOOPical Pro is based on the original PC game \"LOOPical\" by Kris Pixton and  KpixGames.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05e/05e1c422151b9cd1c2a4bdf2c84dd6d3.jpg", "website": "http://kpixgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kris Pixton"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kris Pixton"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
