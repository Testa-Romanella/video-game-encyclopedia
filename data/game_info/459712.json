I started learning game development as a summer project around a month ago, but I'm proud to say I've completed my first game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 2020 United Game Jam. The theme of this jam was \"Two\", so as the player, you control two characters as they try to escape Area 52.\u00a0</p>\n<p>**LORE**</p>\n<p>You play as Carl, a single dad, who has been attached to his baby by aliens. The aliens were hugely apologetic, but they refused to remove Baby Juju from your back unless you break into Area 52 and retrieve their stolen alien technology. You successfully made it in (though don't ask me how), and now your mission is to escape!\u00a0</p>\n<p>**CONTROLS**</p>\n<p>The characters move automatically. Carl moves right, and Baby Juju moves left. Click your primary mouse button to swap characters. Press space to jump. If you ever get stuck, the game probably bugged out, but you can restart the level by pressing r.</p>\n\n<p>All assets were made by me, except the fonts (IndieFlower and PressStart2P) which are available for free download on Google Fonts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:55:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e93ed426696eef0e2d7de18b3ef423e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["daloreo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
