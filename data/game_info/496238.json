Unfortunately, you are the <strong>last line</strong> of defense, \u00bfyou don't expected that, uh? Sorry, but the argument is equal simple to the game itself. Never mind, if you have 10 minutes free you'll find some fun battling against <strong>hordes of fun and slobbering invaders</strong>. Make <strong>combos</strong> to get a better <strong>high-score</strong> and try to beat the ten levels to get the <strong>rewarding ending screen</strong>. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is my first project made in <strong>Godot Engine</strong>. Simple, but works and gives fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T04:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edd/edd4b2a56865b5abd6f23725d36f0fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DanySnowyman"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
