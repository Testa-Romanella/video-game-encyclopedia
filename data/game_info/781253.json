It WILL have bugs!\u00a0</p><p>Read below for some controls and how to play. There is also an in-game tutorial explaining the game and each object!</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to keep circles on the screen for as long as possible. But how? Use objects like simple shapes, conveyor belts, jump pads, and more to make cool contraptions with one goal: keep the ball moving and for as long as possible! If the ball stops it is instantly destroyed. But it needs to make it to the bottom at some point so you can collect the money! Have fun, and feel free to share what you make with it. There is a small chance this may be updated in the future, as I am pretty proud of it!</p><p><strong>R TO ROTATE AN OBJECT</strong><br/></p><p>Right-click while having an object selected to delete It and get your money back. Normal destroying doesn't give you anything back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T17:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f8dc5799b9a9d584ae4ebf398983d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Ludorem Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
