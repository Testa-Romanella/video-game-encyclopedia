The theme was \"Collaborate with AI\" and I had already had an idea in my mind just by hearing that. That idea was this game, and I am super happy on how it turned out. I hope you are too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game is very simple to play. All you do it protect a house, that is located in the center of the screen. How to protect it is by killing zombies by click down with the sword on them. Every zombie you kill, your score will go up. Your house has health. It starts at three and goes down every time a zombie gets inside of it. You can heal the house by letting people inside of it. Every person you kill, the houses health goes down. Also, the health of the house can never go over five.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T06:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c56bbf554c7e58e4e86d50fbb849c73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MaseR89"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
