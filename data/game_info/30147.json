Crime runs rampant, piracy and slavery go unopposed and oppresive governments rule. But far worse is the distressing news from Axia that for the past 80 days, not a single package has arrived from Earth. Launched via an acient piece of alien technology known as the Hyperspace Booster, these packages serve as the lifeblood of the Local Group. With travel to earth taking decades by conventional means, the Local Group is now in great peril.<br/>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly 15 days ago, the Axian Central Educational Institute announced that it had evidence pointing to the presence of a hyperspace booster - somewhere in the Local Group.\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n<p>\nYour mission: locate the hyperspace booster.
