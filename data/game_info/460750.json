In other words it is a Doom clone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do not know if it is just me, but I find shooting guys (in games obviously)\u00a0and listening to classical music suitable. So I added classical music to the game. It may sound weird to you, but I find it really entertaining.</p>\n<p>I made the game in Raycasting Game Maker if you are interested.</p>\n<p>The game offers 3 types of weapons and 12 levels. I finished the game in 17 minutes. You can watch it on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Finally I would be really happy if you posted your favorite level in the comments.</p>\n<p>Enjoy...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T03:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b71ff885521fc7cdfffb83d664734cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SomeRandomGuyOnItch"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
