(AstraGamesStudios)", "description": "<p>Hey Guys this is a temp prototype for a game jam i joined (my first jam ever! \ud83d\ude05)! it has a lot of bugs and can hardly be considered\u00a0 a game! This is a multiplayer, so you have to get a partner to play with you! (you can play alone if you want, but it might get boring \ud83d\ude1c) the goal is to destroy the other tank before you get destroyed!!! I hope you all like it!</p>\n<p>I had\u00a0<em>very\u00a0</em>little time to work on it (just moved), but i had fun doing it! Enjoy!\r\n</p>\n<p>Cheers!\r\n</p>\n<p>P.S. i tried to upload it so you could play it on the browser, but when i tested it, it said the file was too large! \ud83d\ude15 sorry about that! But it still works for normal downloading! Anyway, tell me if you think i should continue with the project in the comments! \ud83d\ude01 Cheers!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T22:15:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/322644d294bb5ed391cebacf78a32f06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AstraGamesStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
