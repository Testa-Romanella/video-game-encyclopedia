The monster quantity and positions vary every time you spawn or complete a wave, so every wave is different. Same goes for the mystery and boss boxes. And the waves are infinite, so you can keep increasing your highscore to your capability. Every monster only takes 1 shot to kill, just make sure you don't miss your shot. Make every knife count.<br/>\r\nExpect a really challenging game that takes plenty of practice to get the hang of. It requires players to have good spatial awareness, reflexes, and dexterity to be successful in this game.<br/>\r\nThere will be 2 \"easy\" practice levels that teach beginners how to play. The other 6 maps are the real deal.<br/>\r\nPLAY THIS GAME FOR FREE ON MY WEBSITE https://111144447777a.com OR BUY IT HERE TO SUPPORT A BROTHER", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T02:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4fe/4fe644251dacdaecaf41e513bb712617.jpg", "website": "https://111144447777a.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["111144447777a"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["111144447777a"], "esrb_rating": null}
