Be careful however, don't waste ice cream or you will get punished by a big fat L\u00a0and have to start again! Try to get a high score with the following combos:</p>\n<p>50 points for all three of the same flavour</p>\n<p>100 points\u00a0for all three flavours</p>\n<p>10 points if your cone contains the same flavour twice</p>\n\n<p>Hope you'll enjoy it :)</p>\n\n\n<p>P.S.:</p>\n<p>- AltF4 to quit, the escape key doesn't do anything</p>\n<p>- the score system is a bit slow to start working due to communication between scripts with GameObject.Find</p>\n<p>- playing with a 16:9 resolution is highly recommended to have the best GUI placement, I'm still a noob with Unity and the canvas is blowing my mind lulz</p>\n<p>- lots of Ls in the screenshots, yeah, but the RNG wants to kill me or something xD</p>\n<p>- no audio because I don't know how to put one and what to put\u00a0so you can play your own Initial D music over it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44a2b743ce9fd4dbc84865d445e151b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alluysl"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
