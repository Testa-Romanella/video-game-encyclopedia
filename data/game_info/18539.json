Click where you want to go and Virnu will accelerate/decelerate to arrive at that location. Hazards will come from all directions. Indicators at the edges of the screen will show which direction items are traveling off-screen to help you avoid or obtain them. Use the number keys 1,2,3 to activate power ups after you have obtained them.<br/><br/>Virnu's trajectory is calculated with Newtonian physics. There may seem to be a delay before Virnu moves, especially if she has to overcome existing velocity.Setting<br/>Quip Anomaly takes place shortly after the dark ages of the universe. In this volatile time of new and emerging stars, a particularly curious nebula had within it a unique and confusing anomaly.<br/><br/>The player character Virnu is a Quip, which are sentient spheroid entities that travel freely through space. They consist of a \"quantum brain\" surrounded by an aura that provides sensory input and propulsion.<br/><br/>Virnu is a curious but timid scholar. The game begins after she enters the spatial anomaly. There she discovers this place is not only enigmatic, it's downright hostile.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/387/38770d9d3fa65d643ac5d398dfe27c2f.jpg", "website": "http://quipgame.com/quip-anomaly/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 21, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["mentics"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["mentics"], "esrb_rating": null}
