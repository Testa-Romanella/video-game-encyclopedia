Using these you must ascend to the top. Still looking simple. <br/>By the way, there are three characters. Naturally each comes with their own set of characteristics. The levels. In order to get to the high level, you have to complete the lowest one for all three chars. Why? Our brave heroes are escaping the prison they were put in by the omnipotent world government. For any two one of them to do this by themselves and leave the third one behind would be just bad manners, won\u2019t you agree? <br/>Of course we have monsters. Monsters that jump upon you, bite, explode and do horrible things of every description. Okay. Stop. How is this rouge-like, you ask? Here\u2019s how: 70+ items that affect the gameplay and characteristics; a shop and economy; dying results in death however laughable that may sound; secrets, random events, synergies and so on down the list.
