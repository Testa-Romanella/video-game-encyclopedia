Copter can fly over the game field and leave a trail behind, so you need to draw rectangles with it and occupy enough of free space to beat the level.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut that sounds too easy, doesn't it? Yeah, that's why there are all those enemy drones on the field - they are moving all over the place trying to get in your way, so you'd better avoid them, or you're gonna get WHACKED!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHave we mentioned that there is also a time limit? Yeah, do it under a minute or - yeah, you know it - you're gonna get WHACKED!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, there is also a good thing, lots of them actually - BONUSES and POWER UPS! Speed boosters and enemy slowers, extra coins, extra time and even extra life - go catch them all! But watch out, some could be kind of harmful though.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, once again - fly with your copter, draw straight lines with its trail and capture all the free space you can to win the level! Beware of evil enemy drones on the field, don't let them hit you or your trail (you should not intersect it as well, by the way). Do each level under a minute or get some extra time and other bonuses and power ups, that will add more fun, action and excitement to the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHi-tech flying super copter is against evil enemy drones, you have dozens of exciting levels to beat! Each level has a unique layout and many enemy drones with different abilities, so definitely you won't get bored! We must warn you, it's getting harder with every new level, so you should improve your game to keep up with the action!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHighlights:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Classic arcade game, super popular 90s hit<br/>\r\n- Completely reworked old-school retro hit<br/>\r\n- Modern 3D graphics, optimized for mobile devices<br/>\r\n- 90 challenging levels<br/>\r\n- Smooth gameplay<br/>\r\n- Intuitive and easy to use controls<br/>\r\n- Action driven board battle<br/>\r\n- Kids friendly gaming environment<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you like this game, feel free to check the premium version - more level and completely ads-free experience awaits for you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-28T02:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba678f0db3da04da82186875c7120de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HapGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HapGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
