The world's oceans drained. All that's left is a swarm of brave flounders trying to survive in this hostile environment. Determined to adapt to this new world, they try to flounder their way to the next puddle in order to survive.</p>\n\r\nFlounder to Victory!\r\n<p>The game invites 1-5 players to join a cruel death match for puddles. Will you be the one that leaves the arena victorious?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flounders have a strong will for survival. Their physical capabilities, however, are limited. Floundering through the world only covers a small distance. Time your jumps perfectly to create an advantage and out-flounder your opponents. The movement itself is wonky and odd. It is fun once you become the hang of it.</p>\n<p>As with every species, when it comes to live or death the morale vanishes. When you jump on your opponents you can hurt and even kill them!</p>\n\r\nFlounders seldom come alone\r\n<p>Play against bots or gather up to 4\u00a0friends for the battle. Gamepads are supported.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Samuel Femboeck</strong>: Game Design, Programming</p>\n<p><strong>David Florian</strong>: Artwork, Animation</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Wetzelhuetter</strong>: Soundtrack, SFX</p>\n<p><strong>Lorenz Gonsa</strong>: Programming</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Hofer</strong>: UI Design, Programming</p>\n<p><strong>Lena Ebner</strong>: Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de0/de01d8324a0fb7548dd264558e7077d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samYemmY"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
