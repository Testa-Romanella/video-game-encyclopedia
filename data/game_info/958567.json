The boss combat patterns are not yet finished, so you won't see big difference between normal/hard/warrior difficulty modes. You have already charge attack in this demo, but you would have to unlock it in the real game. Mapping input menu is still a bit messy, working on it. Hope you'll enjoy it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T18:45:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f0/5f01e61b4494a6ff97519df1d24fff1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SylphArcade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
