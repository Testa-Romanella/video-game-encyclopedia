You manage their position, but their stomach is not yours to control. Make sure you time the birds' poop right with the people below it. Some people give a lot of points, but some people might actually sabotage you. And of course, there are drones to wiretap people on their phones!</p>\n<p>For the BirdJam 2022, I decided to not dive into the gameplay, but learn to more polish this game. Therefore, the gameplay might feel a bit off; but at least I learned a ton about polishing a game. I hope you like it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T18:49:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/0261f62d350d4272d2248ebad16e7489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ballon Plantsoen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
