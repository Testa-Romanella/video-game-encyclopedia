You can also press \"Space\" to pause the song.</p>\n<p>Much is to be optimized down the line so any play-testing feedback would be great! \u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T19:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d77af3e46429cfa52b11edab7bc6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zxgnjason"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
