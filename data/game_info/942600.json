Also it might take a minute to load.</p>\n<p>Shotgun Exorcist is a very short, top down shooter made for\u00a0GDKO 2023 Round 3\u00a0in which you play as a little... bean? Oval? Whatever it is, it only has one job, and that's exorcising ghosts. With a shotgun. Pretty straight forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tips: Pressing \"K\" While in the fight will reset the scene if you encounter any bugs.</p>\n<p>(I also didn't test the arrow key based movement so, sorry if you're an arrow key kinda person and it doesn't work out.)</p>\n<p>NOTES: Well, that was fun! I really had a great time making this one. The boss is not really where I want it to be, unfortunately. I would have loved to add more phases and attacks, but time got away from me.(I spent way too much time on everything BUT the boss.) Hopefully, even though the boss is simple, you'll still enjoy the game. Thanks for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T17:44:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4e/f4ed8b531cea2a46384fa164bb58003b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
