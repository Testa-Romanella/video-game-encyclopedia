One day, she encountered a couple of zombies during a walk, tracking their source back to a cave. Kalia proceeded to explore the caves, eventually finding an entrance into a complex of ancient ruins, but getting trapped within in the process.<br/></p>\n<p>With no way back, Kalia must venture further into the ruins in search of another exit. But fortune turns to her favor when she discovers an ancient Fire Staff. Kalia immediately attunes to the staff's energy, becoming able to wield its fire powers. But the staff's energy has been weakened from several millenia of disuse. In order to escape the underground, Kalia must embark on a journey through the remains of a lost civilization, fight increasingly more capable foes, and unlock the staff's true potential.</p>\n<p>Use your abilities to burn your foes! Create and spread fires to amplify your powers, but be careful not to let it out of control. Solve puzzles and navigate the ruins in search of your way out!</p>\n<p>The current build includes a brief snippet of Kalia's journey, set shortly after Kalia's discovery of the Fire Staff. It should amount to 15-30 minutes of gameplay.\u00a0This game is still in pre-alpha and will be receiving more updates as it gets developed, therefore\u00a0many aspects of it are subject to improvement or change, so your feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Soundtrack by tapefilter2000 (on Bandcamp)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T10:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abd/abd811a99a3e3f3604a5c30abec1efc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gdn001"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
