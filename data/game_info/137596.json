Too close to call really</p></li><li><p>I got hung up on trying to use game maker 2 auto-tiling\u00a0stuff. I think this is because I am stubborn. For my next jam, I\u2019ll do some better research to mitigate that.</p></li><li><p>Did you get along well with your team (or yourself)? Why or why not? I worked alone so yeah, I mean my brain was basically fried on day two at midnight even though I felt like I could have continued.<br/></p></li><li><p>Did you ever get stuck in the details of something? How can you help yourself stay unstuck? yeah, the audio was the biggest problem. I need to learn better ways of handling and making audio quicker.</p></li><li><p>What\u2019s something that you spent a LOT of time doing that you could automate or make easier (by changing the process or even writing code to automate it)? this jam I actually didn't have a lot\u00a0of stuff to automate. copy and paste made sure of that(copying my own code and objects, I am not a filthy rapscallion) like the boss thingy is just the cupcake thingy mixed with the jumping cream puff thingy.</p></li><li><p>What\u2019s the next feature you\u2019d add to your game if you continued to work on it? fix all the audio stuff and add some sort of paralaxing\u00a0to make it look more polished.</p></li><li><p>What\u2019s the worst thing about your game? Why? the audio. because it is the thing I do last and the thing I normally don't\u00a0get to in most of my projects.</p></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e82/e82e2d6c5c2558e4f5e6f0bbe2873496.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AplicableToast"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
