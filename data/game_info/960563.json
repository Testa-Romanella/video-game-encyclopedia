The symbols were hidden deep in a sacred temple, to protect everything and everyone around them.<br />\nMany years later, an adventurer named Finn was looking for work in the city of Ambrose. There was indeed much work to do: monsters roamed the country, the threat of war was more real than ever. One night Finn was strolling through the city when he suddenly spotted a young girl attacked by a monster. Naturally, he defeated the monster and saved the girl, who turned out to be a princess hoping to restore her father&#39;s kingdom. The two decide to work together and venture to the nearby city, that lies in ruins, overrun by monsters...<br />\nBoundary Gate is an old-fashioned RPG with dungeon-like 3D layout. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, with the exception of battles, where the heroes can be seen from an &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; view. The attacks are animated. Enemies are random, and combat is turn-based, the party members using equipped weapons to attack or magical spells. Important locations are presented as 2D pictures. There is also voice acting for important conversations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T08:36:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/913/913dd117e3dac1698155773939ca0989.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PC"], "developers": ["Victor Interactive Software", "Palestar"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Victor Interactive Software", "NEC"], "esrb_rating": null}
