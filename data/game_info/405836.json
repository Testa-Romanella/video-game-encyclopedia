Just keep in mind that many advanced moves like castling, en passant, etc are not implemented.</p>\n<ul><li>Why is the game a rogue?</li></ul>\n<p>People call rogue to any game that randomized stuff so I just put it as a joke. It probably should be roguelite but the name was too long.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Why is the game a battle royale?</li></ul>\n<p>Well, Chess has 2 kings battling. You can't have more battle royale than this.</p>\n<ul><li>Is the AI really random? Looks like it uses some strategies!</li></ul>\n<p>Is it completely random. It computes all possible moves for all the pieces and then picks one with equal probability. Any sign of intelligence is just pure chance.</p>\n<ul><li>The game crashed or soft-locked in the middle of a match. What do we do?</li></ul>\n<p>If the game fails during a match please follow the spirit of the game and filp a coin to decide the winner.</p>\n<ul><li>What does \"Escacs\" mean?</li></ul>\n<p>\"Escacs\" is just the translation of \"chess\" to Valencian. I needed something distinctive to add to\u00a0Battle Royale Rogue Chess.</p>\n<ul><li>I watched\u00a0a video from Game Maker's Toolkit that said that developers try make the randomness less frustrating to the player. Are you using any of the techniques explained?</li></ul>\n<p>This game was implemented before the video was released. The randomness in this game is the frustrating one on purpose.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T04:24:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e805e98f7a783c243c58eb5c30ea52fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ximo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
