Instead they use a numerical system called binary, which represents numbers with 0s and 1s. This experience allows the user to explore the complete basics of binary on their own, with a little help and guidance along the way if they need it.<br/><br/>When I\u00a0was younger, I had a mentor, who helped me but also let me make discoveries of my own. If you look close enough, you can see how this game is a tribute to him. I hope others can learn from this game and perhaps find a mentor of their own one day.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Song title: DJ Sona Ethereal <br/>Artists: Nosaj Thing x Pretty Lights<br/>Courtesy of Riot Games (guidelines)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:00:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae3568bc7f470e9a2225606d02eeb658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["plougheed"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
