You need to get to the end of the level by dodging Spikes, Bullets, Turrets, Lasers and more!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game is not easy, as you will need quick reflexes and platforming skills, while also being able to be played casually. You will need to escape precise levels that are designed to test the limits of your abilities. Your goal is to make it to the end of each level by dodging obstacles such as spikes, bullets, turrets, and lasers. You'll also need to use launch pads strategically to make death-defying jumps and reach seemingly impossible places.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the fun (and rage) doesn't stop there! There is also a vast library of community-made levels, created by players just like you using the integrated level editor. With new levels being added all the time, there's practically infinite content being made by players all around the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Airborne has an advanced level editor with almost all features from the base game with the ability to publish your levels to the world using Steam Workshop! You can make pretty much anything your heart desires and share it with your friends - It is guaranteed to make them rage.<br/><br/><br/>If you're a fan of precision platformers and adrenaline-fueled gameplay, then this is the game for you. With its intense rage platforming, interesting level design, and community-made content, you'll never run out of levels to beat!.<br/><br/>the cube can jump btw", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T07:53:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60afcfd07a489381ff3b7e5f29dcd19f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["me", "XDev", "bl4ck"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["me", "XDev", "bl4ck"], "esrb_rating": null}
