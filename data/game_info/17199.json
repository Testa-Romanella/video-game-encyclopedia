ASA is a first-person slideshow adventure game (point &amp; click) reminiscent of famous games such as the Myst and Rhem series. Visit a vast spaceship called The Ark, divided into several areas, and discover the truth behind the Cubes and their creators... <br/>You'll probably need a pen and a paper to write down your notes in order to solve the challenging puzzles! This game can be very difficult for people who are not familiar with the genre. <br/><br/>In 2057, an astronaut finds a strange Black Cube in Space, and is teleported onto a mysterious spaceship called the Ark. You soon discover that he's not the first astronaut from planet Terra to arrive here: Philip Forte lived through the very same experience in 2011 and, fortunately, left a diary explaining his story. With this help, you visit the Ark, with one single goal in mind: getting back home!<br/><br/>ASA: Remastered Edition is an improved version of the game originally released in January 2013 by Simon Mesnard. It is part of the Black Cube series, a collection of Sci-Fi projects based on a book. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Original version features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>9 different environments (6 areas on the main spaceship, 2 planets, 1 satellite)<br/></li><li>10 hours of gameplay<br/></li><li>a story illustrated with several CG movies for a better immersion<br/></li><li>rythmed with an original soundtrack by St\u00e9lian Derenne (Karreo).<br/></li><li>walk in the steps of a disapeared astronaut.
