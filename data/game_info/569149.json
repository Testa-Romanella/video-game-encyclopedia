You need a good internet connection so you can mine crypto coins faster. Buy routers at the shop! Your goal is to get acces to the secret website! Be careful! If you mine crypto coins for too long you can get hacked. If you don't want to get hacked you can use the antihack application available on your computer. The internet can go out if you mine for too long and also the electricity might go out when you use applications too much on your computer. And be careful because people will hunt you down so be sure to check the windows sometimes Good luck!</p>\n<p>\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c</p>\n<p>This game is just a DEMO and I am STILL WORKING on it.\u00a0 You may experience a few BUGS!
