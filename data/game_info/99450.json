{"id": 99450, "slug": "mochi-men", "name": "Mochi Men", "name_original": "Mochi Men", "description": "<p>\"Mochi Men\" is a digital, two player game about risk-taking, trust, communication, and making tasty tasty mochi. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Designed alongside 3 classmates for a class on narrative design in games, I pitched the game and functioned as the creative lead on the project. \u00a0In addition I wrote it, implemented our dialogue system, designed the UI, and handled the sound design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Mochi Men you play as yourself, if you were to show up at the Nakataniduo mochi shop in Japan.\u00a0\u00a0With the help of a benevolent instructor, two players work in tandem to establish a rhythm of pounding rice until it reaches a suitable consistency for making this traditional Japanese dessert. \u00a0If you preform well enough, you might even get to enter the Mochi Zone\u2122 and go on to produce the most incredible mochi your sensei has ever laid eyes on. \u00a0If you injure each other too many times though you'll be forced to stop and figure out how to get a better rhythm with your partner. \u00a0It's been compared to\u00a0Dark Room Sex Game\u00a0of the Copenhagen Game Collective, and while there's no love-making here (well,\u00a0<em>mochitsuki</em>\u00a0is pretty passionate), we\u00a0<em>are</em>\u00a0working on getting motion controller support in the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Most of the inspiration for Mochi Men came from the video below, which is of the mochi shop we based the Master and art on. \u00a0The class Mochi Men was made for revolved around narrative design, and it doesn't take much play to realize there isn't a traditional narrative here. \u00a0The town isn't being ransacked, and making mochi won't save any lives. \u00a0Instead we opted to allow the mechanics to inform the narrative. \u00a0I don't know if this really counts as \"emergent\" storytelling but whatever it is we like it, and I hope you do too!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62f8b081edf4bfe98bb810541d3997c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jimi stine"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
