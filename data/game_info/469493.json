The .png is then used to stamp the elevation of a Polaris terrain tile. The colouring is applied using a height/gradient curve within Polaris.\u00a0The water plane was also added in Unity.</p>\n<p>Standard WASD mouse keys, repeated jumps are enabled if you need to gain some height, suggest playing fullscreen to avoid issues with the mouse moving out of the window.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:35:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f8ef0c10497a408ecbc356ccd0a35df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marjohloo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
