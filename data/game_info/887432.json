No need for a mouse or anything other than your keyboard!</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The goal of Astro Type is simply to type as many words you can. Each word will spawn a star and when the timer is up they will connect to make a constellation.\u00a0Try to make the largest constellation you can!\u00a0Everything else in this game is also controlled by just typing words. For example, typing \"settings\" in the menu will take you to the settings page, etc. If you find the 20 second timer is a bit too short for your liking there are also other timer options in the settings menu!</p>\n\n<p><em>All assets, art, music, and code is my own</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T11:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/9907b16bf39e21745ef81e219cbb7af4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["alexhlocke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
