It is based on the true events of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, February of 1959. Special thanks to Lauren Lark for telling me about that.</p><p><strong>Controls: </strong>Use your MOUSE to find clues in the snow. LEFT CLICK moves your character, and RIGHT CLICK drops a flare (you only have ten!).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This game has randomly-generated elements, so every player will have a slightly different experience. I want this game to be the start of a conversation-- so compare your play-through with a friend's!</p><p>\r\n\tThis game is Public Domain!
