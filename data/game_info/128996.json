Bear in mind when you play this that you are playing something very incomplete. Most cutscenes don't lead anywhere.</p><p>There is no goal in this game, it is just a world to explore- I one day might start this game again, free of some of the problems that plagued it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae4/ae44d8babd02d2b4d6933677e7ba9168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
