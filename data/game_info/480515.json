The title is still a placeholder, and open to change in the future. I'm still new to RPG Maker MV, and really wish to see how my project has been shaping up so far, both in order to learn and grow as a creator. <br/></p>\n<p>Blue Allegiance, in its current state, is about a 2 hour long prologue with a small beginning of chapter one. The game itself is a standard story-driven RPG with a CTB-type battle system with turn orders. The story follows the actions of a newly appointed Captain of the Royal Army in the Kingdom of Leist, a nation recovering from a short-lived civil war. The city knights can no longer keep up with their daily tasks. Calling upon the Royal Army for aid, the main character, accompanied by a small group of newly graduated knights, starts to patrol the Royal City in order to maintain order after the war. While the conflict may be over, the threat hanging over the Kingdom has yet to vanish. \u00a0</p>\n<p>As a big fan of the \"Trails\" games, I've taken inspiration from that series, in the sense that there is a large focus on world building and NPC dialogue. With each major event, NPCs will update their dialogue. Aside from that, readable books and hidden events will also be accessible to the player. Flashbacks are also an important story mechanic. When meeting certain conditions, the player can delve into the past and experience the memories of certain story characters firsthand.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d70a801d9261ee1b56c0a6a868f4567d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Roseille"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
