A disembodied voice tells you that you have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed a terrible crime in the near future, and - according to this voice - the only way you can escape the loop is to convince your future self of the wrongness of their actions.</strong><br/><br/>It seems you have no choice but to follow their instructions, but that doesn't mean you should believe everything they say. As you progress in your conversation with your future self, it becomes very apparent that something is amiss. Someone is lying to you. The question is: who? And why?<br/><br/>If you want to be free, make sure you figure out the truth.<br/><br/>Think carefully. Think strategically.<br/><br/>...and good luck.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------<br/><br/><strong>Your Future Self</strong> is a thrilling conversation-em-up with a unique conversational \"battle\" mechanic. It harks back to the aesthetics of text-based adventure games whilst deliberately subverting expectations of the genre.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f41d0a5941a6b7219f26f18647252f.jpg", "website": "http://www.contortionistgames.co.uk/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Contortionist Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Contortionist Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
