{"id": 115436, "slug": "bitstreamvr", "name": "BitStreamVR", "name_original": "BitStreamVR", "description": "<p>This is a casual virtual reality game; either meant to be played by one's self or with a group of people; with each person taking a turn. The object of the game is to collect as many \"bits\" as possible to achieve a high score! As each round progresses the stream of bits becomes more and more intense! With bits spawning faster and faster and in longer chains. If the player misses a bit they have a few moments to collect as many bits as they can before the player loses a life. If the player loses all of their lives, the game round is over and the player is rewarded their score! If you download the game in the .zip there is a read-me to give you any information you might need. The game does require a 64bit Windows OS. The game does use Oculus touch or HTC Vive controllers as input; if you do not have either the game will not work. It is recommended that you have a 2 meter by 2 meter space. <br/><br/><strong>** Download **</strong><br/><em>Feel free to download the game for free!</em> <em>I left the default pay what you want on it; in case anyone wanted to fund this small game as I work on it.
