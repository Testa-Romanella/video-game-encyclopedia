{"id": 314940, "slug": "grim-tonic", "name": "Grim & Tonic", "name_original": "Grim & Tonic", "description": "<p>Our alcoholic friend Tonic is getting drunk one night in a bar and has one too many drinks for his mortal self to handle as is confronted by a strange hooded skeletal figure who approaches him with a tap on the shoulder. He turns half-headedly to face the Grim Reaper himself, standing before him to announce that his time has come. Tonic, the arrogant stubborn bull he is, demands another drink and challenges death to a drink for his life!</p>\n<p>Match drinks together to get ahead, match poisons and you will fall behind. You have an hour left (although it may seem like a minute) on the clock before the bar cuts you off. Will you have enough time to OUT DRINK DEATH?!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong></p>\n<p>Match 3 or more drinks in a row or square to get ahead of Grim. You have 60 seconds to outdrink him, but watch out for poison bottles because they will make you fall behind. Stopwatches will give you another 15 seconds to drink! Good luck!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>-Credits-</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Writing - Andrew Brito</li><li>Art/Design - Alyssa Cole</li><li>Music/Sound - Joshua Zepeda</li><li>Programming - Caleb Zepeda</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T08:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30cc06ed2954c3200c6f24716ac4d0a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["In-D Gaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
