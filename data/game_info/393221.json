This project is a demo of a potentially larger game. YATPSI was created with inspiration from The Stanley Parable.</em>\r\n\u00a0\r\nConcept\r\n<p>You play as a stranger in a floating facility in the clouds. You only know one thing, that you are the last power safety inspector left in this complex. Your job won't be an easy one, the facility appears to have most of it's power related decisions tied to light ethical questions. YATPSI was originally targeted towards an older audience with most of the ethical questions leading to answers that resulted in a loss of life. However this project was created along-side a clients interests and the target audience was pivoted to be inclusive of a younger audience. Therefor the ethical questions (total of 3 for this demo) have there consequences tied to the various functions and services of the facility.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nClient and Developer\r\n<p>Developer: Max Winzar<br/></p>\n<p>Client: Orian Calvett</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d56311192a5b045623f8f224fa0ca44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Max Winzar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
