To make the sacred journey to save the village from destruction and death.</p>\n<p><strong>You are the leader. Your party trusts you. A choice must be made. Their lives are in your hands.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a narrative driven game, it's a first for us because our other games are generally gameplay focused or arcade styled. So this is a very exciting project to work on. This game features a fully fleshed out storyline with multiple endings. Some might notice that we have hidden a secret ending in there with a special something at the end.</p>\n<p>You will only need your mouse to play this game. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/255/2553f217fd9f9d7de27c11d1f3c2b2eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OverClockStudios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
