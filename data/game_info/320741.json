SPACE!]", "description": "<p>This is a submission for the minijam-28 - \"Pirates\" yet \"no water\".</p><p><strong>Theme:</strong> you are a space pirate, you travel in space and you fight with other pirates. You win some fights (by either BOARDING them or DISABLING enemy ships). But beware, enemy pirates (and others) will try to take you down too.</p><p><strong>Controls and Options:\u00a0</strong>Mouse. Left click on the cards to play them, click on the button to confirm your decision. Each card can attack, move, heal you or others.</p><p>The game is still quite rough and the readability is not ideal. Probably we will iterate tomorrow.</p><p>Devlog:<br/></p><p>21/05/2019, 1:00am: First version submitted<br/>19/05/2019, 11:30am: Started developing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-20T04:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/eced9d494bfd9cf6b7897a2a34b262b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["solroo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
