No one likes\u00a0 bees. On the bright side, you can eat pretty much unlimited cookies. On the down side, maybe bees. Well, in this economy, you're just grateful to have any job at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time to\u00a0 greet your first customer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e2/6e26a772a432ddc5696793e79e225ff3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["gollyzoom"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
