Hearing rumors of a panacea that could cure his immortality, he set out on a quest to find peace deep in the halls of a forgotten lich's tomb. Lacking any notable skills except\u00a0for his prodigious leaps, he's prepared to die as many times as it takes.</p>\n<p>Can be played on controller or keyboard (controller recommended)\u00a0with left/right controls and space/triangle for jump. Hold jump for bonus air! Use precise bounces with your momentum\u00a0on spikes and skeletons to navigate this dungeon.</p>\n<p>Made for Weekly\u00a0Game Jam 130. This is the first game I've made and any feedback and criticism is appreciated, thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:13:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada85756d51525c26ded0848f75457ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dillyPepper"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
