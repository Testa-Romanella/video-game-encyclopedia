She takes comfort in her hobbies, primarily drawing a particular character of her own creation. While she finds enjoyment in creating, she is more reluctant\u00a0about sharing her works.\u00a0 Can you really keep any insecurities\u00a0hidden from middle schoolers, though?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art by Rachel Utzig</p>\n<p>Music by Scotty Two-Socks</p>\n<p>This demo was made in 12 Days for Bubblegum Jam (missed the submission deadline by an hour though).\u00a0If you play this game.. it'll be pretty obvious it is nowhere near finished. I had much, much more stupidly ambitious plans for the jam, but this is what I managed to get done. The idea ended up getting bigger and bigger, and I think\u00a0I only managed to get a fraction of what I hope it will eventually become into this short demo, but hopefully it might spark your interest in seeing a full game! With like, actual options! haha aaaaaa sorry</p>\n<p>It takes just a few minutes to complete, so\u00a0I hope you'll play! Feedback welcome!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e57d1d4a6e7d3e0ade0007848d611b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["One Dove Above"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
