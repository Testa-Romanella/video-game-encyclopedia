See image below.</p>\n\n<p>For food, I searched for a pack that had a large variety of ingredients and final \"meals.\" I\u00a0found a great free\u00a0asset pack on the Unity Asset Store that fit our look and feel. See image below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Zach Gordon: Level Design</strong></p>\n<p>The first thing I did was white-box the level that conformed to all the things we needed. It was the first draft and would be changed before the project came to a close, but it did the job for a glimpse of what we wanted our game to be.</p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots of the white-box, taken from opposite corners for maximum visibility:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Olivia Moriarty: Here are some pictures of the final stylized product!\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I had to scale the white-box down based on limitations from the free asset packs, but overall I was able to import everything fine and put together a large kitchen with multiple food items lying around for you to make your next meal!</p><p>I also edited the buttons and replaced the text to make a sleek look and kept the red and black theme overall. (Edit: We've since added 2 more recipe buttons! See video attached for full gameplay)</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay / Scripting: Madeline Fisher</strong></p>\n<p>The basic functionality of the game was used with a first person character controller from unity's standard asset pack.\u00a0 The player moves with the arrow keys and can look\u00a0 around and pick up items with the mouse. to pick up an item the player just has to click on it.</p>\n<p>The inventory system took a lot of separate components to work properly. I was not expecting an inventory to have so many parts but in the end it looks simple and is easy for the player to follow. As the user collects items the text on that item icon\u00a0will increase in number so the player knows how many of each item they have.</p>\n<p>we wanted to add some randomness to the game so the buttons that create the recipe do not tell the user what exactly they are supposed to make. We wanted to have the player have the element of surprise in having to guess how many items they needed to create the recipe.\u00a0 Once the player has enough items for a recipe they are told what they have made by a text that appears\u00a0and the icon of what they made appears in the right side of the screen.</p>\n<p>The goal for the player is to find all the items to create all the recipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong> Zach Gordon</p>\n<p>The last thing to be done was the audio scripting, once all the interactions had been coded into the game. We had to ditch GitHub due to some last minute issues, but we got things under control with some use of Google Drive. I got my work done just about on time, and I think the audio turned out mostly well-balanced. The biggest challenge of this part was working collaboratively without a proper version control service, of course, but I'm proud of how the sound turned out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1bbef5ee58e4b44f4a5679dff9f0397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadFish21"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
