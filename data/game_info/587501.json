Main goal is to collect coins (the amount depends on the level) and then find a hidden door that will take you to the next map. The game is kept in a dark atmosphere. Ultimately, the mechanics will be based on torches and lighting fires that mark the way to a hidden passage. We plan to add a few mobs and stealth elements, and a combat system in future levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T09:47:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/604/6043b43ba32dec9286d3028004a159c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rias Ryuzaki"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
