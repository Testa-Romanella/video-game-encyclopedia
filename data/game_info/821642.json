Confront the rulebook (with increasing number of rules)\u00a0with information on the sheet and try to spot any mistkaes... mistakes... oops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Small disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>I might've overtuned it a little bit. Seems too hard, especially at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Check your rulebook (on the left) with character sheet (on the right) and spot any inconsistencies. Click on an incorrect element and reject the character sheet or approve it if everything seems to be in order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/serpentsoundstudios/royalty-free-medieval-tavern-music-ta...</p>\n<p>Sounds: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/</p>\n<p>Made with Godot &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/572a8f8d5eb8462129343fb4b854f636.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MonsieurPazur"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
