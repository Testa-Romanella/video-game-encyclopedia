It's because the pirates stash all their treasure in the trees! <br/>Few people know this, but one crab does, named Clawrence. He's greedy for Gold, Diamonds and Rubies, and he's found a great spot to catch them as they fall - if it weren't for all the pesky coconuts that fall at the same time!<br/>Help Clawrence dodge falling coconuts, weave through airborne mazes and play beach ball keepy-uppy, and if you're really good, collect enough treasure to secure a place on the leaderboard!<br/><br/>Some functions and features may not be available on PlayStation TV.<br/><br/>1 player(s)<br/>Network Features<br/>2048KB Minimum<br/>Touchscreen<br/><br/>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com/support/useragreements.
