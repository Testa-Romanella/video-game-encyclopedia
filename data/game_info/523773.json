And a whole lotta viruses to kill. In this top down shoot em' up you play as Lucas White, the last blood cell left in an unknown human body, determined to defend the red blood cells as they try and repair the body. Use a variety of weapons ranging from shotguns and glaives to slay each unique type of virus before they can eat the red blood cells, but watch out, once the red blood cells are finished with their work, a bigger problem awaits. A MUCH bigger problem.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:34:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/922/922c4444276d78d0a41c5a24e78783e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlexirYo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
