It puts you in charge of making your restaurant the best dining destination in town. Build and decorate, manage staff, keep your facilities clean, serve delicious food and more.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Build</strong><br/>You start with a small, empty plot of land. You'll need to build your restaurant from the ground up by placing walls, doors and windows. Once you have that hard-earned cash, you can buy more land and grow your restaurant.<br/><br/><strong>Decorate</strong><br/>Guests want more than just good food - they care about your restaurant decor too. Make sure your restaurant is well decorated to keep them happy.<br/><br/><strong>Hygiene</strong><br/>When you don't clean your restaurant, it will get dirty. This will attract rats. Guests won't be happy to see rats, so it's probably a good idea to keep your restaurant<br/> clean.<br/><br/><strong>Menu</strong><br/>Creating a menu seems simple, but a poorly thought-out menu is the death of many restaurants. Pick your dishes carefully and make sure they are the right price.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T03:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/555dfc88ff1b5f5aacd995d31974863f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Celestial Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Celestial Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
