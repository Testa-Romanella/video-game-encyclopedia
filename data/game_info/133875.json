I was the only one that knew that far down under the city was a frozen maze. An old labyrinth that occupied my thoughts day and night and that contained something sentient and very dark. Something that originated from my own self, that I one day had to confront. That day came and I took the decision to descend and dressed in my grandfather's old green parkas I walked deep below the city to those icy corridors. To confront myself and the shadow within. </p><p><em>\"Deep Below a Dreaming City a Shadow Lies Untold\"</em> is a simple graphical homage to those games I loved and still love from the 1990s, like <em>\"A Link to the Past\"</em>. But it's also my game based investigation and symbolic representation of the jungian concept of meeting your own shadow within.</p><p>I humbly hope that you will enjoy it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd8f0b216affcf1f301d641ff02e597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Cyxos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
