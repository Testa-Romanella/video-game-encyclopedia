You can make that happen. This game was inspired by hundreds of stories people have shared - including those who struggled with MMO addictions. Our character has thankfully overcome that problem, but their life hasn't gotten any better.</p>\n<p>I want to stress that this is *just* meant to represent a day. Depression can't be cured in a day, and it won't be in this game. It probably isn't fun to play. It isn't meant to be.</p>\n<p>Reviews:</p>\n<p>\"An awful gaming experience.

You don't get a cool medieval space expedition game called Merlin's Explorers and the Mysterious Planet. You get the crushing despair of doing all that work only to come up short.
