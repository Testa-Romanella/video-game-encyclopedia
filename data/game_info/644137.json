Some say from animals, some say man-made in a factory, some say an act of God. The vast majority of the population of the planet died within months. Those that remained either \"Turned\" vicious and feral, or if immune to the pandemic, live their lives as bandits. All are dangerous.</p>\n<p>You and your partner, Jo, are both immune. You survived through looting and using your own initiative. You were eventually captured by bandits, a group led by John Hardin. Having been captured by bandits, one night, you took your chance to escape. You made it. Jo did not, remaining a prisoner of the bandits. The hard truth is that John Hardin has moved on, to a place unknown, with his group - and Jo.\r\n</p>\n<p>You have little to live for other than finding Jo, finding a place to call home, and find happiness once again.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Join the Discord server for frequent (at least weekly) updates and download for free:\u00a0</strong><strong>https://discord.com/invite/xaJP3t5</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>GAME NOTES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game is in development and provided as early access.
