So, I thought about what kind of game you could play on a keypad, and the idea came:<br/></p>\n<p>A game where you enter codes to perform different actions.</p>\n<p>For me, this naturally led to a sort of Metroidvania/TLOZ style where you unlock abilities to progress further in the game.</p>\n<p>I'm... not expecting this game to win, or even get close. But that's not what this is about, for me.</p><p>I stand by the concept, but just wasn't able to really test it or refine it within the week I had to make it. So, I'm not very pleased with my work this time around, but here it is. Maybe I'll revisit the idea someday.</p>\r\nBefore you say...\r\n\"It'd be nice if\u00a0you could keep track of codes.\"\r\n<p>I originally intended on having a pause menu where you cold review documents/hints you'd found, but I didn't have time to implement it. If I update the game in the future I'll be sure to add that in first.</p>\r\n\"There's no audio, you could've at least done something basic.\"\r\n<p>I'm perfectly aware. However,\u00a0I really didn't have much time for it, and I believe that having a silent game is better than having a game with audio that doesn't fit the mood or is grating/annoying.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T10:23:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Detective Software Devs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
