You harvest souls then send them Up or Down. That's it.\r\nBut after a while, you started to believe some souls were being\r\nunfairly judged, so you created Scare City, a secret place for those\r\nsouls to live out their non-existence in peace.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Satan has found out and\r\nhe wants all the souls. Now you need to re-harvest all the souls once\r\nmore before the devil's minions claim\u00a0them for their master!</p>\n<p><strong>Death moves towards the mouse cursor.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Demons move towards souls.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Souls run about like frightened idiots.</strong></p>\n<p>Play through five neighbourhoods and see how many souls you can save!</p>\n<p>Made in about an hour for HEART JAM - the theme was scarcity, and this is what idea farted into life in my brain. I'm pretty sure it all works properly, but if not I'll rejig it soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, it looks like balls.</p>\n<p><strong>-------------------- v2 update!!! --------------------</strong></p>\n<p>v2 has bug fixes, namely:</p>\n<ul><li>Souls no longer leave the screen, as sometimes once they did they never returned.</li><li>The Player is also clamped to the screen, so as to avoid issues with the camera not finding/following them.</li><li>Level change conditions now correctly implemented (once a certain number of souls are harvested/destroyed, you move neighbourhoods, until all five have been visited).\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>No other tweaks made, so it still looks super cheap haha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:30:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e98aa308c21ff3165028c3c7af5f1a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Atomic Toilet"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
