There is also a cliffhanger after the third man.</p>\n<p><strong>Information</strong></p>\n<p>This was made under a week for the Summer Slow Jams, I've had a very eventful month, and I\u00a0couldn't give this full attention.\u00a0It is \"functional\" in the sense the main features of a JRPG are here, but it lacks way too many features I've had in mind at first. You can enjoy these barebones by downloading the file on this page. This page will not be updated even if I think about continuing the project.\u00a0I'll make a new one for the subsequent and this time feature-full versions of the game.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Unless stated otherwise, the controls are:<br/></p><p>Left Click to interact with elements such as units or the Command Center<br/></p><p>Right Click to go back from any menu</p><p>S to bring out the other commander's stats.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Othmane \"Singleton\" Filali Benaceur - Programming, UI, Game Design</li><li>Hot Shack - Art</li><li>Aniss \"Schyzox\" Aoudjehane - Music (Theme of Ali)</li><li>Louai \"thesadclown\" Elachkar - Music (Theme of Saif, Theme of Unleash)</li><li>TheUnlucky69 - Music (Victory)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:03:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72b/72b03cf5690a6013e68703de7d63e940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hot Shack", "Singleton"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
