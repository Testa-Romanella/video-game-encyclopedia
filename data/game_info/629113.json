After attempting to play your game, you ran into a fatal error that crashed it all. You must venture into the debugger to CLEAN UP YOUR CODE! Collect donut to satisfy your belly but dont forget to get rid of those nasty errors as well. You will have to switch back and forth between code mode and game mode. And remember, never leave a donut behind.....</p>\n\n<p>DEVS :)</p>\n<p><em>Debugger\u00a0</em>was made by two high school students for the BenBonk Game Jam\u00a0It.
