{"id": 767215, "slug": "look-up-2", "name": "Look Up!", "name_original": "Look Up!", "description": "<p><strong>Developer's note:</strong></p>\n<p>Look Up is a classic asteriod shooter game and my entry to Ludum Dare 50 \"Delay the inavitable\". This is my 4th LD entry. My previous entries were fully focused on producing a creative or a different, unique idea. Because of this they were generally partially polished. Even one of them was unplayable. This time I go with the first idea I came up with and tried to\u00a0create a relatively more polished game than the others. So I focused on visuals, gameplay, difficulty curve and optimization. Hope you'll like it.</p>\n<p>Look Up was originally\u00a0 a compo entry. Unfortunately I discovered a game breaking bug while 30 minutes remaining to the deadline. So I have gone for a bug fix next day and submit to the jam. But Look Up is developed by one person, there is no ready assets used and developed under 48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Game guide:</strong></p>\n<p>Scientists say we have no chance with this meteor rain. But goverment started a mission and launched a weapon to the orbit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are in charge of the weapon. You realize you can upgrade the weapon with the IRON collected from the meteors. Also your team discovered GOLD in some of these asteroid which governments love. So you can sign some contracts with them for small improvements. Press ESC for upgrade menu.</p>\n<p>You shoot with LEFT CLICK and hold RIGHT CLICK to use a nuke. But you should upgrade your weapon first.</p>\n<p>Good luck and God save us all...</p>\n<p><strong>Logic:</strong></p>\n<p>Game idea originally inspired by recently published science fiction movie Dont Look Up. General idea is defending the earth from asteroids. Asteroids spawn rate and health increase while you upgrade your weapon with materials you collected from same asteroids. so there is a classic power up and face harder level cycle. If you power yourself up wisely you will survive longer and longer. But eventually it is an endless shooter.</p>\n<p>I hope you will have fun :D</p>\n<p>Game On!!!</p>\n<p>\u00c7\u0131nar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T22:17:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45d26785cbe56b37858a6550ad42136.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cyaygel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
