Use other blobs to destroy buildings by dashing into them to pick them up and throw them around. Sometimes you'll need to use specific combos of blobs. If you get surrounded, don't be afraid to throw blobs into walls to kill them.</p><p>P.S. The objectives later on look like dicks. I'm sorry about that, it wasn't intentional. Or was it?
