It will not be so easy to do this, because there will be a lot of orders and you will have to have time to serve everyone, because if you do not have time, you will not only lose loyal customers, but also the trust of the bar employees.<br/><br/>For each well-executed order or right decision, in a dialogue with mentors, you will gradually increase their level of confidence in yourself. I wish you a good time in the company of nice girls, and good luck in conquering their hearts!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T04:16:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0bb616984e52daa47438c17ecbf37eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crooked Road"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Piece Of Voxel"], "esrb_rating": null}
