She's been working so much lately that sometimes she's too tired to even cook for herself. Ernesto, being the loving grandson that he is, decides he will make three dishes to take to her. However, his only mode of transportation is using his legs! So you must help Ernesto get to his Abuela's house as fast as possible!</p>\n<p>All music created by Ricardo Aviles</p>\n<p>Note to players:</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing this game made for the Latinx in Gaming Unidos Game Jam.
