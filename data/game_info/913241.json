Little does he know that he is about to embark on a terrifying journey as he stumbles through a strangely familiar forest, campsite, and industrial complex. Will he make it through? Or will he be swallowed by whatever lurks in the shadows?<br/><br/><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong> <br/><br/>Snowy Night features challenging gameplay that calls for a lot of trial and error in order to complete the game. You will find yourself running through four different environments (Town, Forest, Campsite, Industrial Complex). Your objective is to collect items to aid in your escape whilst trying to avoid being caught by whatever lurks nearby. Each scenario has an AI enemy that functions differently. It is up to you to learn it's attack patterns/habits. The only way to learn is to die. There are also mechanics that make the game all the more challenging including:<br/><br/>     -  <strong>Sanity</strong> (Decreases at a slow constant rate)<br/><br/>     -  <strong>Stamina</strong> (You can't run forever)<br/><br/>     -  <strong>Unique AI</strong> (Every scene, the AI has different behaviors)<br/><br/>     -  <strong>Large/dark maps</strong> (Making searching for items incredibly difficult)<br/><br/>     -  <strong>Alternate endings and secret paths</strong> (Offering extra lore bits to piece together the story)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T03:53:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c46dacc0ea5d2f9f9ad16babb72f7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rage Games Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rage Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
