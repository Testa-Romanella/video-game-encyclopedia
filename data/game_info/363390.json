Choose a background and stat, then live your character's life 5 years at a time. Follow the path of a peasant turned soldier, or choose a life of contemplation and prayer. Be a craftsman, an alchemist, a knight, an inquisitor. Your choices decide your skills, and your skills protect you through the dungeon!</p>\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n<p>Choose your approach. Kill any in your way, or charm your way through the dungeon. Craft deadly potions as an alchemist, convert hostile foes as a priest, or bribe those foes as a merchant. Gather a group of protectors or finish it solo. Use magic, might, charm, or money to reach Perin!</p>\r\nWhat's to come?\r\n<p>More monsters, more loot, more magic! In short, more content and challenges to overcome.</p>\n<p>The current version of the game is an \"alpha\" version: beatable, nearly feature complete, somewhat untested.
