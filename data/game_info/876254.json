I will release games biannually to show the progress of the engine.</p>\n<p>This first game follows the protagonist\u00a0Aehlehli Sadiline off on a trip to another dimension. At this point she is maliciously compromising a segment of\u00a0it for reasons not stated. Before she leaves she wants to collect the \"fruit\" of her decision, this \"fruit\" has \"particular uses\" for \"particular people\" and decides where she ends up at the end of the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ideally she would like to leave with her boyfriend Sean however. Both she and he are displayed on this page currently. This is a proof of concept I guess, I am committed to growing both the engine and the world.\u00a0I think the next few games will follow these two goobers until I reach a completely new stage in the engine. of course, who knows? we will see...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T18:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/210f51d039c8b9c12fae0c04f71a0c44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xierenisis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
