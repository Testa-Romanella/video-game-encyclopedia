Whether it\u2019s smashing it up against walls, catching it on <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>dropping </strong>it off of towering buildings, letting it soak in <strong>puddles </strong>or <strong>electrify </strong>it with the conveniently placed electrical boxes, that\u2019s up to you! Make every second count though, because it is a race against the cloak to get each perfectly mangled packages to the intended locations.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tWith each package you drop off, the more you <strong>anger </strong>your customers, Hell hath no fury like a \u201cKaren\u201d scorned! These said \u201cKaren\u2019s\u201d have made it their mission to make your job infinitely more difficult by <strong>stealing </strong>back the packages and running off with them, so be careful!\u00a0\r\n\tEach dropoff point will be marked by a <strong>glow </strong>whether it is at a door or window, you must drop the damaged loot off and then go pick up another back at your delivery truck and do it all again. </p>\n<p>____________________</p>\n<p><strong>CREDIT:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Chase Hawley - Game Designer &amp; Programmer</p>\n<p>Walker McDonald - Game Designer, Tech Artist, &amp; Programmer</p>\n<p>Suraj Karthikeyan - Programmer &amp; Game Designer</p>\n<p>Marie Loop - Artist\u00a0[Character, UI, Environmental Hazards, &amp; Cars] &amp; Sound Designer</p>\n<p>Caiyin Lang - Artist [Environment]</p>\n<p>__________________</p>\n<p><strong>SOUNDS USED:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>One |\u00a0Two |\u00a0Three |\u00a0Four |\u00a0Five |\u00a0Six |\u00a0Seven |\u00a0Eight |\u00a0Nine |\u00a0Ten |\u00a0Eleven |\u00a0Twelve | Thirteen | Fourteen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T16:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af21aa1ad05aa1f453181a7ff74e622.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["loopmari", "hawleych", "DWalkerM", "Caiyin Liang", "Suraj Karthikeyan"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
