Every 10 seconds you are dragged between 2 different realities, with the world around you resetting each time. In both you face mortal peril and a mystery. You must solve the mystery of each realm and find a hidden potential within yourself to break free.</p>\n<p>This is a SNES game created in C using PVSNESLib. So you'll need either a SNES emulator or Flash Cart and a physical SNES if you want to try it out.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: This is currently a BETA version submitted to Ludum Dare 51. A more polished version will be released next week.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>P1 CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>d-pad - Movement</li><li>b - Look</li><li>a - Interact</li><li>y - Inventory</li></ul>\n<p><em>(small spoiler / warning: This game will be a little easier to complete on a real SNES but with some tweaks you'll be able to do it on emulator too)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T08:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63c/63c162c19dc3592a63687efdecdf2be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Locked Door Puzzle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
