Temporarily turn off or increase gravity on your way to getting the fastest possible time.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t**Note: Since this is a demo, I've removed most of the progression so you can play whatever you like. In the  main area, jump into the spheres to begin a level. Blue (Day) spheres will be easy, Orange (dusk) will be more challenging remixes, and Black (Night) will be the most difficult version.</p><p><strong>You can quickly restart from the pause menu!</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls (M+KB)</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Move - WASD</li>\n<li>Look - Mouse</li>\n<li>Jump - Space</li>\n<li>Float (Turn off gravity for one second) - Hold Space while airborne<br/>\n</li>\n<li>Sink (increase gravity) - Right Mouse Button</li><li>Pause - Esc</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Controls (Xbox 360 Controller)</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Move - Left Stick</li>\n<li>Look - Right Stick</li>\n<li>Jump - A button</li>\n<li>Float (Turn off gravity for one second) - Hold A while airborne</li>\n<li>Sink (increase gravity) - Right Trigger</li><li>Pause - Start</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tFinally, Rad Roller is on Greenlight.
