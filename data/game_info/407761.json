Robot Death Arena was born of my post-game jam excitement for Unity game development. It was never honestly meant to amount to much, it was meant as a tool for me to learn (as well as a dumping grounds for mistakes I'd rather not make on future projects).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>However, after a while the game grew to a point where it felt like a shame not to at least compile it and share it here on itch. So here it is - the current version (0.1) of the game. It's very feature incomplete, asset incomplete (missing sounds/effects, etc). But it basically works. The interface is atrocious, but again.. it is what it is.. for the time being.\u00a0The project is on hold for now while I explore bigger and better things, but I may return to it in time.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, let me know what you think of this very early prototype!
