This adds a little replay value that we intended to pair with adding special interactions when certain items are put together (ie 3 kitchenware items), but this ended up being out of scope for the game jam. When trying to move large items across rooms, the player needs to be a little creative. In other words, push them out the window and dragging them in from the outside, which ended up being quite funny.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>3D Art: Casilda de Zulueta, Luci Zhai<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay &amp; Tech: Robert Bazoiu, Alexander Kappen</p>\n<p>Level Design: Robert Bazoiu<br/></p>\n<p>Music: Robert Bazoiu</p>\n<p>Writing: Casilda de Zulueta<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25dbb3e558a4c92d46984e9ce8534c10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobertPhillipB"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
