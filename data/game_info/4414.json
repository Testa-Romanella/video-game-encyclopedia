Although Episodes from LC is not a direct sequel to the series, it is slightly connected with the original GTA IV. Despite having the same game setting as in the previous GTA chapter (the action takes place in Liberty City approximately at the same time), the city itself faces some cosmetic changes. Several new details (new vehicles, weaponry and mini-games) were also added to the gameplay. The game also has better graphics and optimization. Episodes gives players an opportunity to dive into the atmosphere of crime, which Liberty City is famous for. The game includes two separate storylines: The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. In The Lost and Damned players take control of Johnny, a member of brutal biker gang The Lost, who has to fight against rival gangs for control of a city. Ballad of Gay Tony experiences playing for Luis Lopez, who tries to find himself in the world full of violence and obscenity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/470/470d21d6971de8f13ec0e1664a120cc0.jpg", "website": "http://www.rockstargames.com/episodesfromlibertycity", "rating": 4.11, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 197, "owned": 2718, "beaten": 616, "toplay": 68, "dropped": 148, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 598, "suggestions_count": 226, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 602, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Rockstar North"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
