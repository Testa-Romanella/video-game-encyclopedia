{"id": 757887, "slug": "super-mario-infinite-crawler", "name": "Super Mario Infinite Crawler", "name_original": "Super Mario Infinite Crawler", "description": "This Game started out as an adventure to see how Mario-like I could create a level.\u00a0 I enjoyed it and started making my own tweaks. Mario is now stuck in a level that repeatedly gets harder as you beat the boss. You can unlock Powerups that buff your boss damage as well as a special suit that allows you to become a super hero. Buff are all permanent - once you find them you will have them even after you die and restart. You can locally save to keep these items for next time by clicking 'Shift 5' and load by click '6'. This will only save your buffs not your location in a current run\u00a0(Not a save state).\n<p>Secrets: There are 3 Attack Buff Secrets in the game and 1 suit currently built into the game.</p>\n<p>Levels: Currently there is the original level and 2 more difficulty levels after. You can continue to climb difficulty levels but the game will\u00a0 just be a repeating difficulty 0 after, until you die.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer:</p>\n<p>All graphics were made by hand but Nintendo owns \u00a0the creative rights to Mario. I will never attempt to charge anybody for this game and there is always a chance Nintendo will request it be removed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do plan to continue to add to this game to create more difficulty levels, add a few extra hidden bonuses,\u00a0 and some extra enemy types.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T11:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad4444ceb64c4cb7407de01187b7db3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Winstreak !"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
