Players must utilize a variety of food-based weapons to eliminate the terrorist threat and restore order to the food establishments. Killing terrorists will yield points that can be spent at the Upgrade Bench to improve the player's weapons and abilities. However, as players progress and upgrade their weapons, the difficulty of the enemy forces will increase. In the event that a player runs out of ammo or points, they can visit the suspicious man, a mysterious figure located in an alleyway, who will exchange half of the player's health for 100 points. </p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER :\u00a0</strong>You need a Quest headset to play it with Link/Air Link. You can try with other headsets, such as HTC Vive and Valve Index but for it it didn't work.</p>\n<p><strong>Very Early in Development.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </strong>Leave a comment about what you liked, and didn't like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T13:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/35774f13e71acdf58ec0cbce06627b07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr.Lonely"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
