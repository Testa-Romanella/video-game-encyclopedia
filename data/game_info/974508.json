We received tram size, appearance data, behavior, and speed limit information from Hakodate City Tram. Tram sounds were recorded using actual trams, supervised by Hakodate City Tram staff.<h3>Focus on Sound</h3>Tram sounds are recorded from real trams. We adopted sounds recorded while walking along the tram line and while driving alongside the tram. Under Hakodate City Tram staff supervision, we recorded sounds near the bogies, which are not possible during regular operation. The in-tram announcements use the voice of Naomi Ueda, the actual announcer. For the driver's voice, we used recordings from J\u014d Hibiki, a former train driver and railway talent active on YouTube and radio.<h3>Attention to Scenery Along the Line</h3>Buildings and stops along the line are individually created.<br/><h3>Focus on Traffic Signals</h3>Traffic signal cycles are based on local measurements. Each game start changes the cycle start time, altering driving patterns.<br/><h3>Developed by a Hakodate Native</h3>The developer spent their childhood and student years in Hakodate. Familiar with the Hakodate City Tram from a young age, they deeply understand how to express its uniqueness. Breaking free from traditional railway simulator concepts, the developer tries various innovative ideas.<h3>Product Information</h3><br/><strong>Driveable Routes</strong><br/><br/>The full length of the Hakodate City Tram is 10.9 km, but the game only covers a portion of this. <br/>As of Novemver 2023, players can operate trams between Hakodate-Dock-Mae and Hakodate-Eki-Mae.
