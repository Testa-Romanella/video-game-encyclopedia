Unfortunately, due to some... unfortunate circumstances, the robotic frame that it is dropped into is rather old and is missing all of the important drivers that would otherwise allow it to move freely. Navigate through the world trying to get to an exit from the old facility, and maybe pick up some controls along the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours from scratch for Ludum Dare 45</p>\n<p>I am fairly happy with how this game turned out. This was my first foray into both pixel art and audio, and I think that both turned out quite well for a first attempt. I think that the game that I ended up making suffered a little bit because of my focus in these areas, but I am very happy that I learned what I did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun with this project, my 7th completed Ludum Dare game. Any constructive feedback or questions are appreciated, and I will try and get back to comments as soon as possible. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow keys or WASD to move.
