You sometimes also need put extra dice in slots for\u00a0enemies' actions.</p>\n<p>You have a limited amount of dice. You can hold up to 3 dice in hand at a time. When you run out of dice, extra dice added from the deck (amount of dice in deck is displayed on your right).</p>\n<p>To move a die, you need to click on it and then click on an empty slot. Be careful, you can't take it back!\u00a0\u00a0After you use up a die, it goes to a discard pile (amount is shown on your\u00a0right).\r\n</p>\n<p>The same idea of movement is applicable to equipment and equipment slots.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n<p>In dungeons, press \"Continue\" button to proceed. Do it until the end of the dungeon.<br/><br/>In non-battle rooms, you need (sometimes it is optional) to put a die to check success of some action and then go further.</p>\n<p>When dungeon ends, you can visit shop and tavern to upgrade your dice and equipment. Notice that you can only equip your\u00a0items in the village.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then you can go to the dungeon again.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tooltips</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Hover cursor over a die or an item to see info about it.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Death &amp; Goal</strong></li></ul>\n<p>After death, you will lose your\u00a0equipment, but save half of your money and all your dice.
