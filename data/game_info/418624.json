An eerie silence haunts the air. The stench of death infects the air. The hair raising sound of a blade being drawn claws at your ears. Banacath. The god of the underworld. This is it. If you can't defeat him. Your world is doomed to a new age of darkness, wrought with pain and suffering. You must survive...</p>\n<p>Sorry if that was a tad dramatic, or boring.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is about one man, who carries the world on his shoulders (not literally). For he must save this forsaken planet from The Eternal Dark. Follow this hero as he solves mysteries, battles and makes friends along the way.
