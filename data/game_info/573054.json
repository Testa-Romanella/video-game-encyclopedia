This was my first ever game jam and I have learned so much. The game and graphics could use some serious polishing, but that's probably never going to happen. The game is a tower defense game with plants that shoot at zombies. I'm sure you know what game this is, but I don't want to get copyrighted so I won't use any of their terms. It was made as a Mintendo game (another company I don't want to be sued by). Thank you to anybody who plays it, it means a lot to me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:43:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f21e5bf0c62f66de86aae5f92fecb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aengus126"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
