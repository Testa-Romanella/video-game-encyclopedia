Can you save them from the evil Squaries \n      by triggering a devastating chain reaction?<br/>Furries are cute, \n      happy, round beings that enjoy rolling around in the sun all day long. \n      But the bad-tempered, stone-cold Squaries, hating everything that is \n      round and fluffy, attack the unsuspecting Furries! Now it is up to you \n      to create chain reactions that will pop the evil invaders. Prove your \n      skill in four different game modes: Classic, Challenge, Time Trial, and \n      Endless.
