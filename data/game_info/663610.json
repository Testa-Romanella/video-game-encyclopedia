This was a personal game jam. I gave myself  4 days to design and develop a game. I also gave myself the restriction  on a single art source for the game. A finished project is something  that is playable with no major crashes and has a game loop which you  could replay if a person wanted to. I also want to put the source code  out there just for fun and maybe someone could learn something from it.\r\n </p>\n<p>Personal Game Jam Restrictions:\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>4 Days\r\n</li><li>Single Art Asset :: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/rolling-ball-assets<br/></li></ul>\n<p>If the HTML5 version in the browser doesn't work just download the executable. That should work just fine on windows.
