In this 3D place, there are 45 unique level challenges for you. Plus, there are 9 retro-style music tracks in the game. You can press \"Esc\" or \"Q\" button for the menu in the game.<br/><br/>Mission is simple; stay cool and crash these bricks!<br/><br/><strong>Rules!</strong><br/><br/>There's a rule you need to pay attention to; don't drop the ball! You only have 3 lives in each level. Each brick you break will give you as many points as your remaining lives. If you have 1 lives, you get 1 point, capish? :)<br/><br/>In each level, the game gives you 3 lives again. If you lose all your lives, the game over.<br/><br/><strong>Thanks!</strong><br/><br/>- To my family (my wife and my son) for their support and help.<br/>- Jascha (@CreaPracticus /Twitter) and Anuman (@Anuman_mp3 /Twitter) for their musics and support.<br/>- And I want to thank you. You are here and reviewing my first game. Maybe you will play, maybe you will pass, but here you are. Thank you too for your moral support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T03:51:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/096e4e48f971d33daf712693c9e6cd54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["terazihan", "Unitive Gameworks"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Unitive Gameworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
