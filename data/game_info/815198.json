{"id": 815198, "slug": "language-lab", "name": "Language Lab", "name_original": "Language Lab", "description": "(VR Required) Disclaimer: This is not your standard language learning app. It\u2019s the CrossFit of language learning apps. If you need to see grammar instructions and want multiple choice exercises to tell you how good you are, there are other apps for that. If you prefer to see an alphabet written on a blackboard in order to learn pronunciation, there are other apps for that.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe re-approached the language acquisition process from the ground up...literally, we thought about how humans naturally learn language as we are growing\u2026from the ground up\u2026(I guess that metaphor kind of works). We tried to create lessons that mimic the same learning process that we have all used while learning our first language as kids. This means the first thing you do is listen and watch what you are being told. Then you experiment with the objects in the lesson and try to figure out what you are being told to do. No reading, no multiple choice exercises, no grammar written out on blackboards, not in the beginning at least. We\u2019ve all done this before. We\u2019ve all learned a language like this before, our first language. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe built this because we were tired of spending years in classrooms, looking at alphabets and grammar written out in text books and hearing lectures from \u201cexperts\u201d with \u201cdecades of teaching experience\u201d before going to foreign countries and understanding next to nothing. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe built this because we wanted to understand. We wanted to communicate with people from other cultures with other languages. If this sounds like you too, come join the revolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur languages currently include: English, Spanish, Catalan, Arabic, Chinese, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Thai, Dutch, Swahili, and Persian.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T04:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816ae19367ea1d59b5916ab062481b8f.jpg", "website": "https://www.languagelabvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Language Lab VR"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Language Lab VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
