With no checkpoints in this single level maze, one touch of the lava will restart you all the way back at the beginning. Work through a variety of challenges that will test how well you can adapt to this unpredictable maze by using only a grappling hook and the ability to jump on wall panels. Experience the Worst Game Ever with normal default controls or make the game even worse with unconventional controls that will make every move a challenge. Adventure through this near-to-impossible maze to see what awaits you at the end.<br/><br/>Like mentioned above, the game consists of two game styles. Key difference between two modes is that in hardcore mode, controls are unconventional and simply uncomfortable; and it's nearly impossible to beat the level with. Although, some extra challenge is always good, despite the level itself being hard.<br/><br/><strong>So, what are you waiting?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca1/ca165f56932a4cd6886f0ccd76916019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sleepy Sheep"], "genres": ["Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sleepy Sheep"], "esrb_rating": null}
