Regardless of their plight, the two happy critters cheerily snapped the neck of their prison guard while he slept and prepared for another daring escape. This wasn't the first time they'd thwarted the King's efforts - and it certainly wouldn't be the last... <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t...Having said that though, these dungeons were unlike any hell-hole the King had cast the duo into previously. Every floor of the neon-walled catacombs was radically different in layout, and what were these odd pulsating crosses lining the corridor floors? Whatever they were for, they certainly tasted nice! And wasn't it convenient that after scoffing them all a key and exit would appear leading to another dungeon? Wizard!\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tGrabbing a crossbow each from a fallen troll, Getty and Emma skipped happily down the halls, filling their tummies with crosses and chirruping merrily as they let forth salvo after salvo of deadly bolts into the thick hides of their captors. Full of the spirit of adventure, the two friends felt super-positive about their chances - and even if they didn't make it out, nothing would stop them from having fun trying!\r\n\t</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDeveloped for the Commodore 64 home computer by Georg Rottensteiner, Sean Connolly and Ilija Melentijevi\u0107, <strong>GET EM DX</strong> is a one or two player (co-operative) maze-based arcade game. It's a bit like Pac-Man, but with procedurally generated levels and more shooting.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe goal on each level is to eat all the crosses, then grab the key that appears and head for the exit door. However, there's also a motley bunch of nasty characters who'll try their best to kill you, block your path and otherwise hinder your progress. In fact, they'll even run off with the exit key if you don't collect it first!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GET EM DX</strong> features:<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Endless, procedurally generated, super-hard arcade gameplay!</li>\n<li>8 different power-ups, 5 different enemy types and three difficulty levels!</li>\n<li>Single and multiplayer modes!</li>\n<li>Epic eight-bit cuteness squeezed into 16KB!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Playing <strong>GET EM DX</strong> on a Commodore 64 or PC</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe \r\n\tdigital version available here includes both the original 16KB cartridge ROM and an executable .PRG.
