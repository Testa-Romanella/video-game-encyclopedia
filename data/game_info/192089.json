Unfortunately, too many of us neglect our health, instead constantly seeking that next endorphin inducing mouth pleasure to make the shame go away - if only but momentarily.</p>\n<p>Gluttony Simulator lets you see in real time just how your choices to overeat can affect your mobility. Begin the game as a slim, fit, and attractive athlete, eat everything you see, and observe as your abilities to jump high and run fast quickly diminish. Also, eating makes you fat.</p>\n<p>This game was created for Ludum Dare 40.
