I always want to play with him table tennis and he usually says no because he is studying. And recently I told him to play a game, \"Breand and Fred\", but he didn't want and after that he was on holidays with friends in other country. I did this game about it, and there is \"Fideos\" and \"Escarvadientes\" because I\u00a0always hide that kind of things in his own objects, like in his bed or laptop. The fight system is not the best, I didn't want to spend to much time in this joke, but I\u00a0think that is well.</p>\n\n<p>You can skip the cinematic of playing table tennis when you are beatten by the boss with the right arrow.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and have a good day! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T10:48:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b0e8fe610e92be4307a5dc384b6da06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CoolFede97"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
