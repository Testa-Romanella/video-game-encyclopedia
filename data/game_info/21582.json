For reasons unknown, Bob must work the quarry to pay off his debts. Collect dirt, diamonds and other valuables but avoid causing the rocks to fall on to your head or to block the path back up. You\u2019ll question your sanity as you dive deeper into the quarry, hoping to return with a larger reward and praying you will not be killed at the hands of a falling rock or the creatures dwelling within. Die, as you surely will, and a new quarry is generated, with a new trove of treasures and dangers.Features<br/><strong>A Procedural death trap is a happy death trap:</strong> <br/>A new and unique quarry awaits you every time.<br/><br/><strong>Daily Quarry: </strong><br/>Each day a new standardised quarry will open up.
