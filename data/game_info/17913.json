It is the direct continuation of Batman: Arkham Origins and is a canon installment of the Batman: Arkham series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Three months after his first encounter with Joker, Bruce Wayne comes across the Catwoman who stole documents from a secret government organization. She is put in the Blackgate prison with the help of Batman. Two weeks later, the prisoners attempt an escape. The prison&#39;s staff is taken hostage, and the security detail is dead. Catwoman agrees to help Batman save the hostages.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike the Arkham game series, Blackgate is a 2.5-dimensional game, like Metroid and Castlevania. However, the game does not use any features of such dimension and plays out like a usual 2D title. </p>\n<p>The Protagonist walks from right to left clearing the prison out, saving the staff, and completing side-quests like finding items. Items can be detected using Batman&#39;s Detective Vision. </p>\n<p>When Batman walks into a new area of the prison, there a chance of encountering a group of prisoners, which will attack him. All the enemies, apart from bosses, require two or three hits to be knocked out. Most of the game&#39;s fights can be avoided by using stealth. When the player clears a certain area of the prison out, it will remain clear of enemies until the end of the game.</p>", "metacritic": 61, "released": "2014-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec5/ec54cd6582e512aca5ebc248316a26b9.jpg", "website": "http://www.batmanarkhamorigins.com", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 83, "owned": 1225, "beaten": 77, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 40, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 81, "ratings_count": 133, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 133, "platforms": ["Wii U", "Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Armature Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Warner Bros.
