But will it be better that other games? Well, probably not. But that's not important.

I liked the idea and this concept didn't seem very hard to program. But I still enjoy playing it. I even added Freeroam mode! (Btw. the portals in freeroam mode look like they're turned off, but the work.)</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading (and maybe playing my game).</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<ul><li>W/Up - acceleration</li><li>A/Left - left</li><li>D/Right - right</li><li>Spacebar - restart level</li><li>Esc - quit the game</li></ul>\n<p>(Due to the nature of Godot Engine, there may be another controls as well [on the gamepad for example]).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:54:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc58bc5c432860e0d95e941f1ceeb23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Voivy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
