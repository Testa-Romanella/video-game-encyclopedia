This was released on Kongregate and it flopped hard. But I loved the idea and enjoyed making the graphics. Also all proper AS3 OOP! More or less.</p>\n<p>level 2 is a bit of a sticky wicket, but the rest are solid enough (If I remember correctly - was just playing it and can't beat level 2...) It is a little buggy, but hey it's a free game.<br/><br/>Oh, and the music is a bit obnoxious. you might want to hit that mute button before long.
