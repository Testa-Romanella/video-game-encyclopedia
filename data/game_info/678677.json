An entire empire bears down on us. Enter the rifts to discover lost cities, enchanted forests, foreboding mines and dungeons deep. Venture forth alone or with a party. Discover ancient magic and mythical weapons to empower you. Restore the Stolen Realm.<h3>\u00a0</h3><br/><h3>Who will you be?</h3>The classic wizard, thief or fighter?  Or will you break the mold to forge a champion all your own? A spell slinging assassin, a priest born of frost or a shadow infused knight. There is no limit to what you can create with multiple systems and flexible customization. Choose to go all in on one of 8 skill trees or mix and match to your hearts content.<h3>What will you wield?</h3>Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you? The Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood?  Earn and reforge loot that truly changes the way you play.<h3>\u00a0</h3><br/><h3>How will you conquer?</h3>By splitting your opponents with a well placed ice wall? By sneaking through unsuspecting crowds to deliver the fatal backstab? By raining arrows on your foes as you take the Shrine of the Conqueror to devastating effect? Defeat your opponents in satisfying, tactical, turn-based combat. Enjoy tactical strategy where every step matters.<h3>Who will help you?</h3>A carefully crafted team under you control? Your friends through 6 player online co-op? Or will you be a lone wolf with only a trusty blade at your side. Immerse yourself in a world that scales well for a full party or a single character.<h3>\u00a0</h3><br/><h3>What will you discover?</h3>Frosty peaks guarded by the elusive Blue Dragon? Overgrown jungle where the rock giants roam? Deep dungeons where the undead rise. Explore a world that changes on each expedition. Outsmart clever enemies.<h3>\u00a0</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T16:53:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/096b4632daf14cda7d364e5965b8e8d3.jpg", "website": "https://burst2flame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 45, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 487, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Burst2Flame Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Burst2Flame Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
