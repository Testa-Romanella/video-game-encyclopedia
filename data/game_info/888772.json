Although there was one person who stuck out among the rest. The 27th person was the only single person in the town; his name was Peter Dan. He knew something was missing in his life. One day he was walking down the street and saw a bright light coming from a manhole cover. Naturally he went towards it and made sure no one was around to see him. He pulled it aside and a sign popped up next to him reading in old print \u201cThe chance of a lifetime awaits\u201d. Without hesitation Peter jumped in to begin his unknown quest. When he woke up he was in what seemed to be an alternate universe. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/639/6393deb917b8f01e81d8362e15c85822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jacklockerbie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
