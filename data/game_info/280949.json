I kind of lost control, wanting to make choices and multiple endings. It's not too bad I hope, but maybe this was too ambitious of a project to begin with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think I'll make other Visual Novels, this is an interesting medium, and I'm deeply interested in interactions in narration.</p>\n<p>This game might be buggy, please forgive me, I'm not a developper and even a simplified language such as Ren'Py's isn't comfortable to me. As this is not a major project to me, I'd prefer to leave it as it is and probably won't correct any bug or anything.</p>\n<p>Yet it's been an interesting experience, and I hope you'll enjoy this game and forgive its narrative, visual, and dev mistakes.<br/><br/>English is not my birth language. There will probably be mistakes. I am sorry in advance.</p>\n<p>/!\\ CAUTION /!\\<br/>There are some flashing lights. If you are subject to epilepsy, maybe playing this game is not recommended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007f0959abacc6acf89c14164f474476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Adebreg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
