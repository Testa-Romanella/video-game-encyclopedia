It's a short adventure with an interesting and mysterious story and setting. I will probably make a sequel to the game sometime (with a different art style and different puzzle mechanics. It will also probably have a little bit of combat).</p>\n<p>If you find any gamebreaking bugs, let me know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T06:08:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/770f5fdfcef5743e9b85bd26828ab41a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Perion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
