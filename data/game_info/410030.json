The concept of the game is pretty simple, just look around the map for key items and switchs so you can progress and fight the bosses.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Everything on the game was made from scratch by 2 persons\u00a0\u00a0since the start of the JAM.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You have 2 executables, and of them is just a upscaled version of the game, which you can see everything in 2x. We recommend playing the upscaled version, since it's easier to read dialogues and to see everything that is going on screen.</p>\n<p>Commands:</p>\n<p>X - Attack</p>\n<p>C - Roll</p>\n<p>Arrows - Movement</p>\n<p>Esc - Exit Game</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:53:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee6/ee6edffaa546a9dd3a5aa900c1163360.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["legiaoru"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
