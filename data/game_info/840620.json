Mostly hand-drawn &amp; animated by me, with the exception of the elements credited below.\r\n</li><li>New music &amp;\u00a0sound effects to reflect the aesthetic change of the game (isn't significant because I\u00a0did not make or record most audio myself, except for the player shooting sound effect).\r\n</li><li>Changed levels to create progression in the game.\r\n</li><li>Created a \"hearts\" script that references the \"health\" script to show the player's current lives in the GUI.\r\n</li><li>Added an instructions screen that shows the game's controls.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p><strong>NEW Modifications:</strong></p>\n<ol><li><strong>Slime enemy SFX, recorded &amp;\u00a0edited by yours truly :)</strong></li><li><strong>Original 8-bit lose jingle!</strong></li><li><strong>Original 8-bit win jingle!</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Undeveloped features shown:\r\n</p>\n<p><em>I\u00a0included these because I\u00a0liked these ideas but didn't know how to execute them, but\u00a0I'm likely to come back after the class is over to keep working on this game!</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Sound toggle button. It toggles visually, but it doesn't alter the game sound in any way.\r\n</li><li>Star system. I liked the idea of showing the player on the \"level cleared\"\u00a0page how well they completed the level, but I'm not experienced enough in C# to do this yet.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The information button on the pause &amp;\u00a0game over screens is not directly tied to an info page. I\u00a0wanted to figure out how to have the \"back\" button from my Main Menu's info page return back to the previous page (e.g. pause or game over), but I\u00a0wasn't sure how to do this.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Asset Credit:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Freehand PS Brushes, by\u00a0Skyline Illusions\r\n</li><li>Doodly TrueType, by RZDESIGN\r\n</li><li>Doodic, by wowomnom\r\n</li><li>SA Yesenin Realistic Scribbles Font, by mankoff\r\n</li><li>\"Retro Funk\" by TexasBrother\r\n</li><li>\"Funky Guitar Loop\"\u00a0by TexasBrother\r\n</li><li>Doodle UI Pack, by Vladimir Kovtunovskiy\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>YO DECLAN:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What's up?\u00a0Just here to r</strong><strong>emind you to grade this based on the Windows version, not the WebGL version as discussed last semester (there's something weird with the cursor you said you'd rather not deal with)\u00a0<em>AND\u00a0</em>let you know that I\u00a0used the same screenshots from my last iteration of this game, as no visual elements were changed.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T16:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10df97c8b9adf6601c4230355cceb839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nonabeans"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
