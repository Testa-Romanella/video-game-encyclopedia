{"id": 483395, "slug": "super-squado", "name": "Super Squado", "name_original": "Super Squado", "description": "<p>Race from platform to platform in this infinite procedurally generated world, using Squado's super powers. Use A, D, and Space to move. For whatever reason, itch.io expands the game when its not fullscreen, so to see it properly, please click the BLUE fullscreen button, NOT the clear itch.io fullscreen button. Squado's first super power is the ability to reverse time back to his last jump (REDO Theme)\u00a0using E, but be careful, if he is falling too fast, he will not be able to resist the momentum and might fall short of the platform. The bar on the left shows you how much recharge you have. Squado's second super power is to teleport to a nearby platform that is within your reach (Out of Reach). The reach is displayed by the red circle around Squado.
