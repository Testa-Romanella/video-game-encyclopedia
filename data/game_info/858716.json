Other entries already have explored \"the end\" as being the end of the world, the right side of a level, or the end of a puzzle that reverses back.</p>\n<p>With our entry, we had a firm idea that to have an end there needs to be a beginning. In some cases, you can hide the beginning and imply that you are at the end- however, in our case we decided to show the player where it starts (And so, technically, you start the\u00a0<em>game</em> at the beginning). That said, not much time passes before you reach the end of the land given. After some exploring, you'll find yourself needing to go back in the stage for some reason or another and that is how we pulled of \"start at the end\".</p>\r\nThe Process\r\nPrototyping\r\n<p>This stage was weird... A lot of changing things very fast and having a very hazy view of where the project was going to end up. This lead to us discovering that Coffee does not communicate his thoughts enough, resulting in everyone being on a totally different page when it came to the vision of the project! We eventually figured things out and everything suddenly made sense, became cohesive, and development really began.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, though, the game was not about buying tiles and expanding the level. The game was about going to the other end of the level and starting over with slight alterations each time. This was very repetitive and we quickly moved on from that!</p>\r\nModelling\r\n<p>For the most part the models were made on the fly as they were needed and polished from the beginning. Typically, a model would go through iterations and eventually find itself replacing old art- not in this game! No time for such clarity!</p>\n<p>Some models were more complicated than others and required the welcome aid of concept art. Griffin Phillis helped immensely in that department!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Modelling the player character and creatures was by far the most fun for Coffee;\u00a0</p>\r\n\"I honestly had no idea I could model creatures at all until Griffin Phillis pushed me along with the astounding concept art and redlining he did (He drew red lines around screenshots of my models to help me with shapes!\".<br/>\n<p>Griffin spent many hours studying bug anatomy on his streams during this project and it really put it to work on the pieces that were produced. Although all of his work did not make it to the game in the end, we have plans to add them post-jam!</p>\r\nMusic<p>At first it was basically impossible to decide what the music should sound like, since there was no definitive theme for the game. As the ideas for the game\u00a0became more solidified, it allowed the music to start being\u00a0developed. And knowing that the player character was a lizard was very\u00a0helpful for deciding what instruments to use.\u00a0</p>\r\nSound Design<p>The sounds in the game\u00a0were a mix of recordings of things in Vigilabo's house and synthesized sounds in FL Studio.\u00a0</p>\"I filled a big plastic box with water and spent 3 hours recording water splashing sounds.\"<p>Vigilabo also decided to have Griffin do the voice sounds for the player character, he can make some funny noises.</p>\r\nThe Team\r\nCoffee\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Gameplay logic</li><li>3D Art</li><li>Shader programming and technical art</li></ul>\r\nI've had my fair share of experience with gameplay logic, shaders, and 3D art so I was happy to test my abilities with this game jam. I'm really happy with what we managed to produce! This game features my favourite character model I've ever done (The Lizard).\r\nVigilabo\r\n<ul><li>Sound Design</li><li>Music</li><li>Interactable polish</li></ul>\r\nI've been playing piano and making music for a while (smacking the keys\u00a0that make funny sounds). This is my first time doing music for a standalone game. I've also been getting more into sound design, which is pretty fun. It was quite the challenge to make all the sounds for this game within the timespan.\u00a0woof\ud83d\udc9c (I put a heart at the end of mine\u00a0too because Griffy put one)\r\nGriffin Phillis\r\n<ul><li>Concept art</li><li>Refining 3D models with redlining</li></ul>\n<em>I've been an artist all of my life, and for the past couple of years, I've wanted to get into game-making as well! This is the first of which I've helped bring to fruition with my creative mind and workflow; As the concept artist, I'd designed the lizard player-character as well as the turtle and the enemy ladybugs. \ud83d\udc9a</em>\r\nThe Future\r\n<p>We have not yet decided if we will pursue this project to it's full potential, but the likelihood of us abandoning it right away is very low!\u00a0We have plans to make this rogue-lite game much more engaging and fantastical. We recognise that the game's concept is very different from most other rogue-likes and want to explore that- scouting for potential, if you will!</p>\n<p>If we do pursue it, we expect many changes will come to the game. For one, we have already begun discussion on augmenting the main level into more of a survival style game, fitting rogue-like elements into dungeons that you may explore as you encounter them.</p>\n<p>We have another project going on currently and will have to weigh the potential benefit of shifting focus for a while.
