I had recently found a \"minimally interactive\" web-game where you just set a character free and let it fend for itself.<br/></p>\n<p>I found the mechanism amusing, so I decided to make a few of my own. I made a nice wide range of themes and skill levels (Insect Invasion is easiest, Robot Uprising is hardest). They took up minimal space on your phone. I even made ad-supported versions if you didn't want to pay for them.\r\n</p>\n<p>My plan was for them to be little time-wasters while things are happening elsewhere in your life -- you could be on a phone call while escaping the zombie hordes or destroying the\u00a0martian space chickens.</p>\n<p>The games are\u00a0a fidget spinner with a plot!</p>\n<p>And. . .the games totally flopped. It seemed like maybe the mechanism was a bit too simplistic. Or players didn't get the whole zen of the game. Or they just looked cheap. Or they didn't have licensed characters. Or any combination of those factors.\r\n</p>\n<p>On top of that, Google and Apple were continually taking them down for annoying little problems. First they didn't like that the high resolution icons were intentionally pixel-ly. Then the One Tap Zombie icon was too violent. Then Robot Uprising was too scary for kids.\r\n</p>\n<p>It just got to be too much --\u00a0I'd spend a day or two making requested changes and updating all the app-stores just to have the games make no money.\r\n</p>\n<p>So here they are. Download 'em and have fun. If you like 'em and want to support me, buy them for $1.25. That's a quarter a game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T13:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28dc216668f8f64778febdd4d5b5c474.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
