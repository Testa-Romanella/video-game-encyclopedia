Such kingdom was ruled by a king and a queen. People say the rulers had magical powers that prevented creatures and wild beasts invading the kingdom, which is protected by a stone wall. Their inhabitants lived their happily lives, but outside the walls it was impossible for them to survive.</em></p>\n<p><em>A long time ago a white dragon tried to invade the kingdom but several fire elementals summoned by the king stopped her. Since then the dragon has never attacked again but she swore revenge.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Nova is the latest heiress to the royal throne.
