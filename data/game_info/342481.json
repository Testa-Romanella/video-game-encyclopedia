{"id": 342481, "slug": "rat-a-sewey", "name": "Rat-a-Sewey", "name_original": "Rat-a-Sewey", "description": "<p>Play as Charlie the rat, running around\u00a0his sewer home, catching food as it drops through the grate above. Beware! Sometimes the food will be rotting, and sometimes poison pellets get dropped down instead that you'll have to jump to avoid!</p>\n<p>You'll also need to watch out for Lou. (Someone mentioned once that he got flushed down a loo, and he liked the word!) After the first couple levels, this hungry alligator\u00a0occasionally swims by looking for a tasty little rat snack.</p>\n<p>Rat-a-Sewey is a 2D, short play session, casual game - fun, silly,\u00a0\u00a0and just a bit\u00a0addictive!\u00a0It starts out slow and the speed ramps up over time. It keeps track of your high scores so you can try to beat them!</p>\n<p>At this time, it is Windows only (tested in Windows 10 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit), and opens in a standalone player. You can choose the resolution and choose between windowed and fullscreen.</p>\n<p>The controls are very simple - move left and right using either the <strong>arrows</strong>, or the <strong>A and D keys</strong>. Jump using the <strong>Spacebar</strong>. Pause with the <strong>Escape key</strong>. You can also control the music and SFX volumes in the menu.</p>\n<p>This is officially our first game! (So please be gentle - but we welcome critique!) We - that is, my husband and I - are\u00a0Red Nebula Studios,\u00a0and this game was completed as a self-imposed \"make a game from start to finish in 1 month\" challenge. Sort of a personal game jam, I suppose! It was made in Unity and completed between June 14th and July 14th, 2019. I did the artwork and programming, and my husband did the music.<br/></p>\n<p>I have also documented the game dev process over on my YouTube channel, Ms.RedNebula. Please feel free to take a look if you'd like to see how this project came together!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T06:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/688a1cb2626f3231c202d97ba28bf8f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ms.RedNebula"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
