Game is in development and there are only 7 achievements, 7 enemies &amp; 30 lvls.<br/>This is my first game so do not judge strictly. (Seriously, I'm only 14 years old!) I know that this game\u00a0can be weird sometimes.</p>\n\n\n<p>There is also customization screen. Make your character unique!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>A &amp; D - Move</li><li>W - Jump (hold to jump higher)</li><li>S - Stomp (press in jump) (Stomp 'em all. :D)</li><li>Shift+A/D - Dash</li><li>LMB - shoot (hold it down)</li><li>RMB - throw a grenade. (It bounces. A lot.)</li><li>You also can wall jump and double jump.</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits ( all is CC0 ):\r\n0x72 (https://0x72.itch.io/) - base for characters and all hair/hats are made by him.\r\njuhani.junkala@musician.org - all music in this game was made by him.\r\n\n<p>If anyone liked this game, I can continue to develop it. I also want to make multiplayer mode. That should be fun.<br/></p>\n<p>I think that\u2019s all. Thanks for viewing!
