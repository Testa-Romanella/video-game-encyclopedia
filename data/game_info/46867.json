Oh yes you'll probably die a lot but that's why you can team-up to 4 players on couch coop or through Internet. Pick a character from the cute tiny kitten to the walking fish and face off the challenges of the 10 consecutive levels. Each one is procedurally generated just like the weapons and the enemies, offering billions of possibilities: no game looks like another, enough to play countless of hours with friends cooperating to kill enemies, solve puzzles and shoot at each others. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHeld captive in the impossible mansion of the scientist you'll face off 3 different environments and dozen of differents enemies before fighting the final boss. Change the way you approach the game and upgrade your character along your progression with perks of reload speed, more generous ammo\u2019s loot, life steal...<br/>\r\n2, 3 or even 4 players can play together or against in the differents game modes. Difficulty scales itself offering a more intense experience if there is several players: more enemies, more guns but also new and exclusives multiplayer rooms added to the levels but sometimes the challenge comes more from dealing with your insane teammates than your enemies.<br/>\r\nGenetic Disaster is all about the die, laugh and retry principle.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-16T15:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c60b7cf275215544e5e98fc2540a914.jpg", "website": "http://team8studio.com/index.php/fr/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 50, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Team8 Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Drageus Games", "Team8 Studio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
