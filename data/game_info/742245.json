Some of the stones in the ruins are still standing which provide clues to the puzzle.\u00a0 It sounds simple, but the trick is that words must make sense both vertically and horizontally!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I developed it with mobile in mind. I gave it a bright and fun theme which is typical in casual mobile games.</p>\n<p>This is my entry for the GDevelop game jam. This was my first time using the GDevelop engine and I thoroughly enjoyed learning it. I was actually surprised how easy it is to prototype a game in the engine and end up with something with a bit of quality to it. I'll definitely be using it again in the future!.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Stone touch sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/F.M.Audio/sounds/570531/</p>\n<p>Locked Sound:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/JPolito/sounds/391724/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T06:26:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b5/5b590183fadaad979a7aee80f72cd19b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeeBeeGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
