Thanks to https://ambientcg.com\u00a0for the free high quality textures! Anyways, as i said the game is not that good. In the game there are 8 levels in wich you have to find a randoly placed object (Reeses Cup) but the game isn't that easy. There is a snail chasing after you! You might ask what does this have to do with the theme ''bug''? Well the player is in fact a bug. Yea. Anyway this game has no story BUT at the end will\u00a0 be a cutscene with a HUGE plot twst. Play though it to see!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:51:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83f072b536fb9b74ef355e8ce5b3775b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CraZyPiT"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
