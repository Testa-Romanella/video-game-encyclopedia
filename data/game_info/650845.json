Players take turns to switch control sides and can only move one square diagonally forward. When the chess piece moves, and there is an enemy in front of it but there is no chess piece further away, the enemy chess piece can be captured and crossed. If you encounter an enemy piece that can be passed after eating, you can skip and eat the enemy piece continuously, that is, eat continuously. If there is a chance to eat continuously, you must eat continuously. When a chess piece enters the deepest part of the enemy's camp, it will evolve into a king. The king can move one square diagonally behind, and the number of kings is not limited.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInstructions:<br/>\r\nMenu button on the left handle to call out the menu;<br/>\r\nThe left handle can interact with the menu, the trigger button is determined, and the trigger button can also control the movement of the chess pieces.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T13:58:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d7/8d7e2b8439c1241a56df895ee1feccb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VR RETRO REMASTER"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["VR RETRO REMASTER"], "esrb_rating": null}
