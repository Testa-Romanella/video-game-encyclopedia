Play hide-and-seek in a happy courtyard at nighttime with your friends, find them all with your flashlight before they reach the burrow! Remember, if even one hider reaches the burrow you will lose the level. <br/></p>\n<p>However, playing hide-and-seek at night can make you feel lonely, and frustrated...<br/></p>\r\nAI\r\n<p>The intelligence controlling the hiders is a Neural Network\u00a0trained using\u00a0Deep Reinforcement Learning. The agents\u00a0have learned how to play the game by themselves through trial-and-error and there is <em>no scripted behavior</em>. However, during training we ensured that they were trained to always be\u00a0<em>beatable</em> and <em>fun</em>. Try to beat a Machine Learning based game AI, leave feedback, and have fun!<br/></p>\r\nCommands\r\n<p>All commands are available on the screen. You can move in all 8 directions and turn your flashlight left and right\u00a0to find the hiders. When your flashlight battery runs out,\u00a0you lose the game. Every time you find a hider or lose a game, the red bar will increase. But what happens when it reaches its maximum?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T11:43:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3c/f3cbe532c5c55ee9e08739589f70f757.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sesto92", "marcomistretta", "Ganjiro", "feubar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
