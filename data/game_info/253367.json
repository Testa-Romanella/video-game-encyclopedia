Remember what you have learnt about surviving a zombie disaster and guide your people in this post-apocalyptic adventure.<br/><br/>The world as we know it no longer exists; now it is time to create a new one. It won\u2019t be easy! The zombies are a true plague. They\u2019re not very smart, but they\u2019re everywhere, and they are legion.<br/><br/>Build your own shelter and make it safe. Find survivors and convince them to join you. Together you will be able to improve the shelter and create a new home. Those will be the first steps towards building a new civilization, a new zombie-free world for humans.<br/><br/>But the road to survival is filled with danger. There are no governments, no authorities: anarchy reigns over the world. Survival not only depends on staying away from the zombies, you must also defend your shelter from bandits and thieves. Other survivors have built shelters too, and they see you as a threat. In this post-apocalyptic world, every new settlement that is discovered is considered a threat and treated like a dangerous enemy. Trust is no longer the order of the day \u2013 it is an exception.<br/><br/>DEFEAT THE PLAGUE<br/>Lead your squad against the zombie hordes and defeat the undead. Attack their gathering points and collect resources to help your people. Victory in the war against the undead lies in your hands.<br/><br/><br/>FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL<br/>Attack other settlements to survive. Study their defenses, prepare your team, and develop the right strategy to get inside other shelters to steal their resources.<br/><br/>DEFEND WHAT IS YOURS<br/>Train your team to defend your base and configure a defensive system to protect it from the zombies. But do not underestimate survivors! Humans from other settlements will try to plunder your shelter.<br/><br/>RECRUIT SURVIVORS<br/>Find isolated people, and together build a safe place to live, far from zombies and bandits. Assign them roles in the shelter and ask for their help while you leave to collect resources. Turn survivors into heroes in the war against zombies.<br/><br/>NEGOTIATE WITH OTHER SETTLEMENTS<br/>Everyone is an enemy, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way forever. Contact other refugees and create alliances with them. Building a new world is a tough proposition: you\u2019ll need to negotiate with other shelters to succeed.<br/><br/>BUILD THE BEST SHELTER<br/>The world has come to an end, but that doesn\u2019t mean survivors should live badly. Manage your shelter, improve it to make space for more survivors, add entertainment zones and farming areas. Grow crops, recycle materials, and establish a self-sufficient community.<br/><br/>TAKE THE SURVIVORS INTO THE REAL WORLD<br/><br/>Use the Augmented Reality feature to bring the survivors into the real world.
