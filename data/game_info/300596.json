We intended to create something similar to Puzzle Quest. However we made a little twist to the match 3 mechanism. Now you create matches by swapping a gray ball with other blocks on the board. You will soon find this is an inefficient way of making matches. To compensate this the cyclic swap is introduced. It move four blocks at once. Try to discover the patterns that enable faster matching.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T05:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2cd6ceedd95ba022563230776e61fde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["charlieqiu2017"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
