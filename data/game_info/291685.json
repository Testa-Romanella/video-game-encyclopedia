We came up with many game ideas that could demonstrate this theme but our group thought of food as the best method to showcase this. Food in Filipino culture is widely appreciated and it would be the easiest way to display this to a wide audience through our game.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-08T04:51:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/4506b85011e607bc60f7d1a4d1e19a88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LytonDoesGameJams"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
