Federal government agents seized the land with no explanation as to whether the hole was a dangerous threat or important to national security or both. Waters said the cover story the government gave was that it was the old site of a downed aircraft.\u00a0 [\u2026] Waters said the hole had paranormal properties, despite the fact locals dumped their garbage there for years. He said a rural resident tossed his dead dog into the hole only to see it later alive outdoors with a hunter. The dog wouldn\u2019t come to him.</em></p>\n<ul><li>MIKE JOHNSTON, GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF MEL\u2019S HOLE (https://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/getting-to-the-bottom-of-mels-hole/_</li></ul>\n<p><em>Holey space, or more accurately ()hole complex (connoting a degenerate wholeness), speeds up and triggers a particular subversion in solid bodies such as earth. It unfolds holes as ambiguous entities \u2013 oscillating between surface and depth \u2013 within solid matrices, fundamentally corrupting the latter\u2019s consolidation and wholeness through perforations and terminal porosities. For a solid body, the vermiculation of holes undermines the coherency between the circumferential surfaces and its solidity. The process of degenerating a solid body by corrupting the coherency of its surface is called ungrounding. In other words, the process of ungrounding degenerates the whole into an endless hollow body \u2013 irreducible to nothingness \u2013 and damages the coherency between the surfaces and the solid body itself.\r\n  </em></p>\n<ul><li>REZA NEGARESTANI, CYCLONOPEDIA: COMPLICITY WITH ANONYMOUS MATERIALS\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Everything by Death Orgone except:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sound files</strong></p>\n<p>Fan.wav by adrilahan (https://freesound.org/people/adrilahan/sounds/249738/)<br/>Flies on S*** by TeTeNoise (https://freesound.org/people/TeTeNoise/sounds/519404/)<br/>Glass Broken by Zeinel (https://freesound.org/people/Zeinel/sounds/483363/)<br/>Headshot 2 by SilverIllusionist (https://freesound.org/people/SilverIllusionist/sounds/470586/)<br/>Mechanical Keyboard Typing by GeorgeHopkins (https://freesound.org/people/GeorgeHopkins/sounds/537244/)</p>\n<p><strong>Textures</strong></p>\n<p>Concrete Floor 16\u00a0https://www.3dxo.com/textures/5599_concrete_floor_16<br/>Floor thread pattern\u00a0https://www.3dxo.com/textures/10518_floor_tread_pattern<br/>Rust http://texturer.com/set4442/\u00a0and\u00a0http://texturer.com/set2168/|<br/>Veins\u00a0https://3dtextures.me/2020/10/26/veins-001/</p>\n<p><strong>Free tools</strong></p>\n<p>Glitch Pixel Brushes by Dataerase (https://dataerase.itch.io/)<br/>Bezier Path Creator by Sebastian Lague (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082)<br/>Visions of Chaos (https://softology.com.au)<br/><br/><strong>Other inspirations</strong></p>\n<p>Lucia Dovicakova<br/>Junji Ito's The Enigma of Amigara Fault</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20764a661a2a7afc3d9538dce46fa302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Death Orgone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
