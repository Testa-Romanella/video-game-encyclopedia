Some of the minigames\u00a0are a bit weird. Most of them don't even have music. They're mostly pretty simple. There isn't much more to say really.</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>Copy-pasted from the intro sequence:</p>\n<p>You've been putting up with the abysmal speeds of Bombcrest's internet service for too long. It's long overdue that you got a new provider.<br/>PB &amp; J General Need Internet has been sounding pretty good.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Bombcrest's internet service has an... unusual clause.<br/>You missed it while signing up, so you're learning this one the hard way.<br/>Long story short, they're allowed to do anything to your computer to try to stop you.</p>\n<p>And they're currently putting that clause into effect.<br/>Can you get past all their countermeasures and change internet services?<br/>Or will you forever be stuck with the awful service that is Bombcrest?</p>\n<p>In either case, you'd better disable these countermeasures...<br/>They're kind of getting in the way of you using your computer.<br/>And seeing as how your job is as a programmer... well, you'd better get this over with fast!</p>\r\nSide note:\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!
