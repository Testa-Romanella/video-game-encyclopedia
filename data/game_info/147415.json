Made for the <strong>GameBoy Jam 2015.</strong></p>Controls<p><strong>WASD </strong>- Move<br/><strong>K - </strong>Shoot<br/><strong>J</strong> - Check<br/><strong>Space - </strong>Menu<br/><em>Might support xbox360 controller</em></p>NotesThe game is short, and unpolished. I can see some potential in it, and might get back to it someday. This was done very quickly, in about a week or so, and I was pretty much done with it after the gbjam4 ended.<p>The menu has some options that do nothing. I wanted to implement more RPG elements and an Inventory system where you could gather items and keys, but I run out of time! :-/<br/></p>Is it too hard?<p>Probably as I didn't playtest it much. What do you think?</p><p>Contact me on twitter @jondmt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1aa15e1aa0dfee5c19c5dad94404e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["johndimi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
