This was the first game jam where\u00a0I collaborated with my then-girlfriend/now-fianc\u00e9e Eden, who designed the unique corgi personalities to rescue.</p>\n<p>This short work was created in one weekend for Ludum Dare #38 Game Jam.\u00a0The theme for the jam was \"Small Worlds\". We tried to make a platformer on a spherical world, which ended up being very difficult, from a physics perspective. Tank-style controls were a compromise to make the game playable in time for the jam submission deadline, so sorry about that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-26T05:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/8639e980ecbbdda5b4a1dc58ef13eb77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nick Ver Voort"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
