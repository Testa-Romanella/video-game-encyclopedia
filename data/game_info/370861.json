{"id": 370861, "slug": "reincarnation-tutorial", "name": "Reincarnation Tutorial", "name_original": "Reincarnation Tutorial", "description": "<p>This game was made for the Community Game Jam (August 2019) by Regina Kuznetsova (Art). Denis Kotenko (Sound FX. Music Mixing, Audio Component Coding). and Pavel Sergaziev (well... literally everything else - Concept. Coding. Level Design. Narration. Music, etc.).</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam - AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - 'The game is a liar'. Which means it's not what it looks like at first glance (or maybe even at first playthrough). Think. Look (and listen) for the clues. and you will prevail. Definitely. Well, I'm sure of it.\u00a0 - Pavel</p>\n<p>The game is designed to be played in 1920 x 1080p. Camera size sets itself according to your screen resolution, in order to minimize 2D sprite glitches by making pixels in game\u00a0sprites fit pixels on your screen. But it has a side effect - the less your resolution is, the less of the game area you will see... Huh, I wonder, how it looks in 4K...</p>\n<p>Also the game has a narrated tutorial - you probably won't be able to play without sound. Sorry for the accent and possible mistakes - English is not my native language.</p><p>Known bugs:</p><p>- Game start Checkpoint is a bit off.</p><p>-\u00a0 Camera movement is too slow, so when the character is falling down, sometimes you can't see if and where he's going to land.</p><p>- Narrator goes on talking when he probably should not.</p><p>I'll upload the fixes once the jam ranking period is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6de/6de2b9ff3def3f877ee23dbd96b0c09b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daromaru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
