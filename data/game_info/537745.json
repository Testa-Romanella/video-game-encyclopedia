Those times were dark and terrifying and so is the game.</p>\n<p>You start in a civil defense shelter deep under a Prague Metro station. As a proud holder of the military readiness badge you know what your duty is: put on a non-functioning gas mask, load the vz. 52 pistol and protect the peace and your socialist homeland from the strange intruders*.</p>\n<p>The classic gameplay and vibe of romeric shooters from 1990s including a fitting brown retro aesthetic.</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll find a shotgun, a vz. 13 SMG, a rocket launcher and even some secret experimental Soviet battery-powered weapons (e.g. a ball lightning launcher). If you run out of ammo, you might find the hammer and sickle coming in handy.</p>\n<p>Handcrafted levels inspired by real locations with an emphasis on historical details. Every level contains socialist paraphernalia which nowadays can only be found in museums or your grandma&#39;s attic**.</p>\n<p>Flushable toilets and destructible light bulbs.</p>\n<p>A custom engine written in Pascal imitating 1990s software-style rendering with unfiltered textures and polygon jitter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Madmen in raincoats, killers in protective suits, autonomously attacking dogs, horses and goats<br />\n** Eastern Bloc only</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T04:32:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/3d1/3d1a7326f4c73b76008fa51c3976e7ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.81, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 274, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 28, "dropped": 10, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 57, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spytihn\u011bv"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spytihn\u011bv"], "esrb_rating": null}
