Towers can swap places at any time, and towers deal bonus damage to enemies that share their color. You'll need to make split-second, under-the-gun decisions to maneuver your towers against waves of ever more dangerous enemies over six levels. Each color of tower provides not only a special power to its own projectiles, but also to its adjacent neighbors. Experiment with different arrangements to customize your defense.</p>\n<p>This game was a blast to make, and allowed me to test mechanics for an upcoming game. I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left Click: Place /\u00a0Upgrade Towers</p>\n<p>Right Click: Swap Towers</p>\n<p>1-6: Select Tower Color</p>\n<p>Esc/Space: Pause</p>\n<p>Instructions available in-game.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>RGB Defense is\u00a0<em>difficult</em>. If you get stuck, here's some general strategy tips:</p>\n<p>Towers don't deal much damage unless they're shooting a same colored enemy. Try to maneuver your towers such that they're always shooting the right thing.</p>\n<p>Resources are scarce in the early game. Wait to see what enemies are coming before spending money.</p>\n<p>Towers gain a temporary damage boost after being swapped. Whenever you have a free moment, swap towers back and forth to improve your damage output.</p>\n<p>Spam click on annoying enemies. It doesn't do anything, but might make you feel better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:42:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/325b2f7cbcd604cd76f53722c3e9461b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["corriveaugames"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
