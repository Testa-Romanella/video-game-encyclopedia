The resulting mental tranquility will allow you to go deeper and deeper to a calmed state.<br/></p>\r\nGamplay\r\n<p><strong>Best to Play in 1920x1080 Full Screen on Itch.io</strong>\u00a0- I can\u2019t guarantee how well it will work in other resolutions (building UI is new for me)\r\n</p>\n<p>Take a look at the instructions screen within the game, but essentially you move the brain character around and push the colored emotions into their corresponding \u2018goals\u2019 on the ring. There are 10 balls in the first level total, spawning every 2.5 seconds, so the lowest possible score would be ~25 seconds.\r\n</p>\n<p>The Brain doesn\u2019t get hurt, so you can use the 4 sides to act like a pong paddle. You can Left-Click to blast the balls that are in the little zone in front of the player.\u00a0<strong>The Mouse Wheel turns the Character</strong>\u00a0(forgot to mention in the in-game Instructions)\r\n</p>\r\nThoughts\r\n<p>My first Compo (I\u2019ve done a few Jams), and complete solo. As always I found myself spending far too much time learning tools (i.e. GIMP) and debugging the nuances of Unity (i.e. Looking at your WebGL builds that don\u2019t play nice). That said, I enjoyed using GIMP to make my own Art Assets Making my own sound effects was silly, and satisfying, and if I had a bit more time I would have improved the quality. Building UI is just, well atrocious. I feel like UI s is somewhere where I could improve a lot.\r\n</p>\r\nTODO/Bugs\r\n<p>Add instruction about Mouse Wheel to Instructions Figure out how to customize UI for different screen sizes Better demonstrate that Ball/Emotion launcher has a \u2018hopper\u2019 with ball colors Create additional levels (perhaps with environmental barriers, more balls, faster balls, more frequent spawns) Improve Audio (sound effects are a bit delayed) Clean up the horrendous code. Started off fairly clean and decoupled, descended into madness by the end. Source Code on Github doesn\u2019t have the Audio Files (since there were 10mb+)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:46:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/46902f583397e9ad541838925c18b869.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quoclon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
