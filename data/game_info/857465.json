{"id": 857465, "slug": "kuko-kuko", "name": "Kuko Kuko", "name_original": "Kuko Kuko", "description": "<p>Cutesy little Flash breakout game published 15 years ago. 30 levels set above the sky. Zip includes a standard Windows app and a swf file (the old Flash format) that is tested as working on both Windows and Mac using a player like Elmedia. On Apple silicon Macs make sure to launch Elmedia in Rosetta mode and the game will run. Also working in the Ruffle app with some minor visual glitches but it\u2019s still is playable. I recommend Elmedia as it preserves the graphics the way they should look. Being them vector, you can enlarge the window and keep crisp high definition graphics.\r\n<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>It has a local 2 player mode to play with a friend, or to up the challenge for a single person by controlling two Kukos at once. This is given as-is, with keyboard controls that I wish I could fix (and add mouse control which would be much better) but unfortunately I am not a programmer and can\u2019t reach the guy who originally coded the game (but yes I do own the game and made all the graphics). I recommend pressing the keys in sharp tiny bursts for better control\u2026\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The leaderboards don\u2019t work (they used to in the original release) and there is no saving.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n</p>\n<p>One player: arrow keys and DOWN to launch ball/shoot bullets with devil power-up.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Second player: Z, X, C (not WASD) with X to launch/shoot.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You can turn off sound and reset the game with the buttons on the top right corner.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Original music by electronic artist BOLQUIO.
