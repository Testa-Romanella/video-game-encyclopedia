All graphics are currently still placeholders and need a rework. But this demo should give you a first impression of the gameplay. There are 2 short maps in the demo, which are unfinished yet.\u00a0The game is mostly inspired by \"Eye of the Beholder\" and \"Legend of Grimrock\". If you find bugs or if you hae just\u00a0feedback, just leave me a note.</p>\n<p>If you want to support the project, please donate, so i can extend the game with more\u00a0assets.
