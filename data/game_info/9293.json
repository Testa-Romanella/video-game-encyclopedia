To maximize damage, it is best to be facing your enemies directly before pressing the right &amp;quot;Weapons/Fire&amp;quot; button. Holding the left &amp;quot;Shield&amp;quot; button will allow you to deflect the enemy projectiles. Prolonged use of the Weapons/Shields will cause a temporary overload. Note that it is NOT possible to fire your weapons while Shields are active.<br/><br/>When engaged in battle, your ship will automatically level-up in an RPG-like fashion allowing you to unlock new shields and weapons.<br/><br/>Successfully completing each mission will unlock new game levels. Replaying any of the missions without failing will provide you with an added degree of difficulty. For an even greater endless challenge, try your luck at the survival-style &amp;quot;Gauntlet&amp;quot; simulation levels, which will be automatically unlocked upon successful completion of all story driven missions.<br/><br/>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In-Game Options Menu allows you to adjust:<br/><br/>Tilt Controls: &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; (default), &amp;quot;Reversed&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Off&amp;quot;: disables the tilt controls altogether in favor of tapping your enemies.<br/><br/>Button Location: &amp;quot;Bottom&amp;quot; (default on iPhone/iPod-Touch), &amp;quot;Middle&amp;quot; (default on iPad) and &amp;quot;Top&amp;quot;: aimed at iPad users who wish to avoid tilting in favor of tap controls.<br/><br/>Background: &amp;quot;Moving&amp;quot; (default): compensates the game&amp;#39;s background as you tilt the screen, or &amp;quot;Fixed&amp;quot;: old-school non-moving background. If you experience discomfort with the game&amp;#39;s tilting motion, the &amp;quot;Fixed&amp;quot; background setting may be preferred.
