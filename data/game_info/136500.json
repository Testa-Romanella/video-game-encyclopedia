The game is simple and can be played using either keyboard or gamepad, but I recommend that you play with the gamepad as using two thumbsticks is\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0easier than trying to use keyboard.</p>\n<p>The game can also be played in 2 Player mode, where the player with the highest score after all the lives are lost wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f666cc36a4cc96bfd556e649daa11d7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nocturne Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
