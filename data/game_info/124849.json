{"id": 124849, "slug": "bloodew-valley", "name": "Bloodew Valley", "name_original": "Bloodew Valley", "description": "<p>For the Ludum Dare 41, I mixed a farming simulator game (such as Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley) and a survival horror game.</p>\n<p>The instructions and credits are inside the game. If you are in a hurrry, you can press C to cheat so you get more gold and life. You can also skip the day cycle with N (and advance to 6PM by pressing it one more time).</p>\n<p>I do recommend you read the instructions on the main menu. If you pay attention to the messages when playing a new game, that's also enough. If you do neither, it will probably be confusing (the most confusing thing: if you don't have 2000g by the end of the second day, that you can earn by planting 10 carrots or cheating, you will die).</p>\n<p>I hope you like it!
