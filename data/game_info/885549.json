One morning, the Queen makes an announcement to all of her subjects: a powerful magic curse is leading to the town, a curse that only ASCII worlds can have: slowly, but inexorably, everything is turning into <strong>not-translatable characters</strong>(Like \ufffd).</p>\n<p>The Queen is sure that the non-translatable pest is caused by somebody, an infector who spreads the curse to damage nearby kingdoms, and capturing them will stop the plague; she therefore put a huge bounty on the head of this mysteryous person, and whoever will bring her enough proofs will become a hero AND a very rich person.</p>\n<p>In all this, you are just a common villager. Will you spend the day hunting and completing random side quests? Or will you help and find the infector? (Actually, is there an infector at all? Is there a plague at all? Will this random object be useful for some quest?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>ASCII Quest is basically a text adventure, where you click on an option to perform an action, but there's also a time factor: in fact, the game world reacts to the game time, as any real word would (for example, if in the game it's 12:30, most places will be closed for lunch). </p>\n<p>Some actions will require time to be completed. The time taken by an action is usually displayed near the option.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: certain actions may lie about the time they take, so that you won't be able to assume their outcome.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><em>More\u00a0details\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0game's Instrucions\u00a0page</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T10:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e79d13f2602881c66f36e4dccb64dde8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cookie_CHR"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
