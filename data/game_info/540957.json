Then, wait and enjoy.</p><p>My main objective while developing out this project was to tackle for the\u00a0first time the programmation of\u00a0AI and simulating an autonomous ecosystem. I have\u00a0then attempted to represent the phenomenon of \u201cgenetic migration\u201d, which is in\u00a0population genetics: \"an exchange of genes between individuals, generally at\u00a0within the same species \".\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each young rabbit resulting from a mating inherits between 20% and 80% of the color of its parents. Thus, within the same litter, some pups may \"hold more\" of one parent rather than the other. In the end, it is this property that makes this phenomenon of \u201cgenetic migration\u201d really observable. After a a certain time, after about 2 minutes of life of this ecosystem, we observe a homogenization of the coat color of rabbits, a color that turns out to be the \u201caverage\u201d of all the colors of the manually created rabbits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T06:48:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a0b72b6810c6bb76b0ba9ad8f661df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas Zelv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
