Unfortunately it's never as straightforward as it sounds and casualties are inevitable. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAmong the chaos you'll find nearly twenty types of humans, including six rare characters and 12 items that will drastically change the game as you play. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tOperating the bridges effectively takes coordination, multi-tasking and quick thinking. The game also can also be played by two players, each controlling and watching one bridge. \r\n\t\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/860/86086ebe4a161227303427913e5b1319.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danthedev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
