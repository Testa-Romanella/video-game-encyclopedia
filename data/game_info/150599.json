You can now start adding the contents of your plates (<strong>down arrow</strong> below plate) and adjust the temperature (<strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong> below the cauldron). When your mix is ready, cool it down and put it in a glass by clicking\u00a0<strong>done</strong>.</p>\n<p>The customers will knock on your door, you have to <strong>answer</strong> their knocks and let them in. Then they will tell you what potion they want and you can decide to <strong>accept </strong>(they will come back for the completed potion later), <strong>decline</strong> (they will walk away) or <strong>give</strong> them a potion you made earlier (drag to their slot).</p>\n<p>When your customers are\u00a0back, drag the completed potions to the slot near them and choose <strong>give</strong>.</p>\n<p>They will walk away and give you feedback. Your goal is to get as good feedbacks as possible and be in the Top 10 of the wiches in the country.</p>\n<p>A one guy with not much free time project.</p>\n<p>Using the free font\u00a0Compassion\u00a0by\u00a0Eeve Somepx.
