When you're finished save it off to keep forever.</p><p>In the game after your tree is grown there are two buttons that export from the game. One with a tree icon exports the OBJ of your tree as well as a single texture used to render the tree. The camera icon will take a shot of your screen and spit that out. Both of these files should be in the directory where you unzipped the game. If your mesh ends up black in your modeling app try unlocking and or reversing the normals.</p><p>Enjoy! and check out the trees others have made at https://twitter.com/bonsaibeautiful</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b3/2b37134961f9c86e1ae74a20ed16398f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Chris Wade"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
