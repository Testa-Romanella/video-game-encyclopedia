Click on it to sell it. If you exceed the maximum money limit, the taxes will catch you and you will lose. But if you go below the minimum limit you won't be able to pay the rent, so you'll lose. Try to get as much money as you can without going over the limit to earn points.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is my first GameJam, I started creating video games 2 years ago. I'm happy to have participated in this TriJam. I made this game in 3 hours and 30 minutes. The visuals were generated by MidJourney and Stable Diffusion (I'm a poor graphic designer).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you like the game !</p>\n<p>TruitoxVRC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T12:18:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f55/f55a628daafe823105dbde590c6c3e06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TruitoxVRC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
