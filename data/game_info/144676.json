It started out as an extra credit project for my beginning programming class. I thought I'd post the project online, and in the future I\u00a0hope to post a tutorial outlining basic coding for games.</p>\n<p>In Super Console Dungeon Game, the goal is to enter the dungeon and find as much treasure as possible. Falling in a trap will return you to the first floor and failing to defeat monsters will cause you to loose treasure.</p>\n<p>*The further you are in the dungeon, the less treasure you loose.</p>\n<p>The game will go on forever if you keep playing, so enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff6797a754a0db854b7e7e7813625c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragoon Domain"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
