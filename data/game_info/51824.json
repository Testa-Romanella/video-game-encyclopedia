But something goes wrong, and you are the only person, who can save the station.<br/><br/>Find your way through the testing chambers filled with a ubiquitous gravity bending field. Your sense of direction will be challenged in a way you've never experienced before. Try not to become dizzy from the constant change of gravity.Features<ul><li> Floating platforms<br/></li><li> Gravity turners<br/></li><li> Gravity resetters<br/></li><li> Use boxes to connect givers/receivers of power to open doors<br/></li><li> 30 levels of increasing difficulty<br/></li><li> A trapped scientist guiding you remotely via the communication system\t<br/></li><li> Dizziness from the ever changing gravity</li></ul>Items you will use to solve the puzzles<ul><li> Floating platforms held in place by the artificial gravity.
