It's a very basic pen and paper RPG thing that can be played with two players (or more if you're creative, or less if you're really creative.) You just need at least one six-sided die and something to record stuff on.</p><p>Warning: The game is not balanced at all. But if you wanted balance you are probably looking through the wrong jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["peppertsuki"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
