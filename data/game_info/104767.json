Games in 2011. It's never gotten much of an audience, but we're hoping to give it more exposure here. Hope everyone enjoys the game.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0Tip: plays best with a gamepad, and analog sticks don't work.</p><ul><li>Screen Resolution: 1280x720</li></ul><ul><li>Operating Systems: Windows XP and 7\u00a0</li></ul><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Review</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b3585fceae2030522e443f7226447237.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TwO Bros."], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
