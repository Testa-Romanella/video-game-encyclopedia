Shoot solar flares at planets. They will slow down and drop into a lower orbit.\u00a0 When they get close enough you consume them. Solar flares deplete your stars size. consuming planets increase your stars size. If you don't shoot a flare for awhile you will shoot occasionaly as you outgass. If your star becomes too small it becomes a black hole and you lose.</p><p><strong>completed code I added to make planets gradually drop down to smaller orbits instead of jumping</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad control added</strong></p>\n<p><strong>fixed collision shape of sun. hopefully this helps the issue where its hard to tell when a planet is eaten.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a small game that was made in a weekend for a gamejam called Como\u00a0Gamejam 3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55bb532ed3749824e97847ebdb983ca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["geekdude"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
