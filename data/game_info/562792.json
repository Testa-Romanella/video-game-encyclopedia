It's a busy place, so try not to cause traffic jams, or more importantly, any accidents. When you succeed, try to cut down on the timing to get a better score!</p><p>Your code is saved automatically.</p>\r\nThe levels\r\n<ul><li>The tutorial level: Simple enough. Just merge two one-way roads onto another shared one-way road.</li><li>Level 1: A classic 4-way road. Autonomous cars can't tell when to make discretionary left turns though, so you'll have to guide them.</li><li>Level 2:\u00a0A big road connecting into a small road. The small road's traffic ranges from nothing to quite a decent bit of traffic, so you'll have some induction pads to detect when cars are on the small road.</li></ul>\r\nSample code\r\n\r\nloop:\r\n// 0 goes first\r\ngreen 0\r\nwait 3\r\n// make 0 red, then wait for intersection to clear\r\nred 0\r\nwait 1\r\n// 1 goes second\r\ngreen 1\r\nwait 3\r\n// wait for intersection to clear again\r\nred 1\r\nwait 1\r\n// repeat\r\ngoto loop\r\nCommand reference\r\n\r\nGREEN X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X and more to green\r\nRED X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X and more to red\r\nGREENLEFT X -&gt; Sets traffic light X's left arrow to green\r\nGREENRIGHT X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X's right arrow to green\r\nREDLEFT X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X's left arrow to red\r\nREDRIGHT X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X's right arrow to red\r\nCLEARLEFT X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X's left arrow to nothing\r\nCLEARRIGHT X... -&gt; Sets traffic light X's right arrow to nothing\r\nX: -&gt; Represents a label X for GOTO (no instructions on the same line for now)\r\nGOTO X -&gt; Jumps execution to label X\r\nWAIT X -&gt; Waits X seconds\r\nSET X Y -&gt; Sets variable X to a number\r\nADD X Y -&gt; Adds variable X to a number.\r\nREAD X Y -&gt; Sets variable X to induction sensor Y (1 = has car, 0 = no car)\r\nIFNEG X Y -&gt; Jumps to label Y if variable X is negative\r\nIFPOS X Y -&gt; Jumps to label Y if variable X is positive", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:20:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf8/bf84977760eb8addc945d852f58760c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lim Ding Wen"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
