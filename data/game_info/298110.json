Some levels may be modified and more will be added before full launch for other platforms also. Please, play through 14 first levels and give comments to help me improving the game.</em></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>In the year 2121, the State banned all games of luck as an anti-government activity. All dice were put behind the bars... or actually sent to a maze prison from where a poor die could not escape with pure luck. Would you like to help a die to escape from the maze prison?</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>For each move, the die can roll exactly the number of dots on its top face. If the die collides with a blocking wall it continues in opposite direction.</p>\n<p>Some levels can be escaped by reaching the escape finish tile using any number of moves. Some levels require a certain number of moves to pass. Some levels have a time limit.<br/>If the die gets stuck in the maze, you may randomize the die. This costs you extra move or seconds.<br/>Unlock all the dots of the die to Escape from the Maze Prison.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io:<br/>\"Thunder Dreams\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>Licence: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde4b1473518423ba24876d2133bf843.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ArchiusComus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
