But no punching, kicking, or weapons allowed! Your hoverbike is your only weapon.</p><p><strong>Planned Final Features</strong></p>- At least 10 different hoverbikes with simple controls that are easy to learn, yet difficult to master. <br/>- At least 12 tracks, 6 arenas, and 6 capture-the-flag courses across 6 different environments. <br/>- Select your bike, suit, helmet, and colors, then tune your bike so it handles just how you like it. <br/>- Semi-wacky but not-too-wacky physics. Moderate wackiness. (With ragdolls, of course!) <br/>- Single-player and multi-player, local or online, with or without bots. <br/>- Modes to include: Racing, Deathmatch/Arena Joust, Capture the Flag, Practice, eventually others.<br/>- Reasonably low system-requirements. (TBD) <br/>- Proper in-game options and re-bindable controls (controllers with analog inputs recommended, but not required). <br/>- Steam leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards <br/>- Would also love to add a track editor and Steam Workshop support if there is enough demand from the community<p><strong>Development &amp; Release</strong></p>- This game is a solo-project (design+code+art+sound+music) by Phillip Foshee, AKA Brantisky Interactive. <br/>- When most of the main features and at least half of the game's content are finished, the game will be released as paid Early Access for a reasonable price (adjusted according to region).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e34/e34325b7b0d961d72e3aceeaeaf1219b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brantisky"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
