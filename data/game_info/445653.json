Hold the line and keep your tower standing for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>The game mechanics for this prototype are mostly tested and seemingly working, however such aspects as the income of gold, the higher level waves, balancing of different unit types, late game, are yet to be tested. Any feedback at all would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742faac25e4eb701f0cbf6fd9b46440f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Lawton"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
