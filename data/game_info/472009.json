Join me and give feedback while I develop this game over the next year.<br/><br/>This and later versions will be free to play until I\u00a0reach a point where the core gameplay loop and concepts are solidified. Afterwards, I will decide whether I put in the game in an alpha/beta phase with restricted access.<br/><br/>As of this version, 90% of the art and animations come from\u00a0https://pixel-frog.itch.io/kings-and-pigs, used as placeholder for now to focus on gameplay, programming\u00a0and level design.<br/><br/>All the other work you see is done solely by myself.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:52:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c4/0c449de2c040c2519204c4e2e213a3b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["itsIzzac"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
