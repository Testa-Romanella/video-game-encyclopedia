But there's a problem- despite looking like a young, attractive woman, she can't hide the sound of her goat-like satanic legs, unless she walks on the soft grass. Will you be able to hunt down the drank without being discovered?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team choose to follow the theme of<strong> Retelling A Tale</strong>, going back to the tall tales of one of Brazil's most dominant ancestry. We used the AIs of Stable Diffusion and Dream by Wombo to make the art and made a dynamic music track to reflect the danger in your current state.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Team: MisoJam</p>\n<ul><li>Eitan Medina - Music<br/>\n</li><li>Ohad Reshef - Art</li><li>Ido Adler - Programming</li></ul>\n\n<p>Themes:</p>\n<ul><li>Retelling A Tale</li><li>Easy to play, hard to be good</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T11:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c4/2c484859cded4000c04ee4b202058284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ido Adler", "Ohad Reshef"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
