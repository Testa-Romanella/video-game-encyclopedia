Developed for the KenneyJam 2017 it was designed and developed on one weekend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a Google Daydream Game, so you have to use a Daydream View Headset to play it.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Only made with graphic-assets from Kenney.nl, this game is a low-poly shooter. Pretty basic, but it was fun to code it. Hope someone also has fun playing it. If someone is interested, I may continue this project. Just tell me what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf1/cf11ee44798cf5897c05752f6c902831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["boeserwolf85"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
