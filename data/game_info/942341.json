She hasn\u2019t heard from him since Friday (May 20, 2005) and contacted us today (Monday) to investigate. His workplace (the office of a teeny tiny assets team from Saffrona Inc., the big video game development company) was the last place anyone saw him!! So at around 1:30 PM today we sent home the employees.\r\n<br/><br/>What we know is Mr. Bishop is his team\u2019s Producer, overseeing budgeting and scheduling of their projects. This case\u2019s suspects are actually\u2026 his colleagues! 0.0 Testimonies show they were the last ones to see him on Friday.<br/>Here\u2019s a list of them:</p>\n<ul><li>Harvey Redford, the team lead\u00a0</li><li>Elizabeth Mills, the information architect\u00a0</li><li>Jonathan White, the writer</li><li>Ivy Jaslene, the artist intern\u00a0</li><li>Billy Mason, the programmer intern</li></ul>\n<p>Couldn\u2019t really search through this place myself, but I interviewed them earlier and left you some summaries. (Aren\u2019t I an amazing partner?!) I need you to explore this office and let me know what you think happened to him. Write any important notes or info in your journal. Once you think you\u2019ve cracked this case, send me those details of your accusation, and I'll look into it and report the findings back to you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck detective, we\u2019ve got this!! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:25:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/622fd2ecf12312925fc8f57be0fe69c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saffrona", "lydschung", "Trevor Vahan", "Qwerty8080", "Edleen Tong", "Sarkazam", "lhkhuat", "joannaywan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
