But nothing is as it seems, and the player will have to make some very difficult choices and not always with an apparent solution, and this choices will affect in a major way in the continuing of the story. The old lie does not point to a frenetic gameplay and advanced graphics, but it prefers to make the player reflect on the things that we now rarely seen, showing how the world is not composed only by white and black, but by a big gray scale. The game runs on Unity and is currently only available for Windows, but we are also working on a Android version. The old lie is currently fully translated in English and Italian.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a game that is not based only on the fast-paced action or on fantastic graphics, but if you are looking for an interactive story that knows how to you engage you, how to make you reflect and maybe even how to excite you then we think The old lie it's a good choice for you.</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your attention and have fun.</p>\n<p>A Fabulas game production</p>\n<p>Music by Eric Matyas  www.soundimage.org</p>\n<p>Trailer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f41f2d37e0ae2236458bebddc54c8ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabulas Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
