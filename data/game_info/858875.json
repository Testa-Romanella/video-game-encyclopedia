It's a puzzle-platformer about a small fluff of mildew that runs around collecting little moldy guys. In this game, the player is capable of ground-pounding into potted plants and using their abilities to their advantage, like a dandelion gives you the ability to double jump, etc., etc..\u00a0It's\u00a0heavily unfinished so apologies if you get soft-locked anywhere in the game!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is played with the arrow keys using space as the select button to leave pots and z to jump. Ground-pounding can be done by pressing the down arrow.</p>\n<p>The art and levels were designed by me while the game was programmed by my buddy Jordan</p><p>Update: Fixed a waterfall bug in level 2 that prevented the player from progressing. Also fixed a bug that prevented the player from taking damage in water.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T14:41:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccd/ccd8c39558167615d07716b354d431c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jordan--vision", "kindaokev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
