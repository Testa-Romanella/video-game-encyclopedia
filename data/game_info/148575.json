You can create your own skins and your own campaigns.<br/><br/>An important feature is the solver which ensures that your puzzle is solvable (except in cases where the grid is overcrowded). This is a departure from most throwaway minesweeper games where you can get impossible puzzles.<h3>How to play </h3><br/>left click to open a tile, right click to add a flag, then again to turn that flag into a question mark, hold right mouse button or middle mouse button to move the grid around. scroll wheel to zoom in and out.<br/><br/>When you hold the middle mouse button it will light up the nearby tiles. so if a tile says 4, the 4 bombs will be within the lit up tiles. this is especially useful for new players and the new sphere mode.  <br/><br/>collect gems to change your pet's colour. as it eats more gems, the effect gets less so you can fine tune it. <br/>Complete campaign puzzles and it will evolve to second and then third form. in third form, you can complete even more campaigns to gain accessories for the pet. <br/><br/>Collect sweepers or magnets for the pet to use on your puzzle and give you an advantage!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T02:58:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e5510e02f2253721f0f654153726c62.jpg", "website": "https://triadne.wordpress.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["triadne"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Triadne"], "esrb_rating": null}
