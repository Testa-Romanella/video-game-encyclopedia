Beware- you have 5 \"health\" in the form of bones. If you lose all of your bones, you become just a SKULL.</p>\n<p>As a skull, you must reconfigure your body! Collect 5 BONES by rolling over them to collect yourself together, and begin anew!</p>\n<p>There are various ITEMS strewn about the coliseum, and which are \"thrown\" from the stands periodically. Run over these items to pick them up, and then throw them at your enemies to inflict damage.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Walking over a Helmet will cause your skeleton to equip it, like a true knight! (Unfortunately, confers no benefit).\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Enemies can pick up these items as well; each time you are struck by an enemy projectile, you will lose ONE bone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beware of the WALL SPIKES! Running into these spikes, be it as a skeleton or a skull, will confer a loss of TWO bones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you are not able to collect enough bones in time, and your SKULL loses all of its hit points, you will\u00a0DIE.\u00a0Game over.</p>\n\n\n<p>GAME NOTES</p>\n<p>Thanks so much to you, for reading this, and for trying our game!</p>\n<p>Here is a short list of the things we were not able to accomplish, and the goals for a future v2:</p>\n<p>-Primary attack (swing): Adding an additional form of attack in the form of a melee hit/swing. Although projectiles are threatening, there is a lack of flexibility when enemies don't have items (cause right now, the enemy skeletons just seem like they really want to hug you...)</p>\n<p>-Mouse pointer/assistant: Adding some form of cursor or ray to better help the player understand the location of their mouse in the scene.\u00a0There is currently a lack of ability to see exactly where the player's mouse is in relation to where your skeleton is looking.</p>\n<p>-Improved enemy AI: Fighting the player, fighting each other (as is consistent with an arena), better targeting, more intuitive movement, etc!</p>\n<p>-Improved SFX: Although music and sounds made it into the game, there is only one present sound effect and there should be more to represent other aspects of the game (picking up a bone or an item, equipping an item, dying, despawning, etc). Also, the SFX for getting hit doesn't work on the player, for some reason.</p>\n<p>-Extras: Bone despawning, UI updates (counter for how many enemies are killed by the player), BACKSTORY? The problems options are limitless.</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>@Aria - Art, Animation, Modeling,\u00a0Game Design</p>\n<p>@Elrobo\u00a0- Programming,\u00a0Animation,\u00a0Game Design, Leadershio</p>\n<p>@Kryndir - Game Design, Programming, Audio/Music, Humor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71edb1387c3b3ce9312011c4e6a24eac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kryndir"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
