Some whole pizzas may still be frozen - Wait what, frozen pizza falling from the sky on a sunny day, while everything else is thawed? Video game logic, don't question it!!! Use a fireball to cook it before catching. But don't overcook a pizza, or you'll just burn it and lose points!\r\n</p>\n<p>Food that reaches the ground will accumulate and attract wasps that steal pizza, so use your sword to clean it up. You can also hit wasps with your sword attack to get rid of them. However, you'll lose points if you are stung, so keep moving. Beware of Yellow Jackets - wasps that not only steal pizza and sting you, but can also shoot plasma at you! Parry their projectiles with your sword.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>Move = Arrow keys\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoot fireball = S\r\n</p>\n<p>Sword attack = D\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T14:01:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aca/aca127b52153bb5c530ecfc350805c70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["CynthiasGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
