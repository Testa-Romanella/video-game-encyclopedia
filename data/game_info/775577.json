My game is created with my patients in mind as a way to help them calm themselves with they are feeling anxious or overwhelmed. My recent features include a sphere that can be used as a way for one to manage their breathing. If one does not need this feature a simple click can have it removed. The next feature I like to call, meditating cubes because as the game begins they are floating over one another and eventually stack up and fall so that my third and final feature, which I call player cube can be used to knock down all three meditation cubes with the usage of the arrow keys or jump over them with the usage of the spacebar in a fun game to help one relax. I want the user to feel less anxious and calm when they interact with this game and its new features. All new features include either rotating and/or scaling animation.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T10:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f9/9f922a54abd38da1b912f2aa5fd8f95c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jeo29"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
