And in this world, where one company rules over video games with an iron fist, it's up to one person to determine the fate of the world. Will you guide Duncan on his way up the corporate ladder, bringing reform to this massive monopoly? Or will you join the indie developers attempting to take them down from the outside? Either way, you'll hack, slash or shoot your way through a mysterious world, set in the future but living in the past. Explore and interact with the dystopian residents, and fight using a modern turn-based hack-and-slash system that will keep you in the fight. Allies follow your commands most of the time, but they do tend to have a mind of their own. For a wacky take on a classic genre, look no further than Coffee Runner 2.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Explore one of two different stories!<br/>\r\n- Enjoy fast turn-based combat, with your turn becoming a strategic hack-and-slash!<br/>\r\n- Allies do whatever they want!
