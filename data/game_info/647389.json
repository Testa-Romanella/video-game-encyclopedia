The player will play with a character in third person, where the goal of the game is to escape the area. The user is given advance movement mechanics to be able to jump across platform ledges.

Features of grapple mechanic and character movement are demonstrated in the Gameplay Video made.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For this project I have worked individually to program the mechanics for the game as well as showcase them in a demo where the movement can be used for future games developed.
