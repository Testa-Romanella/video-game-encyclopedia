The player (white circle) is moved with the arrow keys or wasd keys. The aim of the game is to move the player through the different coloured circles in order to destroy the enemies of that type and gain points by doing so. If the player is touched by any of the enemy shapes they will die and the game will restart. This game was made using GameMaker Studio 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eed/eed15bcd234820fe8d90af6f4e00b084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tobler3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
