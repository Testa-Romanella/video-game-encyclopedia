The idea of this game jam is that everyone gets a letter from a giftee and writes a letter to a santa, so you make a game inspired by someone's letter and someone else makes a game for you! this game was made with the inspiration from GooseFairy's letter that reads the following:\u00a0</p>\n\n<em>Dear Santa, Hello! This will be my third year participating in this jam, and I'm super excited to see how it goes! I am pretty bad at introductions, but I'll tell you a bit about myself and maybe you'll get some ideas to run with. First things first, I love airplanes! I currently fly them for a living, and spend most of my time teaching people how to fly them too. Outside of that my hobbies revolve around making stuff. I like building robots! I currently have a tiny bot designed to tunnel through snow drifts, and another that will be competing in basically a team sport. I might be getting into battlebots too if I can afford it! I do a lot, one of my other favorite things is 2D animation, but it takes sooo long to animate haha. I wish I could ask for infinite time for xmas! That probably doesn't narrow things down much for you, so maybe I'll talk about games. I'm fond of movement puzzles and competitive aspects, whether it be trying to top a speedrunning leaderboard or outsmart an AI. My favorite games are Team Fortress 2, Rocket League, Cave Story, Kerbal Space Program, Portal, and Minecraft to name a few. Competition / Movement / Puzzles / some sandboxyness. I have a good fascination towards AI, either working with or against it, but I also have heavy respect for the amount of work they require to make, so certainly don't bite off more than you can chew if you decide on that route! I'm on a Windows machine with very good hardware, so anything from 8-bit to raytraced is all good. I prefer playable over pretty though, so don't worry too much about making fancy assets. Oh yeah, whatever you end up doing, make sure you're having fun! Love, GooseFairy</em>\n<p>I mainly focused on the airplanes and movement side of things, and although I only really made the game in a couple of days during the almost month long period I still think it's worth a play. Music taken from youtube audio library and some of the art created by AI and vectorized by another! Although most assets were made by me (The planes are emojis \u2708\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01).</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>space/mouse click to lift off</p>\n<p>move mouse to move and avoid the enemy forces!</p>\n<p>Hint: if your plane doesn't fly to the middle of the screen when pressing space/clicking, click again or refresh the page!</p>\n\r\nPoster for the game made using AI!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:12:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7da/7dacad20cfad8090525ba8fd2202f0f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr Craft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
