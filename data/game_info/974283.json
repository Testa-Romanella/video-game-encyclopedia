{"id": 974283, "slug": "bloodsong", "name": "BLOODSONG", "name_original": "BLOODSONG", "description": "Tenacious and musically gifted, Mari is everything a siren queen\u2019s daughter ought to be. Except for the fact that her punk rock bloodsong power can make a simple melody more like a deadly explosive. With this weapon and sheer rebellious spirit, Mari seeks to escape her palace confines in order to headline her band's concert. Traversing through the cavernous dungeons might have been easy, if it weren\u2019t for rogue enemies of a sleazy undersea shanty town thwarting her every move. Mari must rock on with her bloodsong, blast a few eardrums along the way, and get to her concert\u2013before her queen mother\u2019s army gets to her first.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA twist on an action rhythm game, BLOODSONG entices players to use their musical pitch-matching ear as a form of combat. Listen to enemies\u2019 bloodsongs\u2013that is, their main musical melody\u2013in order to learn how to defeat them. As you explore the atmospheric undersea world of the sirens, face off against biting anglerfish and cheeky crabs, all in order to get Mari to the stage. And prove, once and for all, that nothing is a match for teenage angst.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T06:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07fbc100a7d0eec39ffe3095d5c13c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Three Owls In a Trench Coat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Three Owls In a Trench Coat"], "esrb_rating": null}
