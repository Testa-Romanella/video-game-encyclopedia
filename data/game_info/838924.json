Long ago the frog nations lived in harmony, but then the bug nation\u00a0attacked. Protect the unseen flower field from the dastardly bugs with your froggy companions, tongues at the ready.\u00a0<br/></p><p>If this is your first tower defense game, here's how you play! After you select a stage, use the bottom menu to select a frog and place it along the path. Press Start and hope the frog eats all the bugs that come through! Killing bugs earns money; use it to buy more frogs to defend the path. See how long you can survive!<br/></p>\n<p>Some pro-gamer tips for you:</p>\n<ul><li>Green frogs are average but cheap.</li><li>Spicy frogs are fast but weak, while Bullfrogs are strong but slow.</li><li>Poison frogs both damage and slow any bugs near them.</li><li>Sniper frogs can reach bugs from anywhere on the map.</li><li>Helper frogs buff nearby frogs' power and speed. (broken in this build, oops)</li><li>Frogs can be upgraded! Try clicking them after they're placed down.</li><li>Holding Space will speed up the game!</li></ul>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS (haha, bugs.) <strong>These will be fixed once game jam voting is over</strong>, sorry friends.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Wave 40 will kill you instantly.\r\n</li><li>Helper Frogs, um, don't do anything...\r\n</li><li>Various menu issues</li></ul>\n<p>The game is still in active development, and some things are subject to change! Wave progress/balancing is still being worked on, and currently only 60/100 waves are playable. Look forward to more content soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:18:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfb/dfb56d51ca7b6c2240b6f08e3b3c0f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["pinapl", "Jay2a", "Cmacle", "Krispy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
