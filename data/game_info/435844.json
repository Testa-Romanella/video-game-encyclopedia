I did not have time to balance out the difficulty. Be prepared for a challenge.\r\n<p>Your mission is to extract the goldfish who swallowed the\u00a0microfilm macguffin and bring it back to headquarters alive. Put\u00a0your puzzle-platforming skills to the test with\u00a010 nefarious levels that will have you dodging heinous lasers,\u00a0treacherous turrets, and evil pools of lava. Good luck, Agent!</p>\n\n<p>No Fish To Die\u00a0supports both keyboard and gamepad controls.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T15:00:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6d/b6df528a8ff6c949db6cdbb915e6baf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BCKR"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
