After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Lord Yuz has bid you travel far south to the country of Caspara and the city of Al-Khamsin. There, in the palace, his cousin Princess Yasmine lies under the spell of the great dragon king, Bethlusaa, whose spirit lives on, captured in a magical tome.<br/><br/>Your mission is to find that book and exorcise Bethlusaa's spirit to the realm of the dead. Meanwhile, a great mage is also interested in the book and its inhabitant. Mage Nur Ali has set deadly snares for you. You'll need all your wits and prowess to stay alive in this exotic land and finish your assignment!<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select \"HordeII\" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 35 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest Classic - Mithril Horde II has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e8/5e859241b362c476ca7f15a68344c878.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
