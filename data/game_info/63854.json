The government asked scientists to examine it. Dr. Joseph was one of those scientists. Strange events began to happen in the underground lab, and something went wrong, causing a strong earthquake. The experiment was halted and classified, while the territory of the town was closed. Nobody knew what had happened to Joseph, and he was listed as a missing person. Fifteen years later his daughter Rachel is on the verge of solving the mystery, but somebody is doing everything possible to keep her from succeeding. Rachel is institutionalized in a secret mental hospital. She starts having horrible nightmares in which her father is pleading for her help and talking about a looming catastrophe.
