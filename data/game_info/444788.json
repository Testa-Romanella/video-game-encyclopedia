You can explore the island but\u00a0there are currently no puzzles or objectives.\u00a0 For this release I've focused on first person controls, directional sound and visual\u00a0aesthetics.\u00a0I also spent time on improving WebGL performance. If you do play this prototype I would love to know\u00a0at what quality setting you're able to achieve 60fps. I am able to get 60fps at 75% quality without a 3D graphics card and 100% quality with the 3D card enabled.\u00a0You can get the frame rate by pressing the spacebar in-game.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Enter</strong> : Settings Menu<br/><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Escape</strong> : Exit Fullscreen<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0Movement<br/><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Mouse</strong> : Look Around</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Art</strong> : Luis Fernandez (luyssport.artstation.com)<br/><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Music</strong> : Benjamin Burnes (abstractionmusic.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b7275fe0645f1bc8a133222716eaf4c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itizso"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
