You are a piano player walking to the stage. When you enter the curtains, things are starting to change. Objects appear, move, dissappear and eventually explode. My intention was to discover what was possible with Unity3D. My approach was to avoid conventional gameplay like using words, hints, score bars or pointers.</p>\n<p>*There\u00a0 is a major (!) bug after the third scene, where you move through clouds. If you get stuck, the screen will stay white. Sorry for the technical difficulties but you have to restart the game. To get to the next scene, make sure to press the left mouse button the whole time! My technical skill were not great back then.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:35:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b8/4b8d384f5c160e87569ad1623fbb35bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charlotte Madelon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
