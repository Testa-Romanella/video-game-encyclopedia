You have cleverly weaponised this virus and have one shot (one opportunity) to transmit the infectious plague into the hideout of your enemies. Once you have released your virus, all you can do is watch as the virus spreads relentlessly throughout the hideout, so make sure that you place and time your shot well in order to get the highest score possible! There is an incubation period for the virus before it transmits outwards and infects anything nearby, so carefully time and plan your target as you fire....or just brute-force the virus and try and try again!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/474846cd9023a4658b4e2fa6f5e51296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["necron_warrior"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
