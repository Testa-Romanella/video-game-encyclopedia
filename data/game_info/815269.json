Once you have used all your action points (2 by default, aside the character image), you can click on end turn and pray. If you don't have any unit selected, you also can hover enemies to see their move and attack range (they only have one action point per turn each).</p><p>This is normal to lose ! You won't lose your \u00a0new pilot's capacity between runs, so you will get it.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy, don't hesitate to ask me some question, I'll be glad to awnser !</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's getting late for me (1:06 AM), see you around ;)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:02:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba307aa0cd7e25ff45e39c5f76f72e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Le_Z"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
