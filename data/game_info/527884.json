Who will get the glory of being the one to stop the streamer?</p>\n<p>On top of that, there's a whole range of different surprises that Chat can unleash upon the streamer. Some are cute, some are distracting and some just makes the run a lot harder. Who knows what might happen?</p>\n<p>For non-streamers, there's also an Offline Mode where you can test out what it'll be like for the streamer playing, where an AI will try to replicate the chat.
