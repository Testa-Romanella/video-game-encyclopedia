As fleet commander, it's your job to make the call: do you save the damaged military destroyer to add more firepower to your fleet, the tanker that will extend the fleet's range, or rescue the farmship capable of producing enough food to keep your people alive?Events<br/>You'll encounter ships under distress, desperate refugees, greedy merchants, wreckage and caches to loot, shipyards and stations, enemy traps... and much more in over 400 hand-crafted events.Politics<br/>You are faced with a fractured political landscape where five factions squabble and fight.  Your actions will have a direct impact on the relations between the factions.  Do you try to unite them all, take sides, play them against one another or shoot first and ask questions later?<br/><br/>Each situation you encounter will require thoughtful leadership. Demands, urgent calls for help, and interesting opportunities will present themselves, often at your most trying moments.<br/><br/>Faction leaders provide you additional political tools including intimidation, diplomacy and haggling.Combat, Weapons and Movement<br/>The action takes place in close orbit around planets.  Ships fly on a 2D plane; inertia acts against ships.  Acceleration/deceleration, turn rates and weapon ranges make a difference.  Custom formations allow you to make the most of your offensive and defensive capabilities.  Warships can be issued Rules of Engagement (ROEs) limiting their combat actions.<br/><br/>There are several types of weapons at your disposal, lasers, missiles, mines, shields and the devastating nuke.  <br/><br/>However, one does not enter combat lightly; weapons drain your precious resources and can even delay your ability to jump away.Resources<br/>Resources are plentiful; time, however, is not. In order to keep your fleet going, you'll need water, fuel, and ore. Collection is automatic, but the time it takes to collect what you need may require the sacrifice of hundreds of brave souls. Wily and creative captains may also find these resources at space stations, depots, and aboard abandoned starships.<br/><br/><ul><li> <strong>Fuel</strong>: Easiest to find. Used for nearly everything, from laser weapons and shields to the powerful jump drives that fling you between stars.<br/></li><li> <strong>Water</strong>: Somewhat common.  Used primarily for factory foodships that feed the fleet.<br/></li><li> <strong>Ore</strong>: Slowest to obtain, somewhat rare.  Used for repairs, upgrades, missile-type weapons... and bribes.</li></ul><br/>Your exodus will take you to many worlds. You'll come across habitable worlds, gas giants, airless rocks, frozen wastelands, and hellish molten planets.  Each can be tapped for the precious resources you need to survive... provided you have the right ships in your fleet.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/9708973222ce5da8fe951b4369eee692.jpg", "website": "http://xo.jmpdrv.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jumpdrive Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jumpdrive Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
