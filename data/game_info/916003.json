Enemies appear every wave, and each time there are more and more of them, and they are stronger. At the same time, after each wave, mutations occur: an increase in one of the characteristics and a decrease in the other. After the completion of the wave, the time spent on the wave is compared with the average time per wave. If it is less, then the average time per wave in the next round will decrease and the mutations will have a rather negative effect, and if it is more, it will increase and the mutations will have a rather positive effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T13:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/622442f2ce145a6b8426305aa05b6e81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Den Den Dor", "HOKFMK", "pablowunderlich"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
