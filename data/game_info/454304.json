I've spent some spare time working on the build mechanics, and am at a point where i'm looking for some feedback for that. Use the feedback topic here:-\u00a0https://itch.io/t/825907/feedback-suggestions</p>\n<p>So here is a minimal prototype, where you can just call up a build menu, and create walls, floors and doors. Also added a O2 generator item, but that's only in there as a test, as i have no oxygen storage or power system, for it to actually work as it should! :D</p>\n<p>Note - all placeholder gfx and sfx\u00a0assets</p>\r\nWhat next?\r\n<p>Hopefully with some feedback, i can improve what is currently there, and i can move onto the next prototyping stage, which will probably be resource collection and storage systems.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c760addcb204cd595f0ffe5fad1385ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niris Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
