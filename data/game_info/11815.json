{"id": 11815, "slug": "crawl", "name": "Crawl", "name_original": "Crawl", "description": "<p>Crawl is 2D rogue-like game with beat em\u2019 up elements and heavy emphasis on local multiplayer.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In Crawl, up to four players or bots explore randomly generated dungeons. One player controls the hero while the other three are spirits.<br />\nThe goal of each run is to reach the exit, slay the final boss and escape from the dungeon. However, the only hero can do that. Killing hero as a spirit swaps roles and makes you hero giving you a chance to win.<br />\nThe spirits cannot attack directly but can possess monsters in traps scattered throughout the dungeon. The monsters differ in strength, health, speed, attacks, and abilities. Each player can advance by leveling up and getting new gear. Leveling up increases your stats and unlock new attacks and abilities. Spirits can also level up unlocking new monsters and objects to possess. The weapons and magical items can be found in the dungeon or bought from merchants. There are 25 types of weapons in the game that vary in stats and attack types.<br />\nAdditionally, each weapon can have one of 27 properties that can affect weapons damage, attack speed, give a chance to perform an elemental strike, or shot projectile. The maximum level in the game is ten after which the hero can face the dungeon boss. Other players must kill the hero by cooperatively controlling parts of the boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-14T09:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6d0078f12398f40c059be58ab3e300.jpg", "website": "http://www.crawlgame.com", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 84, "owned": 1274, "beaten": 55, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 55, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 228, "ratings_count": 126, "suggestions_count": 318, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 127, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Powerhoof"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Surprise Attack", "Powerhoof"], "esrb_rating": null}
