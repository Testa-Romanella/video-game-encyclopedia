There's an important bug found in the game. When you defeat Pumpo with a proyectile attack, the game will crash. It doesn't mean that the game is over, we just commited a mistake and we are sorry for that.\u00a0 If that's not the case, you can continue fighting with bosses. As it only happens with the first boss, if you are lucky and you avoid it, you can continue.\u00a0We'll probably fix it later once the Boss Rush Jam is over, in addition to other bugs that we could find. We'll agree your help and again, sorry for the problems.</p>\n<p>Here's the full OST of the game:</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>It's your turn to be The Death.\u00a0 In this new adventure, you'll have to create strategies with a random-weapon system for defeat weird and evil villains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>A and D: Move</li><li>Space: Jump</li><li>Space + space: Double jump</li><li>J: Attack</li><li>S + Space: Sweep</li><li>W + J: Special attack (only if the bar is ful)</li></ul>\n<p>From the developers:</p>\n<p>Hey!\u00a0This is the latest Badlife Games project.
