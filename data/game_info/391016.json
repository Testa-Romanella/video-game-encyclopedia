It features numerous powerups to use, enemies to blow up, and ships to fly.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>GLOBAL LEADERBOARDS</strong>\u00a0- Increase your score multiplier by defeating enemies. Keep it by avoiding damage. Keep that up and you'll be able to impress your friends and colleagues with your massive high score on the global Steam leaderboards!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>INFINITE WAVES OF ENEMIES</strong>\u00a0- Battle against an ever increasing horde of unique enemies! From small Drillers, to battleships who will send Miners to blow you up. Watch out for the asteroids too!<br/><br/><br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>POWERUPS AND WEAPONS</strong>\u00a0- Use powerups such as shotguns, shields, the roundhouse, the firehose and many more in order to survive a bit longer. Be careful, however, ammo is limited for powerups and your main weapon runs the chance of overheating.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-\u00a0<strong>FLY UNIQUE SHIPS</strong>\u00a0- When you blow up an enemy, they may drop a coin for you to collect. Use it to buy yourself a new ship. Each one has unique stats which will require different play styles as well as coming with its' own leaderboard!<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nFinal Note from the Developer\r\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out Space Mayhem!
