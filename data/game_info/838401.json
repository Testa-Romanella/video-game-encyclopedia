Unfortunately this crystal is\u00a0cursed! Whoever finds this crystal will suffer an endless wave of enemies, don't let the crystal break, your life is at stake!\u00a0It will be hard, but you must defend the crystal and become the <strong><em>CRYSTALLINE GUARD</em></strong>.</p>\n\r\n~~\u00a0GLITCH GUN ~~\r\n<p>Luckily you\u00a0brought your trusty <strong><em>GLITCH GUN</em></strong> with you on this journey.<br/>This gun will fire a\u00a0purple orb at your mouse cursor.
