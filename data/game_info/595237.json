You can check up on your POWER level on the green bar at the right of the screen! You slowly regenerate POWER over time, but don\u2019t get too compacent!\r\n</p>\r\nHEAT\r\n<p>BORING generates\u00a0<strong>HEAT</strong>. If your HEAT goes\u00a0<strong>CRITICAL</strong>, you\u2019ll be stopped dead on your tracks until you naturally cool down out of the DANGER zone on your themometer. Bore some CRYOPTASE to cool you down artificially some! Also, take into account the deeper down you go, the more the ambient heat will rise, upping the minimum temperature you\u2019ll be able to cool down to. And the deeper you go, the more heat you generate by BORING. Keep this in mind!\r\n</p>\r\nKNOW YOUR MATERIALS\r\n<p>There\u2019s four standard types of materials:\u00a0<strong>DIRT</strong>,\u00a0<strong>ROCK</strong>,\u00a0<strong>DURALITE</strong>, and\u00a0<strong>ADAMANTINE</strong>. DIRT takes one hit to break, and each subsequent type takes one more hit to break than the last. The deeper down you go, the more hard materials you\u2019ll find!</p>\n<p>Also, there\u2019s three special types of materials you can use for special effects:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>POWERENIUM</strong>\u00a0Grants you extra energy!</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>CRYOPTASE</strong>: Lowers your heat for 5 seconds!</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>TURBOGLYCERIN</strong>: Lowers the amount of hits blocks need to take to be broken by 1, for 5 seconds!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:00:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/93805504483f15023f1418ff6e10c57c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["perpetuaReality"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
