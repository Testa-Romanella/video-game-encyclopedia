Just watch out for those oncoming horses! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you want to collect some loot along your jogging route, we've got you covered. Coins and gems, and someday we'll have scrolls about lost arts. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow do I win? It's endless. You win when you're done chilling with the game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan I shoot or beat up bad guys? Oh nonono... none of that here. We just jogging along. Or walking. And running. <br/>\r\nAnd also sliding. Like, under obstacles. Oh yeah, and jumping over stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nJust run forward? Yeah, pretty much. You can also go sideways. As in left or right. In fact, it's recommended. And jumping way up and sliding under stuff, as was made clear a few the sentences ago.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-05T03:57:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b126801bacda83135c35e7ec1c081976.jpg", "website": "https://kotla.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kotla Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kotla Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
