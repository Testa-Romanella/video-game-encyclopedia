Roll up snowballs to the size you want them to be, and collect decorations along the way. Then take them back to the village and build your own snowmen in the village for all to see.</p>\n<p>Snowman Village tries to split the focus evenly between the game section (rolling snowballs) and the creative side (building your own crazy snowmen). Your village is automatically saved so you can come back to it and keep adding and expanding it. Take photos of your favorite creations and share them online!</p>\n<p>The game is controlled with the mouse \u2013 theres plenty of help instructions that pop up the first time you play, but if you want to see them again you can reset them in the options menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:08:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42de7b0917c42cf57b28c9fcf6dc5ec9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Triangular Pixels"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
