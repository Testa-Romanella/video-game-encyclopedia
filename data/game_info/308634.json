This game will have a ton of weird and crazy Easter Eggs\u00a0( Including a Cornfield with Furries doing a Ritual to summon a Demonic Furry from the\u00a0DeviantArt Hole of Hell ) Anyways putting the Easter Eggs aside the game is focused more on Open World crap and Player Choice. You take on the role of a robot with advanced AI so advanced you can make your own decisions. Planet Earth has in recent years been f*cking itself over so the Government decided to send a robot into Outer Space to find a new Planet with at least 75 % similarity to Earth. You travel to different planets and meet Aliens, People, Space Furries, and most importantly those creepy guys with the masks and their leader Kim Berry as the Green Guy with a Green Face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:05:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616bfd79389d08a133f2c6fe3cf304e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JustKiddingGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
