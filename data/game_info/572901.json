A cute, small roguelike inspired by Michael Brough's games and my first roguelike game ever! I used Jeremiah Reid's\u00a0Javascript Broughlike tutorial code as the foundation for my game.</p>\n<p>The Strawberry Earth Mother is appalled at the pests invading and destroying her garden and she has something to say about it. Much shuddering will occur.</p>\n<p>UPDATE FROM v1:</p>\n<p>Moles no longer destroy the Exit tile!</p>\n<p>Powers have been added, easing the difficulty level! Gather strawberries to gain more power! 3X = A\u00a0NEW POWER!</p><p>Audio volume has been tweaked.</p>\n<p>BUGS -</p>\n<p>The bird is supposed to steal your strawberries, currently it just flies around. It will eat them still if it hits the tile where they are.</p>\n<p>Any other bugs?\u00a0Let me know down in the comments!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:08:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/01445649105864a161bc56f426e96a3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Burnerknight Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
