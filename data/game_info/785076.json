It is true that this game's development was inspired by the game Vampire Survivors by poncle</p>\n<p>We wanted to see if we could make something similar, but different - to see if we could capture some of the fun elements of that game and then expand on them and see what kinds of challenges and/or obstacles such a project would create,\u00a0 and then overcome them.</p>\n<p>This game is not intended to be a copy, a rip-off, a reskin, or an attempt to trick people into buying this game instead of the other one. We have dedicated real time, energy, resources,\u00a0 and money into making this the best game we could make,\u00a0 and trying to come up with our own version.</p>\n<p>That being said, it is understandable and inevitable that we will be compared to that other game.</p>\n<p>We only hope that this comparison can be seen as the flattery that it is intended and not something nefarious.</p>\n<p>If you like this game, please consider supporting Vampire Survivors as well - and tell 'em Axol Studio says 'hi' \ud83d\ude09</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Code:</strong> Tim Hely</p>\n<p><strong>Design: </strong>Tim Hely\u00a0 &amp; Naomi Hely</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong>\u00a0Dorian Kavadlo</p>\n<p><strong>Title Illustration:</strong>\u00a0Mau Mora</p>\n<p><strong>Base Sprites </strong>by Oryx Design\u00a0Lab</p>\n\n\n\n\n<strong>\n<p>axolstudio.com</p>\n</strong>\n\n<p><strong>Made in\u00a0</strong><strong>HaxeFlixel</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T15:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f975f72e177f1d27afa9e1e0abd1d4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Axol Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
