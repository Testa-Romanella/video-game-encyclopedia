{"id": 529196, "slug": "hero-defense-battlefield-prototype", "name": "Hero Defense Battlefield - Prototype", "name_original": "Hero Defense Battlefield - Prototype", "description": "<p>Play as a Hero, and try to defend your city against enemies on this Hero Defense Battlefield prototype.<br/></p>\n<p>The main difference of this Hero Defense Game and many others around is it's approach to a Top-Down view and huge field of war. Commonly, Defense Games have a linear lane with many monsters going down a single road; but here you will have a big field with many monsters scattered around. This means that it include much more decision making than building the right things in the right places, and game-play-wise it feels much closer to a Hack'n Slash than to a Tower Defense.</p>\n<p>For gaming veterans:</p>\n<p>a) I want to make a Defense Game like Elona Shooter; b) where I can apply strategies of the \"Total War\" series; c) while playing as a MOBA hero; d) and with the replay potential of deckbuilding games.</p>\n<p>For more details:</p>\n<p>Fight as in a MOBA - Top Down, Control a Hero, use 4 Skills, dodge attacks, start from lvl 1 and evolve every play session (around 20-30 minutes) amassing skills, weapons, stats... only to start all over again. Fun!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Manage the fort as a RPG - Hero Defense, recruit allies, improve their weapons, skills, build towers, traps. Replay with different characters, and achieve new powers earned from the completion of the previous runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make tactics as a RTS - Enemies do not come in Waves. It is a tactical approach to defeat 1 Boss Invader, which uses skills and summon minions in a smart way, and can only be defeated by good tacticians. Unless you are playing Barbarian.</p>\n<p>Replay as a deckbuilding - After every session, you earn exp, and unlock new relics and characters which will let you have another complete different experience on your next run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Story-driven defense adventure - It is a story of survival of characters in a world with only one last hope.\u00a0 Each of them have their own past, present, and, if you protect them, a future.</p>\n<p>This game includes no words or dialogues. The game itself is a non-stop shooting fireballs everywhere. It has signs such as sparkling boxes for you to understand that you should interact with them, but everything else comes from you trying to understand the environment. The story comes from your understanding of what means to have one of your allies leaving your fort after you fail to protect someone, or a\u00a0meteor slowly approaching the world, or a banquet.</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<br/></p>\n<p>I am actually a solo developer, ex-hotel front staff, who never programmed, and is unemployed. I had some free time in the\u00a0last 1-2 months to make this game using a game making software which doesn't requires coding.<br/>Any donations for the game will be used to buy assets and keep me alive until I finish the main game.<br/>I am asking for support in other places, such as Kickstarter, but if I\u00a0am unable to make this a into full-time endeavor, I will still continue this as a hobby.</p>\n<p>If I receive enough backing, I would gladly instead buy professional help.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This is for now what I have thought about this project. Since I am a lone developer I am not hindered by anything (but my abilities, budget and software), so if you have any good Idea to give me I would love to hear from you. I will be checking the page commentaries whenever possible.</p>\n<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p>Legal:<br/></p>\n<p>Made with Pixel Game Maker \u00a92018 KADOKAWA CORPORATION<br/>All assets used are either mine or came with the Pixel Game Maker.<br/>Free Icons from https://game-icons.net/lorc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:26:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f20/f20a0d924bd1ad720c7efb7eadb111b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnderwayGaming"], "genres": ["Shooter", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
