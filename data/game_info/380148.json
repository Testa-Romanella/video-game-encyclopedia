{"id": 380148, "slug": "ore-maze", "name": "Ore Maze", "name_original": "Ore Maze", "description": "<p>When I was a child, I liked to play the ranch town of ore and the incredible maze. Every time I entered the game, I had different experiences. Combining the advantages of these games together, it must be interesting and exciting.</p>\n<p>Simply put, every time you enter the maze, it will be different.</p>\n<p>* I am just a novice independent developer, so this game will definitely have a BUG. If you find it, please let me know, I will try to fix it, but I can't guarantee it~</p>\n<p>A classic nostalgic style of survival single player, if you die, everything will come back.</p>\n<p>If you are adventurous, you can choose the one that suits you best and break through the bottom of this ore maze! Just like the ore town that was played that year, you used your limited physical strength to dig up to 255 layers. Of course, no one in the ore labyrinth can discover so many layers! In addition, if you don't like career, then continue to be your unemployed!</p>\n<p>At the same time, you can also dig back and forth for sale of ore to merchants in exchange for wealth, so that you can leave this island, but this island ticket will be bought for you so easily? Never, this ticket is like the price of Hong Kong, 4 million is only the most basic admission fee, and this is your other goal.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7a14338956f77521ad24d9e6ff3ffd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["siuleeboss"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
