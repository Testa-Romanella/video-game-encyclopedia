You have to collect even points to pass the level, collect 300 points and you pass. However, beware of rodents and birds that may stop you from being able to collect your produce.</p>\n<p>Rules: 1. Apples give you +100 points 2. Corn gives you +350 points 3. If a seed attack hits the enemy, then the enemy will be stunned, this makes it so that you can use the frozen enemy to help traverse level 4. Shooting seeds subtract -50 points from your score.</p>\n<p>Controls: Move: W(Up/Jump), A(Left), D(Right); Shoot: Spacebar; Restart: Escape</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T20:36:10", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DevCoolBeans"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
