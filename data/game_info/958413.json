This camera is the only way to see it. It's determined to find you, it lurks in the dark.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nUse Your Tools\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Your only tool is your camera. It's old and bulky, but it'll protect you if you know how to use it. It's your only source of light. But, don't trust anything you see or hear.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is short,\u00a0 ambient and creepy. I made this game in a week to test my coding skills and make something short and fun.</p>\n<p>The game features 2 slightly different alternate endings.</p>\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nI hope you enjoy the game!\r\nPlease consider supporting me by rating the game or joining any of my communities, any bit of support means a lot to me! &lt;3\r\nDiscord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/PUar2zETx6\r\nSubreddit:\u00a0https://www.reddit.com/r/arrowheadincident/\r\n<p><em>All intellectual rights reserved.\u00a0</em><em>Asset creators have been credited within the game's credits.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-20T03:11:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf4/cf42f26a4e28819875978fb2e484bba8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikk F"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
