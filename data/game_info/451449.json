You're a lowly Janitor in charge of cleaning up the magic clock that controls time. But oh no! It broke, and all of time and space is shattered and falling apart! It's up to you to navigate what's left of the world and find all the broken pieces, which have been spread out across different periods of time. (Don't judge this too harshly, we made it just for fun.)</p>\n<p>Link to project source files:\u00a0https://github.com/WilliamStarling/TimeJanitor\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half the credit goes to my friend A Gbro, we both worked equally hard on this.\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLw6kJDw8g2eDd2oAFQ66g</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a92aa8a05af51ea7ceadee61c5ad0c47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WilliamStarling"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
