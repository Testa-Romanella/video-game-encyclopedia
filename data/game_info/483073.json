Lucky for Frank, the curse makes him freakishly strong, and he grows even stronger by absorbing the energy of his foes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You control Frank and use his spin attack to destroy enemies and the environment. You continuously grow bigger and can destroy even more of the environment as you progress.</p>\n<p>Can you destroy the wizard and restore Frank to his normal self?</p>\n<p>This is my first game (outside of projects for an online Unity\u00a0course I took), and is a submission for the Miz Game Jam 1 (https://itch.io/jam/miz-jam-1). There is a TON I'd love to have added/fixed before submitting\u00a0but sadly could not - I suppose that's how it goes w/ Game Jams. Maybe if people enjoy it I'll give it a bit more love afterwards.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa1c63efa7a93c9958cf7dbf68b60de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chris Staikos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
