{"id": 723702, "slug": "tower-types", "name": "Tower Types", "name_original": "Tower Types", "description": "<p>This is a tower defense game in which your tower selections and placements are critical for success. Towers target the closest enemy so be careful with placement otherwise enemies may evade your towers. There are 5 different tower types all with unique stats to manage as you build up your defenses</p>\n<p><strong>Some gameplay notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Towers are not moveable once they are placed</p>\n<p>Towers target the closest enemy</p>\n<p>There are two difficulties (Easy and Hard). You can select your difficulty in the\u00a0 \u00a0 options menu from the main menu</p>\n<p>There is a mute button for the audio (Also in the options menu but also in game)</p>\n<p>There is no autosave so if you go back to the menu you will restart on round 1. There are 10 rounds that can go by somewhat quick if you play well though so losing a round or 2 shouldn't take more than a few minutes to catch back up</p>\n<p>There is a final boss on round 10 of hard mode that can be somewhat challenging</p>\n<p>Try many different strategies out when playing to find the best results. I put a great deal of effort into balancing the gameplay and the towers</p>\n<p><strong>Development Note</strong></p>\n<p>At the beginning of development the game was a college project\u00a0based on a tower defense tutorial by Brackeyes\u00a0(YouTube linked below). However, I went back and changed a bunch of it to make the game how I\u00a0wanted. I\u00a0would recommend anyone to check it out if you are interested in creating your own tower defense game in Unity</p>\n<p>If you have any comments or questions feel free to provide input. While I\u00a0have made a few small games this is my first game that I\u00a0am releasing and would love any feedback that you may want to share\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559dc72492fa7250835e108621bdde27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JordanPaugh"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
