Updated Level 2 to be more challenging. I also added random enemies extra health (up to 5) so some enemies are able to take more damage. Also added more enemy and modified the requirement of completing the level harder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Added the last level 3. Since it is the final stage of the game, I added the different types of enemies (Shooter that follows the player, with 2 extra lazer) and multiple enemies. Also modified is that to complete the final stage, the player must kill every enemy with no hit. The Player has one life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Added the instruction.
