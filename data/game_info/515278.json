Bubba was feeding the brothers pet alligators Beans and Gumbo. Dale was loading his shotgun with scrap as he so often did. There was a misfire and an 8-bit processor got lodged in Bubbas brain. Bubba was rushed to the hospital, and seemed to be in a stable condition. They were however not able to remove the processor. It is important to understand that before the accident Bubba was dumb as mud, but he seemed to have gained an inexplicable ability and drive to program video games. So the boys built a computer huddled together from scrap and set to develop their masterpiece Beans and Gumbo.</p>\n<p>The game was inspired by games like Donkey Kong and other arcade classics of the time. As well as their alligators love for junk-food.<br/>The game was a smash hit in their home state of Louisiana and the brothers saw great success, but tragedy struck when they crashed their car in a tree shortly after the release of the game. With only three machines out there, it was long thought that the game was lost forever. We know that the first machine was flooded in a hurricane, the second was smashed by a disgruntled teen and the third was assumed destroyed.</p>\n<p>In 2013 it was found in a barn dusty and decrepit. To everyones surprise the game booted. So it was sent to experts at Bayou Brothers in Norway that after 6 years managed to port the game to a playable version. Some things were corrupted and certain modifications had to be made. The first rule was still that the game had to be as close to its original arcade game.</p>\n<p>The remade version is the one that you see in front of you today. So enjoy what has been dubbed \u00abThe Donkey Kong of the South\u00bb and experience the greatest game that was almost lost to time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T03:16:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a86aff3d28cf60dec2050e8409ecd8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bayou Bros"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
