Instead of dashing and wall-jumping, you\u2019ll run, flap, float, and inhale your way up the mountain. A spring breeze is blowing flower petals across the slopes.\u00a0Collect optional Maximum Tomatoes, just for fun. We made minimal edits to <em>Celeste</em>\u2019s level designs to allow for 100% completion.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys: Walk, Fly, and Crouch</li><li>Z: Jump / Flap</li><li>X: Inhale / Exhale</li></ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve played <em>Celeste</em>, you know that part of its story is about overcoming anxiety and realizing that anybody, with enough determination and the right tools, can climb the mountain. (If you\u00a0<em>haven't</em> played Celeste, go buy it!)\u00a0The scene with the feather and the breathing exercise is so memorable! Madeline\u2019s journey to work with herself, rather than against herself, has meant a lot to us. The generous Assist Mode shows us there's no wrong way to make it, and that it's cool to play games in whatever way you like.</p>\n<p>This mod asks\u00a0<em>and answers</em>\u00a0the question: what if a friendly pink balloon with shoes climbed Celeste Mountain?<br/></p>\n<p>This is an idea that started as a joke during Episode 46 of You\u2019re Too Show, a podcast where we look for depth and hilarity in kids' media. We\u2019ve been talking about <em>Kirby: Right Back At Ya!</em> and were struck by a scene in which Kirby falls asleep while fighting. Metaknight says that Kirby\u2019s freedom from anxiety is his greatest strength. We were like, \u201cWhoa! That reminds me of the feather scene in Celeste. Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026?\u201d And then we realized it was actually a cute and thematic idea, and put it together over a few weeks as a side project.</p>\n<p>Follow <strong>EX.ULT VIDEOTAINMENT</strong> here on Itch or on Twitter\u00a0@EXULTgames\u00a0to see more cute game things we\u2019re working on!</p>\r\nMod Credits:\r\n<ul><li>Nick Splendorr: Design &amp; Code - @nosplendorr</li><li>Ryan Splendorr: Art &amp; Animation - @resplendorr</li><li>Jacob Regus: Musical Arrangements</li><li>We gratefully include a\u00a0modified version of @trianull\u2019s Pico-8 cover of \u201cGreen Greens\u201d: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=60633</li></ul>\r\nSpecial thanks to:\r\n<ul><li>Caleb Zane Huett for help with the concept and play testing.</li><li>Lucy Ralston and Tony Ransom for feedback and code help.</li><li>All our friends in C.A.F.E. for encouragement and feedback.</li><li>The Celeste team for making such a great game.
