There are a total of three Diamonds: Red, Green and Blue. The Diamond you pick will determine your fate.\u00a0Throughout the various platforms, you'll see books lying around containing clues that will help you chose the right Diamond. You only have 1 life in this game, so once you get into the Diamond Room, chose wisely. Good luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're familiar with Pokemon, yes, this game is indeed inspired by Saffron City Gym. Sadly you won't be seeing Sabrina here.</p>\n<p><strong>Gitlab Link:</strong>\u00a0https://gitlab.com/nixisendya/gamejam-csui2019</p>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>\n<p>Tileset</p>\n<p>Character &amp; Tiles</p>\n<p>Book\u00a0Icon</p>\n<p>Music - Title Screen</p>\n<p>Music - Game</p>\n<p>Music - Win</p>\n<p>Music - Lose</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:40:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b4112d1c3f86aa11735a2010c4d25e33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nixisendya"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
