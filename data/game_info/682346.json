The video data seems to show a brand new Alienware X39 Gaming Laptop using the Alienware Liquid Cooling solution.\n\nWhen we saw this video we were interested to meet the brand new Alienware X39 Extreme Edition model and find out why it is using liquid cooling. What we found out is that the CPU is running at 2120 MHz Core Clock, and working at a 40\u00b0C low power.\n\nThe CPU is at about 35% of the current clock, and the clockspeed is up to 1200 MHz, which is rather insane. This is the case for any high end laptop, and indeed the Alienware X39 Extreme Edition has a Core Clock of 1050 MHz. Processor performance is up to higher than average, as you can see from the video.\n\nThe video shows the chassis, which looks exactly the same as what we can see with the Alienware X61 gaming laptop.\n\n\nAccording to the Alienware website, the X39 Extreme Edition was designed in response to the demand in current market performance models. It offers \"up to, and beyond our hopes coming out of the upcoming market, the latest mid-range design and components\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T08:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e26/e260455dd76d50fb9f89daf29895cc1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
