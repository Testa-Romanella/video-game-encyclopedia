The postal office tried rolling out a new aerial delivery system but that failed. Everyone's packages are all over towns and it's up to you, an old delivery robot, to collect them <br/>and deliver them to the right address!<br/><br/>Postal Delivery is my first public game made in Unreal Engine. With this project I intend to enroll for Breda University for the course Creative Media &amp; Games Technologies. I'd highly prefer if you could record your game play footage and post links to it in the comments. But if you can't record foot there's a GForm inquiry for you to fill out. I don't like this method but it's the easiest way to gather feedback.</p><p>https://forms.gle/xzSr43WWH1NjeVZR8<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>S.
