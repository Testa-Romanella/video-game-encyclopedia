This tool allows you to drop in props from a library of hundreds of items. Stage designers can also simulate actually running through the stage with support for real physics based mechanisms like swingers, drop turners, texas stars and more. When you're done with the stage designs, you can export them into match ready written stage briefing documents in PDF format.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T05:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b208ccb536ccbbbd3162e9cd88ba48a.jpg", "website": "https://www.ancientskygames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AncientSky Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["AncientSky Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
