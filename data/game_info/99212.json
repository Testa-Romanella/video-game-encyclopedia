The 'AfterLD38' download contains improvements I've made after the close of LudumDare38. If you're planning to rate this game for LD38, please use the original downloads to be fair to other Ludum Dare entries. Thanks!<br/></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>What's New in the After LD Build?<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Improved camera and navigation controls based on feedback from Ludum Dare players. Planet-side camera rotation should be more natural, and using the jetpack in space will now fly you towards where your are looking, simplifying interplanetary navigation.</li><li>Fixed a bug that kept the games 'success' sounds from playing when you gained a piece, dropped it off at the rocket, or won the game.</li><li>Fixed one source of odd camera transitions when leaving planets.</li><li>Improved atmospheric rendering.</li><li>Increased amount to ambient light present on the dark side of planets.</li><li>Fixed transparency of intro text panel.</li><li>Added map of where rocket parts can be found, it will pop up when you move near the rocket ship.</li><li>Added a short end-game cutscene. I may expand it and add sound in a future update.</li><li>Improved roll maneuverability while flying with the jetpack in space.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100df8608d1e43586850b1d4e506028e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Endless Plumber Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
