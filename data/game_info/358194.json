(It is far from your usual bug eating plant ;)<br/>Information: We dare say that the music on this game is a piece of art in this game so make sure to have earphones on while playing. <br/><br/># Prologue<br/>The player's character is the master of a dungeon in a far-flung corner of nowhere. For him having to fend off the warriors who keep coming over to thieve items and treasures is a real pain.<br/>One day, he gets himself a little plant in order to help him relax. However, as the plant grows our guy starts to get the feeling that he got more than what he bargained for.<br/><br/># Features<br/>1. Cute graphics - pixel graphics composed pixel by pixel 100% manually.<br/>2. Satisfying scream sound - There is a unique scream (?) for individual feed.<br/>3. Different kinds of feed - There are about 30 different kinds of prey, so have fun discovering them one by one.<br/>4. The next stage of the evolution of plant - As the plant grows, various body parts (?) evolve which might give you something to chuckle about.<br/>5. The pets from the other dimension- pets that have sold their souls (?) in the other world will collect coins for you.<br/><br/># How to play<br/>1. Water the pot and let it sprout.<br/>2. Once it grows a head, I try to feed it a slime.<br/>3. After eating, the plant spits out the treasure the prey possessed.<br/>4. Gather the things you spit out and feed them better.<br/>5. Keep feeding the plant and watch it evolve.<br/><br/># Precautions before deleting the game<br/>Please note that when the game is deleted from the device, saved data is also deleted.
