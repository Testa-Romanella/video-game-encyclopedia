Although it is very easy, it is quite laborious, and I want the player to be able to do something while they get to the next letter. It could be boring, but this is that type of genre, the waiting. <br/>Anyways have fun and check the announcements for any more updates!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94a02b6b049813eb2d4c03b9e6157a52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnderShi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AnderShi"], "esrb_rating": null}
