Consequently, the walls are transparent, hence the name. <br/>Movement is fast, death is fast, ammo is short. Thrown weapons will stun<br/> enemies, just like in HM.</p>\n<p>Right-click Picks up/throws. Left-click shoots (when you have a weapon.)<br/> Esc for sensitivity. Each weapon model shows the amount of shots left <br/>in actual geometry. If enemy falls out of level (RARE) press f6 to skip <br/>level.</p>\n<p><strong>the fuzzy games dev team</strong><br/>hjaarnio - art assets<br/>Teh_Bucket - art and code<br/>Souler - character concept<br/>fried - music</p>\n<p>We'll be continuing to develop this after the 7dfps, we've got a <br/>musician working on a longer soundtrack, will improve ai, add new enemy <br/>types, level interaction and more levels, and possible make co-op.</p>\n<p>Tools used: Blender, Unity (free version), sfxr</p>\n<p>Linux build is compiled in windows, so you'll have to set the run file <br/>to executable yourself.\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74b360e579d4c71d5d43faf9234f7da8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Teh_Bucket"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
