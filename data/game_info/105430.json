And now finally the answer to all these questions is here.</p>\n<p>\"Rose-Coloured Dungeon Life\", a game that has you romancing monsters instead of killing them. (We mean that. No killing monsters neccessary.)<br/>Instead you slaughter humans (they deserve it), get to know up to four unique partners (could it be there is a secret fifth one? naaaah.) and save the dungeon.<br/>We know you love to be the knight in shining armor. (Though you may die some times. Use WaifuMode for more waifu and less shining.)</p>\n\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\r\nW, A, S, DMovement<br/>\r\nJ, K, LPaw attack, Tail attack, DashW, SSelect text optionEInteractEsc\u00a0Open / Close options<br/>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\r\nCEO, ProgrammingJunberGraphicsSturo\u00a0and\u00a0CFallonartDesign, MarketingHisfantorStory, DesignBelphegor and FeatherwingedMusicSteamdragon\r\n<p><strong>Have fun, lowercase_games</strong>\r\nTwitter\u00a0Reddit\u00a0Instagram\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6bdc568a5c69418408fea24f324d7d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["lowercase_games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
