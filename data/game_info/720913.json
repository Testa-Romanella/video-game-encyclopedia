What exactly did she do, and how on Earth do you stop it?</p>\n<p>Warnings: Language (will add more when applicable)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>The Romantic Interests</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><em>Mark Verlice.</em></p>\n<p>Your sweet and soft-spoken therapist, and someone you've known for seven years now. He's reliable and easy to talk to, but he seems to have a lot going under the surface.</p>\n\n<p><em>Celaine Shafer.</em></p>\n<p>Your childhood best friend. She's energetic and always ready to help, and her lack of a filter just makes her even funnier to be around. She would do anything for you.</p>\n\n<p><em>Antonio Garrido.</em></p>\n<p>A friend of Mark's. He's a man of few words and has a \"stick up his ass,\" according to Celaine, but he's a helpful ally. Almost everything he does is carefully calculated, maybe that's something you need to fix.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nadia Moon.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Antonio's right-hand-woman.
