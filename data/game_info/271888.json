It's a hybrid between a game with a rising lava pit and a bullet hell game. It runs on Windows and was developed in C# and .NET Framework 4.7.1 .<br/><br/>You guide an explorer, Jo Whitstilmacenstein, who is exploring the inside of a volcano with a protective heat suit when he hears rumbling noises all around him. Pools of lava begin to appear at his feet, and he knows he has to get out as soon as possible.<br/><br/>In the end there were lots of little things left unfinished and very little time to do it so I just focused on making the game playable. There are four levels in total.<br/><br/>Use the left and right arrow keys and space to jump, or the W A D keys. F12 will get you into a barely functional level editor - you can edit the level with the mouse (left to place tiles, right to destroy them, click on an existing tile to change its type). You can still die, but the lava stops rising in the level editor. F1 to save the level to a file (overwrites the existing level in slot 1, 2, 3 or 4).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba14fbd2fc6e9ca1aacbbaad3a459ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChosenPotato"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
