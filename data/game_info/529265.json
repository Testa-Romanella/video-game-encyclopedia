You wake up the next morning in a dark forest, not knowing what will happen. However, Congress doesn't appear as it once was...</p>\n<p>This game was heavily inspired by Slender: The Eight Pages, however, you can't pick up the papers in Congress Man compared to Slender due to lack of knowledge and time. You must follow the open path that is in front of you when the game begins, otherwise, you'll get lost and the game won't end.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0created this game for a project in high school. Due to procrastination, I pushed the development of my full game down to\u00a0a measily few hours over a span of 3 days. However, I was able to get a extremely rough foundation of the game down before the deadline.\u00a0 Nonetheless, I\u00a0felt like sharing my first game even with lack of content that it doesn't provide because it's the first time I ever messed around with Unity on my own accord which I'm proud of in itself.</p>\n<p>For clarification, the game is supposed to automatically close and exit after the specific event.\u00a0I hope you enjoy what I was able to bring together in such a short time span.\u00a0 Thank you for reading :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:43:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b00c9c1ceab976971eee579603ba5bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thinhh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
