This game does not favor passive builds, and will require you to stay on your toes, weaving through enemies and incoming attacks, while collecting resources and upgrades when and where you can. Modify your runs with limited elements of roguelite progression.<br/><br/><br/>A gauntlet of Bullet Hell bosses will test both your defenses and offenses. These high-octane, punishing battles are be driven by a pulse-pounding, glitchcore soundtrack from Milkypossum.<br/><br/><br/>Immerse yourself in a psychedelic atmosphere, filled with secrets, that will keep you guessing at every turn. The more you think you know of the story, the more layers you'll find to peel back. The story elements are largely option, but will provide depth and context for players who wish to explore every corner of Picayune Dreams.<h3>Inspirations</h3>Taking inspiration from a varied collection of our favourite games: <strong>Vampire Survivors</strong> (roguelike horde survival), <strong>Touhou</strong> (true bullet hell), <strong>Yume Nikki</strong> (surrealist visual stylings and secrets), and <strong>Diablo</strong> (power scaling and item visualization).<br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088840/Picayune_Dreams/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T00:50:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b81/b81e9eb4977e014bbeddc6232ffad5f3.jpg", "website": "https://2leftthumbs.manakeep.com/picayune-dreams", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 20, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stepford", "andyland", "milkypossum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["2 Left Thumbs"], "esrb_rating": null}
