Your evil mother and pseudo-god, Erobdath, has taken over the cosmos in your absence. Having been confined for millions of years in your four-dimensional prison, you are broken free and cast down to the Earth. However, the world you find yourself on is in complete disarray. After some cataclysmic event, most of humanity is dead. And two paramilitary organizations fight over scarce resources: Tilded-Nu and the EDP. As the war between these two factions rages on, you must navigate this apocalyptic hellscape in order to achieve your goal. By all means necessary, you seek to transform into your most powerful iteration. So you may return to your homeworld, kill your mother, and reclaim your throne. But on your journey, you will realize that your true goal is to help save this planet.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Erobdista is yet another one of my weird games\u00a0that aims to create a bizarre multigenre experience. This is primarily a top-down exploration game that's all about seeing and doing cool things in cool places. With 20 different levels, over 30 minutes of cinematic slideshow cutscenes, and a plethora of heart-touching, royalty-free music under its belt, this game will truly give players an unforgettable experience.</p>\r\nErobdista is by no means a serious game. It is meant to be comical\u00a0and absolutely over the top! I made this game for fun, and because I wanted to finally close this crappy chapter of my life. I do not directly take credit for this game's story. \u00a0That would go to my uh... friend, Urania Experiment. Also, this game is rated \"mature\" for a reason, it is DEFINITELY not appropriate for younger audiences.<br/>\n<p>Lastly, to anyone confused as to why this is tagged \"fnaf\", well... let's just say this game is connected to all of my previous games.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6f/a6f5a2056a2e07aaeb86fdc9e522c9bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frigid_Mouse"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
