You can see if you have still have it in your top-left corner of the screen.</p>\n<p>This is not an endless thing, there is ending, although please do not expect anything fenomenal at the end. I had really limited amount of time and I had just about 2-3hrs per day for this, so I kept it really simple as I wasn' t sure how much I can pull off at the end. This is why the game lacks basically any graphics and it contains just few coloured circles and rectangles, but despite that I hope that the experience will be some-what challenging and CHAOTIC.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the chaos, leave a feedback or a comment if you feel like it, enjoy your day and thank you so much for your time, with my game.</p>\n<p>Jin</p>\n<p>The game has been created during Brackeys Game Jam with a theme: \"Let there be chaos\".\u00a0Tools used:</p>\n<p>- Unity</p>\n<p>- FL Studio</p>\n<p>- Audacity</p>\n<p>- Photoshop</p>\n<p>- Pen &amp; Paper</p>\n<p>- Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T21:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae7ac5c550e9f396eb540e26cdec8bc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jin9310"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
