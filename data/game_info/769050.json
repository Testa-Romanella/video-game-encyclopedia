Being  the runt of the litter was not easy, but our protagonist grew up happily  like his other, taller siblings. This did not last for long.  Complications with the operation of the ram ranch convinced the owners  that they needed to donate one of their rams to a local genetic  experiment. \r\nThis is where your story begins.\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0The  story of this game is entirely up to you. Over the course of the game,  you will be presented with a series of opportunities to do good, bad or neither. Doing so affects the overall path that your character takes, and thus the outcome of the story.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>All of this will take place over three chapters of the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Gameplay.</strong></p>\n<p>The game consists of two main parts: The overworld and Combat.\r\nLike  most RPGs, you will spend a good deal of your time exploring the  overworld in search for items and quests, some of which will contribute to\u00a0\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The  combat phases are closely related to the overworld in that the  perspective doesn't change and it takes place in real time. To be  effective in combat, you must make use of your surroundings while  observing your enemy's attack patterns to determine the best course of  action.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the path of your character,  you will be granted special abilities and stats that will greatly aid  you in combat, but will also change how enemies approach you.<br/></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Arts.</strong></p>\n<p>The direction of the art style in this game was heavily inspired by Undertale!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The  soundtrack for the game is produced by DJ ESKIMO, who created the  soundtrack for Billy Gunslinger! Many of the songs feature soft piano  melodies and upbeat banjo strums that inspire the player to keep moving  forward!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The official soundtrack for Chapter 1 is now available on Bandcamp, iTunes, Spotify and YouTube!<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>\u00a0Listen on Bandcamp!\r\n</li><li> \u00a0Listen on iTunes!\r\n\r\n</li><li> Listen on Spotify!<br/></li></ul>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The First Chapter<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The first\u00a0part\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0is\u00a0free\u00a0to\u00a0download\u00a0right\u00a0now!\u00a0\r\n   Information on the other chapters will be shared in the future!\r\n      </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This game includes content and language that may not be suitable for young lambs.    \r\n<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T10:54:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72c/72cc052b59dc5148588f22c7e251f0d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dingo Goes Bingo Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
