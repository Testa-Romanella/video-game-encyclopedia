The theme of the jam was \"Lost &amp; Found\". We added the diversifier \"Starlight\u00a0:\u00a0Your game world is inspired by stars and constellations\".</p>\n<p>This was a first for some members of the team but It went great and we find the result quite good. This version of the game is a bit different from the one we send during the jam, we made some adjustments on the menus, sensibility and other small tweaks and improvements.</p>\n<p>Link to the GGJ game page :\u00a0Asteria</p><p>Link to the github repository :\u00a0Asteria</p>\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<ul><li>Escape : Pause the\u00a0game</li><li>Ctrl : Show the constellations\u00a0to find</li><li>ZQSD : Move the character</li><li>Space : Jump</li><li>Right Clic : Zoom</li></ul>\n<p>This game was made by:</p>\n<ul><li>KALITA Milo (3D artist)</li><li>LOURTIES Thomas (Game / Level Designer)</li><li>PELLOUX Romain (Composer / Sound Designer)</li><li>HEZON Romain (Composer / Sound Designer)</li><li>COLIN Simon (Developer)</li><li>PACAUD BOEHM Corentin (Developer)</li><li>DUMARTIN Lucas (Developer)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:07:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b7450f8dd3b716bc52af85033e11a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corentin PB"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
