But ever since the release of \"AUZG\" nothing has changed. I am planning on ending it all, this game prevented my incoming demise for a few weeks but now the voices are getting to me and I cannot go on while knowing the terrible acts I have committed (read the bible its a long story). thank you LARGEUZIVERT for letting me get a shitty demo version of \"AUZG\".\"\r\n<strong>Lord Finnigus The Great\u00a0(naughty corner games representative ) </strong>- \"Untitled Zombie Game is one of the most ambitious and influential games of this generation and deserves more praise.
