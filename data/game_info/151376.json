Be aware that at its current state this is a very barebones product and if you choose to purchase it you are aware of this, support for the \"MicroGame\" series will result in future updates for these games and make them more fleshed out. At its current state \"Buns with Guns\" only contains the very basic core game mechanics that will be prevalent in all versions of the game. Buying into the CORE version of any of our games will give you permanent access to all future iterations of that game.</strong></p><p>Buns with Guns : Core is the first version of<br/>the game released to the public and is also part<br/>of the NFWG MicroGame series. The game is extremely<br/>bare bones as it is in the core state as of this<br/>README but with further support for this game we<br/>are planning on updating everything within the game<br/>(Visuals, features, sound etc). As with any of the<br/>other games in our MicroGame series this is entirely<br/>driven by the players and more support (Both vocally<br/>and financially) will mean a bigger and better game<br/><br/></p><p>experience in the future. The game is a simple side-scrolling shooter and in it's current CORE state it only contains very bare-bones assets (Two types of upgrades, one type of enemy. Will be expanded upon further!)</p><p>NOTE : Purchasing any game in the NFWG MicroGames series will give you access to all future redesigns and updates AT NO COST (I.e When Buns with Guns reaches a certain goal in development and we decide to roll out \"Buns with Guns Mega\" any owners of Buns with Guns Core will be given the next iteration of the game)</p><p>The NFWG MicroGame series is a growing collection of<br/>small simple arcade-like games that start out as<br/>very small simple games but are planned to become<br/>bigger and grow in scope depending on how they are<br/>received by the public. The MicroGame series was<br/>started primarily as a fun project to further<br/>our game development skills as well as publishing<br/>games in general. The Microgames series as well is set to be very cheap, cheaply produced games for a very cheap price and we aim to stay cheap in price forever, it's the perfect type of game to play in the background of doing something else (Like listening to a podcast or YouTube video) or perhaps you'd just like to get the highest possible score?</p><p>Hopefully you'll enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bf/1bf9b26e1a178737185d8d4ad4d584e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["No WiFi Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
