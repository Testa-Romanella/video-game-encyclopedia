The randomness of the totems in your \u2018hand\u2019, the changing colors of the territories, the variety of the maps, and the cleverness of your opponents will all conspire to make each turn a fun and interesting challenge. <br/><br/>The object of the game is to place carved animal pieces (totems) on the map in order to claim territories. Each turn you will place matching totems on adjacent territories to expand your control of the map. The player who conquers the most territories when the map is full, wins. A game of Totems can be finished super-quickly or slowly, depending on your skills and your approach. <br/><br/>GAME FEATURES <br/><br/>===&gt; Offline and Online Game Modes <br/>Match wits against computer-controlled characters.
