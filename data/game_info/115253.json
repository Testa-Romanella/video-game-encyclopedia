{"id": 115253, "slug": "steel-revolution", "name": "Steel Revolution", "name_original": "Steel Revolution", "description": "<p>Steel revolution is a top-down tactical shooter where you control a robot in a post-apocalyptic city. Unlike a regular shooter, tactics revolve around finding your enemy before they find you. You can hide behind buildings but so can your enemy. Fortunately, you have a range of devices at your disposal including a variety of probes to find enemies as well as devices to hide you from their view (smoke grenades) and escape their fire (countermeasure flares) .</p>\n<p>Your unit can also be upgraded with a range of weapons that function very differently. As enemies are typically discovered behind buildings you'll need to shoot over buildings with mortars, around them with guided missiles or even through them with rail guns to hit your target. Other tactical weapons are utilities are available included electromagnetic pulses, proximity mines and repair drones.</p>\n<p>All the buildings are fully destructible, being modelled using the Unity physics engine. The single player campaign involves a number of mission types including base assault, escort, and espionage roles.</p>\n\n<p>Credits - Music:</p>\n<p>\"Black Vortex\", \"Chee Zee Caves V2\", \"Constance\", \"Crypto\", \"Hitman\", \"Industrial Cinematic\", \"Invariance\", \"Killers\", \"Phantom from Space\", \"River of Io\"<br/>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Credits - Sounds:</p>\n<p>Mike Koenig (SoundBible.com), Caroline Ford (SoundBible.com), Diode111 (www.flashkit.com), Ivan (www.flashkit.com), eRco Inc.
