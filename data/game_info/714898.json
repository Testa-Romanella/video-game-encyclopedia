Near the end of the level, collect various bonus blocks while falling towards the finish line. You can gain extra points by leveling up, which increases the size of the spinning top. With each level, you'll break through glass barriers that add to your star rating. Find optimal paths to increase your chances of getting all five stars.<br/><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>- Swipe your finger left and right to dodge obstacles and collect tokens.<br/>- During the bonus phase, drag the spinning top around to earn extra points.<br/>- Watch out for non-matching colors. If the score on the spinning top falls to zero, the play session ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb2ed0fb1313f8415590c239d8afcc39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Revel Notion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
