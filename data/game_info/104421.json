Besides last hit training, we plan on adding other training modes such as: target prioritization order training, skillshot dodging training, implement various heroes with skills (the traditional QWER skills mobas have), and implement cool ideas coming from the community!</p>\n<p>We plan on incorporating all those within the same playing session, so you have to CS, then at certain points within the game dodge skillshots from bosses you summoned, receive temporary buffs and/or rewards from them and more.<br/>Unlike your typical online mobas, we plan on allowing the players to play offline, and we also plan on focusing more on skill training, even though we will gameify it to be more fun than just playing the practice tools/custom games of those respective mobas.</p>\n<p>Think single player campaign with a healthy degree of difficulty.</p><p>Feel free to open a thread in the Community section lower on this page, and offer your suggestions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a92/a925df6bdbd3f708b3dec25ec0b1e146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zadirion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
