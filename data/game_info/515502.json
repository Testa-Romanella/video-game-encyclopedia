The original inspiration came from the\u00a0\"Speeder\u00a0Bikes\"\u00a0in <em>Star Wars</em>\u2014I\u00a0wondered how you would actually control them while riding. After getting a quick proof of concept up and running, I\u00a0pulled inspiration from the <em>Jet Moto</em> series. The result is something that feels quite unique!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Currently, you need an Xbox\u00a0controller to play. The left joystick controls the left engine and the right joystick controls the right\u2014tilt both up to go forward. Similarly, the left and right\u00a0triggers control left and right\u00a0turbo thrusters. Right now there are two test scenes with no real objective... just play around and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:02:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brandon Cluff"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
