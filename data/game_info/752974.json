The whole fleet is wrecked. Get to the  teleporter and hope you end up in a working ship, or a ship with a  long-range teleporter to get home.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Most items have more than one function. An Electric Door can be  opened with an Emergency Generator, or by spending several batteries,  which you might want to save to keep your spacesuit working, or load  into a Zapper to destroy robots.  Do you have time to go the long way  around and hope to find more resources, or will you use a rare Bomb to  go through the wall and straight to the Teleporter?.\r\n</p>\n<p>I emphasized navigation and resource management over combat. Each door has multiple ways to get past, and most items have multiple uses, so you should always have some interesting decisions to make. <br/></p>\n<p>uses ROT.js by Ondrej Zara, used under BSD license.<br/></p>\n<p>https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T09:31:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b8/2b80a0156672eb5611cc61fff49c2b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cliffordius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
