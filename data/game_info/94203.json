As the manager of a little doggy daycare, you have to take care of your client\u2019s dogs and keep them fed, happy and clean until their owners come back for them! Dream job, you say? Wait until those little puppers start to grow in number!</p>\n<p>This game was developed in 72h for <strong>LUDUMDARE #41</strong>.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD: Move</li><li>Left Click: Shoot / Interact (only in the jam version)</li><li>E: Interact (only in the post-jam version)</li><li>Mouse Wheel: Alternate between Treat Gun and Watergun</li><li>G: Throw ball</li></ul>\n\r\nSOME EXTRA HELP\r\n<p>From time to time you\u2019ll receive a <strong>phone call</strong> from a person that needs your services as a dog carer. You better answer it fast, or it\u2019ll affect your <strong>reputation</strong>!</p>\n<p>Basically owners expect <strong>three things</strong> when they come back for their pets: they shouldn\u2019t be <strong>hungry</strong>, they shouldn\u2019t be <strong>dirty </strong>and they shouldn\u2019t be <strong>sad</strong>.</p>\n<p>The pets themselves will warn you when they are in need of any of those needs. For example, when they are bored they\u2019ll show purple spirals on his head. You are well equipped to deal with this, but beware! It\u2019s not an easy job.</p>\n<p>For instance, you can use your <strong>treat gun</strong> to <strong>feed </strong>the dogs, but they get <strong>dirty when they eat</strong>.\r\nSo now you have to clean them. Great! You can use your <strong>watergun </strong>for that (beware with this tool, it\u2019s not yet in the market because it needs some tweaking).</p>\n<p>But guess what - <strong>cleaning is boring</strong>, and they know it! You can <strong>play fetch</strong> with them with balls. By the way, you should get them back since you don\u2019t have a lot of them.</p>\n<p>And of course, <strong>playing </strong>with them makes them <strong>hungry</strong>! </p>\n<p>Eventually the owners will come and get them back, so you better take good care of them. Also, <strong>don\u2019t make the owners wait too much</strong> or they\u2019ll get angry!</p>\r\nTHE TEAM\r\nCode\r\n<ul><li><strong>Jaime Muela </strong>https://twitter.com/jaimuepe</li></ul>\r\nArt\r\n<ul><li><strong>Hermes Escriva</strong> https://twitter.com/_hermeses_</li><li><strong>Paloma Pipeleers</strong> https://twitter.com/rhasculpts</li><li><strong>Fran Segura</strong> https://twitter.com/fvsegura</li></ul>\r\nSound\r\n<ul><li><strong>Alvatross</strong> https://twitter.com/AlvatrossKid</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e341624510d28effef935f9a720a0ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jaimuepe"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
