The goal of the game is to collect a set number of spheres placed across the map in the fastest time possible. It includes horizontal and vertical wallruns, rolling, jumping and grabbing ledges. </p>\n<p>The game is very short\u00a0 but trying to beat your own time and master the mechanics can add to the replayability. That said, I wouldn't suggest downloading it if you can't afford the bandwidth.\u00a0 \r\n</p>\n<p>I average around 150fps with\u00a0a\u00a03.5ghz\u00a0i5, 12gb of ram and\u00a0a gtx\u00a01070.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>-Textures pop in on level start often with hitching. This can cause some issues when trying to do a speedrun of the level. I recommend loading the level, quitting or completing it and then immediately restarting the level.\u00a0\u00a0</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3a/a3abe729a25744a0ae92a64e06971825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WinterLantern"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
