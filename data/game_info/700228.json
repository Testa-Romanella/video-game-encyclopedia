I found this game in 2005 and through it I got to know the wonderful world of the First Person Adventure genre. In 2012 I ported it to the interactive DVD platform and posted it on the Internet for free download, then one of the authors of the original DOS version honored the thread with his presence. Now it's time Sega Genesis / MegaDrive platform.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has classic gameplay for this genre and about 10 locations in which you need to perform some actions in order to move on. The game also contains a small story that tells you on your path, it is not very long, but you will have to apply your nous to win and some wrong actions can lead you to the \"game over\".</p>\n<p>There is no music or sounds in the original game. However, I found several sounds in the game files that for some reason are not audible in the game. BUT! It has some audio influenced by and specifically for this game!<br/></p>\n<p>And really important thing -\u00a0 you'll not hear in this game FM or PSG sounds, only DAC-channel with 8 bit low quality sound, which sometimes play with cracks. Unfortunately, it's a limits of the GINCS engine, which I used for developing.</p>\n<p>First time testing on real hardware:</p>\n\n<p>Pre-release testing:</p>\n\n\r\nWarning! Known issues:\r\n<ul><li>An incompatibility issue has been found. The issue will only trigger on Mega Drive 1 or Genesis Model 1, non-TMSS (without the \"Licensed by Sega\" text). If your Mega Drive or Genesis shows the \"Licensed by Sega\" text at power-on, you wont be affected.<p>If affected: The game will not start on first power-on. A workaround: None are known at the moment.</p></li><li>The game might crash if you will insert gun or mouse to Port 2</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for your attention!</p>\n<p>Kind Regards, ChipaGames<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9eb0233d7f3336fe253e369e88ea6d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChipaGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
