The game is playable, start to finish - but there are a lot of things missing relating to the core game (and theme of the jam) that we didn't get time to include. The idea was to have the other highscores AS racers in the game, so that you'd be climbing your way up through a list of other players and leaving them in the dust... but due to scope creep - we couldn't include it and thus the whole \"climbing\" element didn't really come to fruition!\u00a0</strong><br/></p><p><strong><br/>Unfortunate, but I think I speak for all of us when I say that we're proud of what we got done in only three days!
