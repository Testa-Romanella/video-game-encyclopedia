You will be feeling nostalgic after this. The game is simple, You swap blocks and make a 3 in a row match. It's easy but very boring. And that's why I put extra gamemodes.\u00a0This game is also in development, so there will be a lot of bugs and changes.</p>\n\n<p>My Youtube Channel:\u00a0RXTwister - YouTube</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Beta 1.0 - The game's first release</p>\n<p>\u00a0Beta 1.0.1 - Resolution updated, You can fail in classic if you ran out of moves.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/057/057a6c86d23e44fb32a1a3346dbca6ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RXTwister"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
