The game's built using Unreal 4 game engine with real physical system and high performance optimization.  It support single-player, multiplayer and challenge mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn my childhood, I wanted to have a jetpack to fly in the sky. But currently I have no chance to try it in real time. So I'm going to make a game, in which the players can equip jetpacks to shoot each other while flying in the sky. Once I played a mini game in Minecraft called \"Spleef\" - it's about destroying blocks underneath the feet of other players, so that your opponents fall down. That inspired me. I want to make a game play like this - it will be a lot of fun to play together with people around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo we developed this game. All platform blocks in the game can be destroyed. Destroy the block strategically so your opponents have trouble landing on the platform. Maybe this is a more effective strategy than shooting at player directly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is simple, but it's interesting. The game play is intense, you can pick up the game anytime. Play a few minutes and see the world destroyed by you and your opponent , that's a great satisfaction. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy the game with your friend!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/6852648df5ce6a0c81b3c278e2c23008.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 456, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linkflag Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Linkflag Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
