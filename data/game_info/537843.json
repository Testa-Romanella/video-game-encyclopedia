The player can select the direction of the rack by toggling the blue arrow on the left. When the rack is in order, the round is complete and the points are tallied. The winner gets 150 points for the win and bonus points for consecutive runs (25 pts for 2 in a row, 50 pts for 3 in a row, etc.). The loser gets 5 points for each slot from the start of the rack that are in order. The loser does not get any bonus points that may have been shown.</p>\n<p>The game will continue until one player reaches 1000 points and is declared the winner of the match.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c44/c443a5c89abbf8c5a424510a9183d4f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["roccode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
