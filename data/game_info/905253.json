But this loyalty went missing once you started experimenting with the dark arts. The more your knowledge of necromancy grew, the more distrustful and frightened the nearby kingdoms became. One day they decided to put their differences aside to create a huge army to defeat you once and for all. After many years they won the war, scattered your spell book and entombed you in a crypt, locked by a magic spell, never to be opened ever again.\r\n </p>\n<p>Many centuries passed and your story became a legend. A cult started to form around your persona, and after many years of research, they finally found a way to free you from your cage and help you retake what was once yours. They tell you each page of your book is protected by one of the kings of the many kingdoms of the land, and you\u2019ll have to first retake them to regain your full powers.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T10:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a30396c60070881b53c40ef942cbba47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elia Oliosi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
