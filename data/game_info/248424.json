Since release we have introduced items, additional heroes, team-composition penalties, more focus on story, non-linearity and World Map, just to name a few. Now we would like to redesign the original Age of Fear: The Undead King into fantasy mercenary simulator (like a top down Battle Brothers with fireballs and a story!) and progressively add more exciting features.<br/><br/>FEATURE LIST<br/><ul><li><strong>WORLD MAP</strong> known from Age of Fear series with non-linearity and all special locations!<br/></li><li><strong>OPEN WORLD</strong> where you can endlessly explore the Age of Fear world. Fans of the series know it's not only randomised battles, but you can also capture enemies and build your own unique team from over 200+ distinct creatures!<br/></li><li><strong>GLOBAL EVENTS</strong> that are fired while the player party is on the World Map, \u00e0 la Battle Brothers. This feature is still being developed and could serve to provide more lore and enrich unit's interactions!<br/></li><li><strong>FACTION BASES</strong> which can be upgraded as you explore the Age of Fear world. Upgrades will enable additional units, skills and open extra locations!<br/></li><li><strong>ALIGNMENTS</strong> such as Evil and Holy. This feature has been already introduced into Age of Fear series, but requires more work to make it more impactful - currently the game content is skewed too much toward Evil heroes.<br/></li><li><strong>EXTENDED STORY</strong> such as Krill's visions, alternative endings, detailed lore, etc.<br/></li><li>...everything else we come up with! - purchase only if you want to have access to the latest features in age of fear series and keep in mind that this is an evolving product.</li></ul><br/>The above list is not finite. We would also like to experiment more with some mechanics which might be not backward compatible with the current Age of Fear series or un-balance it too much. Therefore, expect changes and more amazing new stuff coming!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e499c70d723778680b88e7bb5423164.jpg", "website": "http://www.age-of-fear.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Leslaw Sliwko"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Age of Fear"], "esrb_rating": null}
