{"id": 350595, "slug": "gaming-constructor-simulator", "name": "Gaming Constructor Simulator", "name_original": "Gaming Constructor Simulator", "description": "First of all you need a good base for your build, so why not take a real F1 car, or a WW2 tank? That\u2019s right! Take a tour to the junkyard, or an action house and buy a car, motorcycle, airplane or even a train (if you have enough money of course). Choose between dozens of vehicles in many different shapes and categories.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take a screwdriver, and a wrench so that you can get rid of parts that you don\u2019t need. If that\u2019s not enough for your needs, you can always switch to some more finesse tools such as hammer or an angle cutter to give your vehicle a desired shape. You have a vehicle, a tool set, and it\u2019s completely up to you what are you going to do with it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Build the ultimate gaming simulator, that you\u2019ve always dreamed of. Add pneumatics to move an entire rig, or a single element. Install frames, input devices, electronics, audio systems, and finally the heart of the whole project - a PC rig, to bring your build to life. Make use of the welders, drills, and any of the tools in your workshop to put it all together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you\u2019re done with all that designing and building, it\u2019s time to test drive your simulator. Choose between few simulations, that you can run on your rig and see for yourself if your build is behaving exactly as you planned, or needs an extra tweaks in some areas. You can always go back to the workshop and push it further until the money runs out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Get the best price for your build, put it on an auction and sell it, or exchange for a rare vehicle that\u2019s unavailable on the market. You can also make use of any of the parts left from the original vehicle such as engines, seats, body elements, and sell them all on the junkyard. <br/>No need to tell you what to do with that freshly earned money you have right?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb489dc9556540bc705c7fb84e509cdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PlayWay"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
