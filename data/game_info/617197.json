If you line up with another robot you will autoconnect to it and start matching movement. Sometimes this will be to your advantage, but not always...<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are arrow keys or WASD for movement. R to reset. <br/></p><p>Duplex was made for the 2021 GMTK Game Jam, but if you try it out and like it, please let me know @btsherratt and I might consider turning it into a proper project in the future!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY WARNING: There is screen shake, and no way to turn it off in this build.
