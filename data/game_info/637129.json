{"id": 637129, "slug": "dorm-disaster", "name": "Dorm Disaster", "name_original": "Dorm Disaster", "description": "<p>NOTE: The headphones item mesh renderer was accidentally turned off... oops :( If you can get to a score of 14 you win</p><p>Here is the fixed version:\u00a0https://stephenschuster.itch.io/dorm-disaster\u00a0The only difference is the headphones' mesh renderer is enabled. If you are going to rate the game, I'd recommend you play the fixed version, but keep in mind that it's practically impossible to win in the original because the headphones are invisible. It still is technically possible to win and see the \"you win\" screen because the headphones are still there, just invisible.</p>\n<p>Also, remember you can adjust volume in Settings</p>\n<p>This is a 3d platform/puzzle/no genre game where you essentially have to use a grappling hook to get items into a box. It's pretty difficult, so good luck. I recommend starting on Regular with no timer before jumping into Easy, Medium, Hard or Endless. The story goes like this(this is also in the How To Play):</p>\n<p>You were packing up your college dorm to leave when somehow you were shrunk down to a little tiny ant person! And you still need to pack up your dorm! How will you do it? Thankfully you have a grappling hook. If you fire it you'll either pull your target towards you are be pulled to your target. Get items into the cardboard\u00a0box to score points. Get all 15 items before the timer runs out! In endless mode, items will respawn and your countdown will increase with each item. You can start with any item, but there will be a random suggestion in the top right. Tip: if you're pulling an object, the farther you are from the object the harder you'll pull it. Also, heavier objects are harder to pull. Super Bonus Tip: you can cancel the grappling hook when you're being pulled by jumping</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD to Move, Left click to fire the grappling hook, Space to Jump</p>\n<p>If you're stuck, remember, you can hook to the ceiling to get some height and then you can grab items at an angle. Once they're in the air go to the different sides of the box so the item comes down at the right angle. If there's some you can't find... don't keep reading if you don't want to be spoiled...............last chance...........................I should tell you that you can open certain compartments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T13:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/370/37046693ccc157b3c5b2313faef7f827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StephenSchuster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
