Relations between nations must be kept in order to secure peace. That's where you come in. </p>\n<p>You are tasked with monitoring and connecting calls between the Americans and the Russians. Connect the wires from the left side of the screen to the right to successfully link the calls. </p>\n<p>The service is a bit spotty when making long distance calls, so some calls will require you to rewire through substations. Use multiple wires to connect different colored substations together. If a call requires a reroute, it will be shown in the info box. </p>\n<p>On the desk, you\u2019ll see a button and lever. You\u2019ll need those to modify the signal to properly connect some calls. Flipping the dial or switch affects all calls, so make sure to flip it off once you\u2019re done!</p>\n<p>Tensions are high, the world is at stake, but we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll manage everything just fine. Just don\u2019t worry about the doomsday clock, and have fun with it!</p><p>We had a lot of fun working on this game and are currently working on expanding it into a full release sometime in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db0dca7cd144ad65b884bdef8a9b78e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brett Prank"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
