Basically I\u00a0wanted to make you feel like Sergio Layos, Ruben Alcantara, Chase Hawk\u00a0or Tommy Dugan\u00a0 ( sorry about the long intro ):</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you have never played rocket league, I'm not going to lie, the controls will probably be hard to use! this is my first attempt at making a game for gamepad, and I\u00a0did my best, but sometimes our best just isn't enough!</p>\n<p>Anyway, have fun, and enjoy\u00a0 MOON BALL!</p>\n<p>Although it is *MASSIVELY* disorganized, and doesn't have much useful, the code is up over here:\u00a0https://github.com/cabbibo/moonBall1\u00a0if you are into that kind of thing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T03:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db1a3d59daab3546cfa180da4ffa4685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cabbibo"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
