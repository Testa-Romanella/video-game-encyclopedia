All of the sights, sounds and experiences Purgatory has to offer in one concise bundle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<h3>Brutal Orchestra</h3>\nHieronymus Bosch's Brutal Orchestra is a Turn-Based Roguelike Strategy Game with resource management and deck-building elements. Employ the help of damaged and daring fools, equip ancient and insidious items and make deals with the devil on your path to revenge.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRevenge:\n<br/>\nYou died. Someone killed you. You are now in Purgatory and you will never escape. Make a deal with the \"demon\" Bosch and set off into this brutal and bastardous world, finding \u200ball manner of demented and degenerate friends and foes on your quest to get petty revenge.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPigment: \n<br/>\nPurgatory bleeds pigment. It is a strange substance that Bosch has granted you the ability to control. Channeling pigment allows one to perform powerful and absurd abilities. Pigment comes in many colours, each derived from a different source, some even of your own flesh.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFools: \n<br/>\nThis may be a place of the dead but even here there are still poor fools eking out a pathetic existence. Some would make for valuable party members or at least entertaining conversation. Most, however, are dim wits or damaged beyond all reason.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHell: \n<br/>\nPurgatory is not a gentle place, it is a writhing dump of all that has died in many worlds. Endless deserts of pale sand are stalked by parasitic fish. Storm-cloaked mountain tops hide ungodly things above and below. The Garden waits for you at the end of time.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHieronymus Bosch's Brutal Orchestra was developed by Talia bob Mair and Nicol\u00e1s Delgado. With Sound Design by Pato Flores and Chris Dang and Composed by Publio Delgado.\n<br/>\n<h3>Brutal Orchestra Soundtrack</h3>\n\n\"Do you hear that? It almost sounds like music?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nBrutal Orchestra's Purgatory is a place of strange beauty and soul shifting music all composed and curated by the talented Publio Delgado.<br/>\n<br/>\nListen to the sounds of damned souls from far below, the songs of strange blooming instruments and lullaby's whispered by mistakes refusing to be forgotten.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis soundtrack contains 35 tracks from Brutal Orchestra and 6 tracks from Brutal Orchestra's Egg of Incubus content update as well as all future free content updates!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T05:35:51", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Talia bob Mair", "Nicol\u00e1s Delgado"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Hellbent Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
