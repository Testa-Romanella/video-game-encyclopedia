Before each obstacle, the player gets presented with a selection of possible abilities to choose from. The player needs to decide in which order they want to use those abilities to make it past the obstacle. The order is stored in a queue visible to the player, where each press of the \"Action\" button results in activating the next ability in line. While overcoming the obstacle, the right timing and precision is required to succeed.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>A, D: Move left/right<br/>Space: Action<br/>Mouse: Click on buttons</p>\r\nFuture Plans\r\n<p>The game will be developed further to add environmental effects, like resetting or locking the action queue, more abilities, more levels, hidden coins and much more. At some point, it will be released on Android, Steam and potentially other platforms, so stay tuned!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T05:46:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940261945991ae6a25595306842fc129.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["KuroiX", "Daki21"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
