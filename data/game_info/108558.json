Each and every space is letted as a living area to house people, to the point where rooftops are apartments, stores, and restaurants often. In the Undercity, you're always on the roof of something, and there's always something above you.<br/></p><p>When the universe sidetracks one on laundry day, which leads to the discovery of a key Kshatriya artifact, a good day can quickly turn bad. Play as a faceless civilian thrust into a world of trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Follow the mysterious runner and figure out why he stole that shiny thing you found.</p><p>This was the first planned episode in a never ending series of short episodic shooter games spanning many time periods and locales about powerful alien artifacts that influence and intoxicate those in their immediate vicinity. </p><p>Pay close attention to the loading screens and cutscenes, and understand that this game is buggy, shitty, single player, and only lasts 15 minutes. also, all the voice acting was done by me and a few friends so dont hate too hard. (although I would appreciate comments and constructive criticism)</p><p>all animations and props were made by my friend adrian and I, however I spearheaded this project so I'd say the vast majority of the work is mine. it was made in FPS Creator in a few months.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d2323d79b09811c063d3c59f4f98676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 229, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wraybies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
