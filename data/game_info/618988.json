You must carry around crates filled with radioactive material to power drones, gates, more! To fit within the theme of 'Join together' for the 2021 GMTK game jam we created platforms\u00a0which glide along rails to join together and a machine called the conjoiner which merges different colour crates to create a new one.\u00a0Using many other machines\u00a0such as the pistons, colour infusers, and duplicators your little robot is able to make his crafty escape!</p>\n\n<p>WASD keys are used for player movement and controlled platform movement. Q and E is used to turn the character or switch between different controlled platforms when using a control panel. Space key is used to interact with machines and to pick up and place down crates. Use R to restart the current level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once powered gates will remain open even after the power source is removed</p>\n<p>Once charged drones will stay powered even once the power source is removed</p>\n<p>Pistons can only push crates</p>\n<p>Drones will not break when contacting crates but will\u00a0break if colliding will any solid objects (all machines, walls, and gates)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:51:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01ae1e729f0fd0f11a4f79a9f58077bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spicy Chicken", "Pixel Overload", "Foxyboi88"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
