Right now the game is basically in creative mode, other then the hammer witch still requires coins. But play around, find coins and build things and shoot things if you want, all Items are in the inventory by pressing the \"E\" key. Thats all for now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12b/12be18e242448777e57397bffbcbd309.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IChoMo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
