Or a challenge, workout or practice if you wanna try the Hard mode.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRoom setup is required for this game with the minimum space of at least 2m by 1.5m or 6.5 feet by 5 feet.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:10:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/695b513c0e95e9dbf90eb013226d57b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 284, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InitiativeVR"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["InitiativeVR"], "esrb_rating": null}
