You can upgrade different parts of it after every wave of enemies with the money they drop once they are eliminated.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You can upgrade your movement speed, reload time, bullet damage or even the amount of bullets fired per shot. But you will also need to spend some money on repairs, so don't spend it all at once.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>Every wave will be harder than the one before. There will be more enemies and new enemy types to fight. Good luck!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a work in progress.\u00a0Feedback and/or ideas are greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T11:53:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c0b74d8e1a13237af3d0df108b20acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["janistch"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
