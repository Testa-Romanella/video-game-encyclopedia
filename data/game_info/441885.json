I ultimately exceeded the 2 hour limit for making the game, since I struggled making the controls for the player work, and thus did not submit it to the Jam.

A list of things I'd like to add are:</p>\n<ul><li>Critters to interact with.</li><li>The ability to launch probes.</li><li>Faster generation (possibly shader-based on GPU, or with different threads)</li><li>Larger \"planets\".</li><li>Generation based on different noises and/or fractal structures inside the planet to explore.</li><li>Marching cubes to make smoother \"voxels\".</li><li>More block types and a way to interact with them.</li></ul>\n<p>Control scheme:</p>\n<p>w -&gt; Accelerate Forward<br/>a -&gt; Accelerate Leftward<br/>s -&gt; Accelerate Backward<br/>d -&gt; Accelerate Rightward<br/>shift -&gt; Accelerate Downward<br/>Space -&gt; Accelerate Upward</p>\n<p>q -&gt; Roll anti-clockwise<br/>e -&gt; Roll clockwise<br/>mouse movement -&gt; Rolls up/down and left-right</p>\n<p>z -&gt; Linear movement brake<br/>x -&gt; Angular movement brake</p>\n<p>r -&gt; Restarts the game and puts you back on the menu screen</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Background music by Sudocolon</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T02:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f39009f7ab8171a29d7a6629f5db022e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Um Singelo Pug Manco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
