You have to carefully decide where to put your towers. Because the tower price goes up, the enemies steal money, and if you run out of money the game is over.</p>\n<p>This is a project I made in my free time\u00a0to learn path-finding. I followed\u00a0the instructions from the Udemy course\u00a0\"Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D\", but I also made many changes like randomizing the routes.</p>\n\n<p>Music:\u00a0https://www.bensound.com</p>\n<p>3D Assets: downloaded from\u00a0Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D\u00a0(the Realm Rush section by Gary Pettie)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T05:05:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18a/18a75997e680bfed6e8366711c88dc5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StacyGao"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
