When I\u2019m not working as a Freelance Illustrator and English instructor, I am creating whimsical illustrations that tell a story. I love creating fantastical environments full of interesting creatures and characters that conveys a sense of mystery and adventure.</p>\n<p>I am also a musician and the creator of the soundtrack of Finders Keepers. I write folk music in my spare time. I love the process of creating songs that express special moments in life that can be remembered forever through the power of a melody.</p>\n<p>I am inspired by the likes of Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Elliot Smith, Conor Oberst, Bjork, The Strokes, and Joanna Newsom.</p>\n<p>This is my first Visual Novel Project and I\u2019m so excited to share my art and music through this amazing genre.</p>\n<p>I will be releasing the game on Steam and Itch.o with or without this Kickstarter, but your support means the world to me! Since I\u2019m the only one working on the project, any support I receive is greatly and truly appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>A Mission to Share an Epic Tale of Overcoming Your Fears</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always wanted to merge my two passions of art and music in a project that conveys a story of self-discovery, love, friendship, and overcoming your inner saboteur. I am aiming at creating a Visual Novel that will inspire you, make you laugh, cry, wonder, dream, and seek. Of course, there will be romance, character development, and an epic storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>\n<p>\u2018Finders Keepers\u2019 is a near and dear story from my heart that has been a form of therapy for me. When I\u2019m not working on client work, I\u2019ve been working away at this project. I decided to turn to crowd funding to share my vision with others who love art and folk music.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for your interest!
