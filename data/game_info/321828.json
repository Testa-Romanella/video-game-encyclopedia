Thanks for checking out my game.This is a short game that I\u00a0developed during my junior year of high school to improve my coding skills. It took about nine months to make and was fun all the way through. I now want to start a new project making a completely new game. If you enjoyed this and want to see more from me please consider donating; all donations will go toward my next game in artist commissions, software cost, music, etc.. Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb6/cb6d4043f4b36db793e97da8c452bea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabriel Miller"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
