This game-<strong>wannabe </strong>is just an <strong>experimental </strong>project of mine\u00a0I started out for <strong>educating </strong>myself. And it just happened that I wanted to share it with people. I know, I know. There's literally\u00a0<em>zero</em> content in it but\u00a0it's here for getting responses on the already working mechanics. Should I do as I think it's good or should I reconsider how I approach implementing mechanics?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fate of this project: <strong><em>UNKOWN</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:46:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f506d257f6929568d1fd97119119081d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sens1tiv"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
