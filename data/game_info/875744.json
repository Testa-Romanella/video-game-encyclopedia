Shady brokers from all across Ethshar bring their magical items for you to appraise. Collaborate with your apprentice to abate the volatile magic within the talismans, preferably before they explode. It\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s certainly not honest work.</p>\n<p>The Shady Talisman is a cooperative puzzle game inspired by <em>Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes</em>, where two players work together to stabilize talismans before they explode. One player plays as the Sorcerer, and is directly experimenting with the talisman, while the other plays as the Apprentice, and uses the Manuals to guide the Sorcerer through the process from a safe distance. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10fa5f150f807653fc31ced074945fda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheRedTeam"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
