The new administration wants to cut the Titan rover project. The data tells us we were on the brink of a major discovery. All our hard work on keeping that rover running for 40 years is going to end in 2 weeks...</p>\n\n<p>Well, sure, we haven't really been running it at full steam lately, as you know. The last person who knew how to drive the rover, Bobby Williams, passed away a year ago. But listen, if we want to keep our jobs, we have to try moving that rover. I know it's crazy, we might have slim chances, but it's worth a try. If we succeed in finding real evidence, we'll convince the nation that it wasn't a waste of taxpayers money!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Made during #LD46 by:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Ivan Notaros, @nothke - art, code, story</li><li>Dario Zubovic, @dario_zubovic - code, rover language and compiler, documentation</li><li>Sa\u0161a Duki\u0107 - sound, music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a30ef1ccc50a161a5616d318100b734.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nothke", "dario-zubovic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
