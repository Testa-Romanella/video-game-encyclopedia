The larger the patch, the larger the score! Aim for a perfect plot with no flowers singled out, and try by all means not to leave more than the maximum allowed number of misses on a single level, or you'll lose the game.<br/></p><p><strong>Basic controls</strong></p><p>The game is really easy to play: just place flowers as they appear until either the plot is full or you've made 5 misses. To place them, touch and drag the flower from the \"Current\" slot onto an empty slot on the grid. Release it when you're sure, and you're done! Now rinse and repeat :)</p><p>If you release outside the grid, or on top of an occupied tile you'll have to retry your action.<br/><br/>Some tiles have additional requirements. For example, it may force you to place a specific flower, or a flower of a specific colour, or on the contrary, forbid you to place them!<br/><br/>Try to perfect all the levels!<br/><br/>PS: The game is still in a very early stage, so expect radical changes. For example, this past iteration added levels, but got rid of power-ups for balancing reasons.</p><p>PS-2: If you get stuck, you can access the debug menu to skip the current level or even clear your whole progression. Click on the \"DBG\" button and there you go.<br/></p><p><strong>CHANGELOG</strong></p><p><strong>v0.0.7 (08/08/2016)</strong></p><p>Fixed crash caused by previous save files not being properly detected.</p><p><strong>v0.0.6 (07/08/2016)</strong></p><p>Rehashed and added many more levels.
