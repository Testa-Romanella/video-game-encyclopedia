That is not the case, so this is pretty important unless you want to be like \"What. Just. Happened.\" at the beginning of the game. So the story is that you are a robot that crashes and you have nothing left in your battery except for a little bit of power in the reserves.</p>\r\nGame play:\r\n<p>Basically you run around 'solving' puzzles that I quickly put together in the last three hours of the jam. Also there are only three levels.</p>\r\nState:\r\n<p>Not my best LD. It's a neat little thing with promise I'd say but is in dire need of better graphics and the puzzles are busy-work at best, I'd say it's relatively incomplete, but seeing as I didn't think I would even have time to make more then the first level, it's passable. Most importantly, it's playable. Even if not that fun......</p>\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\n<p>SCOPE. For a LDJAM this was do-able, I just forgot that I only had 16 hours, and in that time, this was definitely not do-able.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:36:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f8e/f8e268f2984fdb1a34a333d5efc39319.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sharks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
