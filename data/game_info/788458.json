Players need to learn the story and background of the character by reading their character's script and deducing the spy hidden among them by using clues.</p>\n<p>The facilitator takes control of the game and helps the players to play the game according to the host's manual.</p>\n<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>\n<p>This is a game similar to Murder Mystery Game.</p>\n<p>But the difference is that instead of finding the killer, the players need to find a spy in this chapter of the game.</p>\n<p>In order not to be dramatic, I can't write more about the story here. But if you're a fan of LARP games too, give it a go!</p>\n<p><strong>The goal of this game</strong></p>\n<p>Finding out the real spy!</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>\n<p>The reason for making this game is that I personally love the Mystery Murder Game, not only do I enjoy the deduction and finding out the truth, but I am also fascinated by the cooperation and arguments when playing with friends.</p>\n<p>The theme of this chapter is finding the spy because I recently reviewed a Chinese film about spies, The Message.\u00a0\u00a0And in my opinion,\u00a0 it is no less fun to find out who is hiding among people than it is to find the real killer.</p>\n<p><strong>Troubles and Thinking</strong></p>\n<p>Although I had written a few scripts before this, this was my first attempt at making this type of game.</p>\n<p>In the process of making it, I found it to be very different from writing a script. The designer needs to think over and over about whether he has given all the necessary information in the script and whether the clues are too obvious.</p>\n<p>But overall, I really enjoyed the process of making this one. Because it's the kind of story I like, and it's the kind of game I like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T15:16:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d92cb99695a79ec5a04f508adf5efe7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yuyif5"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
