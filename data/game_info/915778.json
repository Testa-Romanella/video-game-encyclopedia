There will be enemies so be careful. Some levels require set amount of keys to open the door. Have fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the game i made when i started learning making it. It is my first project. It was sitting on my hard drive and i thought why not upload it on itch.io? So here it is. If you guys like it i can continue developing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Notes :</p>\n<p>*There is a secret in the level 3. If you manage to get to the left you will find it</p>\n<p>*If your weapon doesnt shoot when it should just switch weapons and it will work. It is a bug</p>\n<p>*Quality setting does nothing.</p>\n<p>*Your total coin count is saved. It does nothing also. I don't know why i did it.</p>\n<p>*Music might suck because i made it :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>*That health bar took me 6 hours to make!</p>\n<p>*You can enter every level with the input bar on the main menu. Just type level number and hit enter.</p>\n<p>*Total of 13 levels i think.</p>\n<p>*Every time you load a level background(the one you cant interact) is generated randomly. its cool i think.</p>\n<p>*Expect bugs.</p>\n<p>*If you stuck just restart or load up another level on main menu.</p>\n<p>*Comment if you played and want me to develop further.</p>\n<p>*This game only available here . You are so special :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T11:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87d5f7199a7f19654b269b6e7cb9f007.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AgerGames"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
