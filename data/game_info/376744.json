{"id": 376744, "slug": "fields", "name": "Fields", "name_original": "Fields", "description": "<p>Fields is a small passion project to explore an analogy brought up by Allie Brosh in her book<em> Hyperbole and a Half</em>. In the chapter titled \"Adventures in Depression Part Two\", she describes her experiences with depression to be like walking through a field and reaching a gate. You can go through the gate, but you are still in the field.\u00a0I designed this game in an attempt to try and capture the feeling of going through that gate and still feeling lost.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I'm uploading this pretty late on a whim. I designed this a few months ago, and it is super buggy. I don't expect anyone to have a ton of fun playing this \"game\", but I hope the experience lingers a bit. (Also, there is an ending. I think you'll know when you get there.) I think it does manage to convey a bit of atmosphere. I really want to touch up on it in a few places, but anyway, take a swing at it while you can.</p>\n<p>Good luck.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:09:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b70/b709a8fa1f59a4730f432d3555691558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LemonProphet"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
