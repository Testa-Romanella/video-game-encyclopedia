Now, stuck in a dimension where time flies by, you have to solve puzzles (Straight Out Of Hell\u2122) to reach the end portal that leads out of this dimension that troubles you.</p>\n<p>While you\u2019re crawl through this world you can find items\u00a0(clocks, eleven of them!) that raises your limited time. Because you\u2019re starting with just 20 seconds on the clock. This, as being said, can be raised so you have more time to go deeper into this dungeon-like dimension.</p>\n<p>Have a close eye on what each lever or button does, there are multiple possibilities. Dont forget to avoid traps of all sorts.</p>\n<p>Now then, up to this point you have probably spend more time reading than your\u00a0starting time might be. Time to get out of this loop.
