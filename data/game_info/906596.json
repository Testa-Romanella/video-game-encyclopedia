Earn more score than your AI opponents to win!</p>\n<p>In Bugs Sim you compete against AI opponents to complete the map goal(s) before they do.\u00a0<strong><em>You do not control your bugs directly!</em></strong>\u00a0Each bugs has their own level of energy and hunger which they indicate through their thought bubbles.\u00a0When they get tired, they sleep. When they get hungry they eat. When they are rested and full... they wander aimlessly!<br/></p>\n<p>I've been slowly learning how to do game development using Unity as a hobby. This project\u00a0is the culmination of that and the first project I've released into the wild! Enjoy!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left click spawns a bug, plant, or sticky depending on which button is selected at the bottom of the screen. These each costs points to spawn.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Bug </strong>(costs 50 points)<br/>Each player has bugs which act on their own depending on their current hunger, energy, etc. Each bug\u00a0 awards points every few seconds for the player. Bugs can be placed on grass, sand, or dirt and like to eat plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Plant</strong> (costs 20 point)<br/>Plants are neutral\u00a0 and take a few seconds to grow once placed. Each plant can be eaten from a few times before disappearing. Eating a plant awards points. Plants can only be placed on grass.</p>\n<p><strong>Sticky </strong>(costs 5 points)<br/>A sticky causes any other player's bug that touches it to move at a crawl. Stickies disappear after a few seconds and release any trapped bugs. They can be placed on grass, sand, or dirt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T10:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/539355c7807ca6be2e822e9ef8494e52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["blastoboom"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
