Your excavations have not gone so well this year, failing to find any trace of the legendary and as yet undiscovered Pharaohs tomb. Then in your final weeks wild stories recounting the wrath of vengeful mummies strangling would be tomb local raiders filter back to base camp.</p>\n<p>At last some concrete leads worth looking into, and opportunities to good to pass up. Oculist tales of curses be dammed, you're an Egyptologist and grand adventurer, such nonsense can't possibly hurt you. Or can it?</p>\n<strong>TuT-TuT on the ZX81</strong>\n<p>I wrote the original version of Tut-Tut as a type-in game for the ZX Spectrum and published it in Paleotronic Magazine. The ZX81 version of Tut-Tut has been written in C, targeted towards Z88dk for compilation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite constantly changing implementation languages and machines, TuT's core game mechanics and functionality are all based around the algorithms and techniques outlined in the Paleotronic article.</p>\n<p>Opportunities have been taken to add additional elements. The size and scope of TuT-TuT\u00a0 increased considerably for the ZX81 version, there are now 28 normal levels, plus 1 special level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Extra levels necessitated the creation of a couple of additional items to hold player interest; Amulets and Bracelets provide chances for scoring extra points alongside the potential disadvantage of actually interacting with the items.</p>\n<p>After writing the ZX81 version I've gone back and re-ported the game back to the ZX Spectrum. That version,\u00a0\u00a0TuT-TuT 2020 Edition (ZX Spectrum) is also available and expands on the ZX81 title.\u00a0</p><p>All the history and extended details behind the Development and various versions of TuT-TuT can found on ZX81 Keyboard Adventure Blog Page.<br/></p>\r\nExcavate a Physical Copy of the Game\r\n<ul><li>Cassette copies of the game are available from\u00a0\u00a0Cronosoft</li></ul>\n<p>You'll require a Real ZX81 or a ZX81 Emulator to play this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae61a23576b555291e168eca9eeedf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zx81keyboardadventure"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
