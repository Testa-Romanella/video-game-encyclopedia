At the beginning of the game, the player only knows that collecting a chime will increase their chime counter at the top left side of the screen. As the game progresses, they will begin to unlock new ways to utilize their chimes, and also figure out that messing up will subtract from that count. The mechanics that are available to the player is mainly utilizing how they move/jump. Since gravity plays a large role in the game and using a chime will lower the gravity, the player must take that into account when going for a risky jump. The system rewards the player with large amounts of chimes if they complete an optional side task.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The alternative approach in this game is that\u00a0the player can decide how to use their resources and does not have a health bar or lives. The player uses the same resource: Chimes as their health and as a powerup. They are able to choose whether to utilize the power ups to speed through the level quickly(risky), or to save up their chimes and tank their way through the harder parts of the level.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T07:18:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc0/bc0795219b0d2c28fe6150bfa61f111b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conciliated"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
