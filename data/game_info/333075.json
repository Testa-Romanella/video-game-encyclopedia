{"id": 333075, "slug": "death-or-glory", "name": "Death or Glory", "name_original": "Death or Glory", "description": "<h3>Every deck is a character, every card is an action!</h3><br/>Become a champion in a world where magic and bullets collide. Where gods use their might to fight mechs and werewolves, and build rage to tear apart warriors. Every card is an action; every action can have a reaction. <br/><br/><br/>Aggressive champions beat down their enemies with burn, poison, and stun. Controlling champions respond with parries and protective barriers. Death or Glory is built around a combo focussed gameplay where you can deal incredible bursts of damage or shut your opponent down with strategic counters.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Different Champions. Different Rules!</h3></strong><br/>The champions of Death or Glory make up five different classes, all with a unique play style and resource system. Piloting a mech requires you to manage the system's heat to play devastating combos. Fighting as a feral werewolf means you\u2019ll need to harness rage to slash away at your opponent's health. <br/><br/>Each champion and class holds its own secrets to dueling success. Learn to master the classes in the Arena, where you face off in increasingly difficult towers, unlocking new cards and the secrets to their success.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>A Roguelike Adventure</h3></strong><br/>Death or Glory features a full roguelike campaign. Venture through the challenging lands, earn powerful cards, discover new treasures, and upgrade your deck to unlock its full potential.<br/><br/>Every path that is taken, vampire you slay, spirit blessed, and shop visited is important on your quest to overcome the world boss. Leading a champion to glory in the roguelike adventure mode will reward you with both in-game currency and champion XP.<h3>Key Features</h3><br/>- <strong>Five Classes with Five Unique Resource Systems</strong> - No two classes play alike. Spellslingers will accumulate Mana whilst Monsters will Unleash. Evangelists will pray to Transcend, a Techie will need to reload and a Warrior controls tempo through their Momentum. <br/><br/>- <strong>Character Decks</strong>  - Every character has unique mechanics and befitting cards that can only be played by them. A Ninja will have nimble and fast cards whilst a lumbering Giant has powerful and heavy attacks. Every champion you play, and every challenger you fight will present a new challenge and different experiences. <br/><br/>- <strong>Dynamic Turn Control</strong> - Both players share a turn. As soon as you counter your opponent's card, you seize the initiative and gain control of the battle. <br/><br/>- <strong>Embark on an Adventure</strong> - The rogue-like single player mode will make players choose between multiple paths to take on a journey. Different choices will result in different rewards and the playstyle of every champion will constantly adapt with every card rewarded. <br/><br/>- <strong>Evolving Variations</strong> - Whenever you fight in a new location, the rules of the game could change. Modifiers will create a paradigm shift in how you choose to fight every time you battle an opponent. Coupled with random loot and your choice of upgraded cards, the game is designed for endless replayability. <br/><br/>- <strong>Multiplayer</strong> - Duel your friends in a deathmatch to see who has the winning strategy. Climb the ladder for Seasonal rewards and the taste of glory against your rivals.<br/><br/>- <strong>Monetization</strong> - All characters are unlockable by earning in-game currency with NO PAYWALL.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T04:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b723807d8b234a9e30718c9d9f2978d5.jpg", "website": "https://www.deathorglory-game.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 379, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Distilled Gaming Company"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Distilled Gaming Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
