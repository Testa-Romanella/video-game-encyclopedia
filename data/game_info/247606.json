You have the option to flip the blocks by 90 degree units and you can also make them move down quickly, with the aim of creating a horizontal or vertical line of four similar blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. As the score increases, the blocks fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playing field and no new sequence of blocks are able to enter.<br/><br/>Game Features :-<br/><br/>* Awesome gameplay <br/>* Clean UI  <br/>* Nice music and sound effects <br/>* Cool animations<br/>* No IAP, no ads and much more....<br/><br/>Avoid the blocks from getting to the top of the playing field and have fun.......", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/cafc6da99efc5c494e3ff381908668b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Priti Kaloni"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Family"], "publishers": ["Priti Kaloni"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
