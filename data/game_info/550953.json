Hopefully I'll find the time to update this in the future to include more things, and make it more fun to play.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: This is a submission to the Finally Finish Something game jam (FFSjam) 2021.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T07:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88cfb6a211ef6d1d82def889ffd78df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jayzonty"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
