On their return from the Haunted Castle, the Great \n      Devil kidnaps Lala and challenges Lolo to rescue her again. Now he must \n      take on the challenge of the Great Devil\u2019s Tower and Castle mazes. \n      Fortunately, Lala was able to analyze each of the mazes as she was taken \n      to the tower and left clues in the Jewel Boxes in each room. Each Jewel \n      that Lolo collects contains information that will help him in the next \n      room. In order to succeed, he\u2019ll also have to push tiles, pick up Heart \n      Framers, temporarily turn enemies into Eggs with his Magic Shots, and \n      ward off enemy attacks by moving Emerald Framers. With your help, Lolo \n      and Lala will work together to escape the Great Devil\u2019s clutches and \n      defeat him!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
