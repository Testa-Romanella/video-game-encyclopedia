The goal of this game is to get to the top of this platformer level. The catch? If you fail, You get set back. This game was heavily inspired by \"Getting over it with Bennet Foddy\". I mixed the ease of pixel art with the rage aspects of platformers in general and poof! You get this game.</p>\n\n<p>- SasanEX</p>\n<p><strong>Controls A/D/Space</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T09:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b7/7b7076d551836bbdd9f2e8563748cb62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["SasanEX5072"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
