You don't focus on speciffic people - those are born and die, but the name is something that persists.</p>\n<p>Members of your family will spread across the country, living in safety of Monastery or in the dangerous Outland and try to fulfill their lifetime goals that will raise your House and strenghten your position on the throne. They will grow old, fail and die, but as long as your Kin holds the crown, they fulfilled their destiny.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Our Kin is a DM-less role-playing game.
