Rats today ride big steam-powered machines, gears, and hatred against everything and everyone.<br/>Casinos, bars, streets, a reality full of sentinels armed to the teeth under the tyranny of the rats. Religion, politics, and power surrounding them, and a lot, lot of cheese, which is the main source of post-RATZation economics and that \"casually\" only the rat race has them.<br/>In this world of smoke and fear, Black and White are a pair of cats that are members of FATE CATZ, an organization born between the dream of freedom, using resistance as the only weapon through various maps and against countless robots and freaks, thus knowing little by little the story behind all this transition, in order to restore peace and rescue their friends retained by the army, for dreaming beyond what for the RATZ is only fate.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse is used for interations with the GameBoy.</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys\u00a0 is used\u00a0for moviment,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Z and X are used as A and B in Gameboy.</p>\n<p>Left Shift is Select in Gameboy and is used for change the Cats on the game.</p>\n<p>Enter is Start and is\u00a0used for submmit.</p><p>Created by:\u00a0Allan David, Jessica Crevelari, Gilberto Domingos, Ricardo Clarin.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:02:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e65387751e8a3d7d4becd12ecaa05e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Blackbell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
