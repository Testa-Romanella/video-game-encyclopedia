Score is tied to health; so health is increased which provides the player with security. Score is also the main measurement by which your run is measured and affects your high score. Killing enemies also provides the player with a combo multiplier. Finally, more score unlocks additional abilities for the player to use to kill enemies.<br/><br/>Almost all the mechanics in the game implement some form of dual purpose design as well. Take for example something as simple as taking damage from enemies. This resets the players combo multiplier as well as decreases their health and therefore their score. This small interconnected-ness gives a layer of depth all of its related mechanics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>New Mechanics Are Unlocked At Every 100 Points</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move: 'A' and 'D'</li><li>Jump: 'Space Bar'</li><li>Fire: 'LMB'</li><li>Alternate Fire:\u00a0'RMB'</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e5/9e592273ac6221a1223122557f4ce599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["juman22"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
