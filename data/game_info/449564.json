This is the story of Collin, the one who did such things.<br/></p>\n<p>Collin was a lot of things, he was either an ordinary boy with no real talent, a sneaky ninja, a running master, or a perfect being. He says he was all of these things, but which one of them is true? Well that's the beauty of human imagination, you can imagine yourself what he was, there's no real answer after all when it comes to Collin.</p>\n<p>As days progressed into weeks, weeks into months, months into years, years into decades, decades into centuries, centuries into millennia, Collin never changed. How, you may ask? Well...nobody knows. Who on earth knows who Collin even is, or...<em>what</em>\u00a0he is?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>This game was made in under a week and I would greatly appreciate any and all criticism of the game!
