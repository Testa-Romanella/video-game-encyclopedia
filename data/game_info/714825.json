DOUBLE-JUMP\r\nYou are able to make\u00a0<em><strong>double jump\u00a0</strong></em>by hitting the Jump button twice!\r\n\r\n<p>We missed to mention this in a released version (as we didn't manage to finish the tutorial in-time). We are working hard to finalize the tutorial in our next build.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Player 1:</strong>\n<br/><strong>A-D\u00a0</strong>-&gt; move left and right\r\n<br/><strong>W</strong> -&gt; Jump\r\n<br/><strong>W (twice)\u00a0</strong>-&gt; double jump\r\n<br/><strong>S</strong> -&gt; switch the color\r\n<br/><strong>Space\u00a0</strong>-&gt; diffuse the glitch boxes\r\n<br/><strong>Player 2:</strong>\n<br/><strong>Left / Right\u00a0</strong>-&gt; well you got it...\r\n<br/><strong>Up\u00a0</strong>-&gt; Jump\r\n<br/><strong>Up twice</strong> -&gt; Double Jump\r\n<br/><strong>Down\u00a0</strong>-&gt; switch the color\r\n<br/><strong>Shift\u00a0</strong>-&gt; diffuse the glitch boxes\r\n\r\n<p>Glitches:\r\n</p>\n<p>With every glitch stacking up in your network the respective system protection is being compromised. When 10 glitches of same colors stack up the system starts to glitch making it harder to protect your network:\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Grey Glitch - Social Engineering:</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Hijacks the sensitive data about the spaceship protectors by disguising itself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Makes all stacked glitches to be the same color, so pay attention to the glitch icon!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Blue Glitch - DDOS attack</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Hacks the systems by spamming the service provider with requests from different sources.\r\n</p>\n<p>When the system is hacked it can no longer provide decent service, so it takes you more time to switch the color.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Green Glitch - XSS attack</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Launches the malicious scripts leading to appearance of uncontrolled glitches that try to stop you, whenever they can.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Red Glitch - CSRF attack</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>Tricks the system admin AI on your spaceship and temporarily blocks the cells on your network grid, preventing you from diffusing new glitches.\r\n</p>\n<p>Game Over conditions:\r\n</p>\n<p>You are the most sophisticated system protection there is on the ship, so the game ends when you get destroyed.\r\n</p>\n<p>When one of these conditions happen, your self-destruction protocol is launched and you have 10 seconds to save the day:\r\n</p>\n<p> All 4 system protection modules are hacked by glitches<br/>You'll have to diffuse enough glitches to restore at least one protection module (color).\r\n</p>\n\n<p>When or you get stuck under the pile of glitches, your system is being hacked by glitches directly, so act fast to get out of the trap by diffusing glitches around you (if you or your partner can do this, of course).\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Game was fully developed during the #<strong>OperaGXGameJam</strong> by team of Moonizmaniacs: Serhiy Shyryayev (aka JokeSlinger) and Denys Kupets (aka retroshaper).\r\n</p>\n<p>We are a duet of passionate generalists united in our goals to build fun and thought-provoking games.\r\n</p>\n<p>JokeSlinger:\r\n</p>\n<p>Game Design\r\n</p>\n<p>Development</p>\n<p>retroshaper:\r\n</p>\n<p>Music and SFX\r\n</p>\n<p>GFX and effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:59:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe837782dccab460b173900c78ce026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Moonizmaniacs"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
