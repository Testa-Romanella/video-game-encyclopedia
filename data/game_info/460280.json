{"id": 460280, "slug": "malloc-quest-2", "name": "Malloc Quest 2", "name_original": "Malloc Quest 2", "description": "<p><em>The\u00a0world is left in ruins, the only path left to take, leads to an ancient labyrinth. With nothing left to lose, you step into an unknown and frightening world, carrying the hopes and dreams of your peers from a distant past. </em></p>\n<p>Malloc Quest 2 is an Rouge-lite action-rpg, heavily inspired by the likes of Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain and Burriedbornes. Your goal is to gather <strong>artifacts</strong>, acquire <strong>equipment,\u00a0</strong>to hone your <strong>skills,</strong> and to reach the top of the labyrinth to find the answers you're looking for.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This game is still in early development, many features and assets are subject to change or just placeholders for the time being. Also, a butt-ton of bugs.</em></p>\n<p>As of now there are:</p>\n<ul><li>14 Enemy types\r\n</li><li>36 usable Artifacts (49 Items in total)\r\n</li><li>10 usable set bonuses\r\n</li><li>21 usable skills (27 in total)\r\n</li><li>27 different\u00a0Status effects\r\n</li><li>16 different equipment attributes\r\n</li><li>20 different room designs</li><li>5 Contracts</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Artifacts</strong></p>\n<p>Artifacts are the cornerstone of the system and have the most influence on your playstyle. They provide powerfull bonuses in the early stages of the game and later on define your build with their series bonus (Like item sets). You are limited to 14 unique artifacts in your inventory with only 7 of them having an active effect on your character at a time. Depending on what set bonuses you get you want to adjust your equipment and skills accordingly, though in certain situations you may want to adjust your artifacts to your skills or equipment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skills</strong></p>\n<p>Skills are special\u00a0abilities\u00a0used by your character to give them an edge in a fight. They can range from simple damage abilities to magic attacks, heal or utility spells. While the spells you currently can obtain are random, you can influence the skill/s your character starts with, with a contract.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contracts</strong></p>\n<p>You may or may not choose a contract before starting a run. The purpose of a contract is to reduce the randomness and stir your character into a vague direction. The mage contract let's you start with a magic spell and tends to give you magic power and increased max sp on your equipment, while the warrior contract will\u00a0favor\u00a0hp and attack damage. Currently contracts only influence the equipment you get and your start skill,\u00a0but that is subject to change once more artifacts and skills are added.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Equipment is supposed to give your character main stats and certain situational abilities. Equipment has higher scaling in the later stages of the game, but you may only hold 2\u00a0Equipment\u00a0(1 Weapon and 1\u00a0Accessory) at a time. Changing your equipment may result in a drastic power difference and the unique passive abilities can lead to very different runs even when using the same build multiple times.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T06:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a86f80723d52b32cf34d71479e2d1e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trytomatie"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
