By spending a dash unit, propel yourself in the desired direction, follow up with a smash, and send the puck back into the opponent's zone.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Smash and Super-smash</strong></li></ul>by holding down the dedicated button, you can send the puck back with increased force. The longer you hold, the more powerful the smash becomes, reaching its peak as it transforms into a super-smash.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Mega-smash</strong></li></ul>Each player has a mega-smash gauge that fills up with each collection of an energy orb on their color slot or by performing a smash (a super-smash further fills the gauge).<br/><br/>The race for the mega-smash becomes a true battle; each smash or super smash increases your gauge while decreasing your opponent's. When the gauge reaches its maximum, the super-smash transforms into a mega-smash, allowing you to project the puck devastatingly towards one of the goals.<br/><br/>Although the mega-smash moves at a high speed, countering it by executing a well-timed smash is not impossible. Succeeding in this maneuver will completely fill your gauge by retrieving your opponent's mega-smash. <br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Special Orb</strong></li></ul>Gain the upper hand during the match by seizing special orbs. At regular intervals, a special orb appears. If you collect it, it can grant you a temporary advantage, such as increasing your movement speed or slowing down your opponent's.<br/><br/>However, be cautious, as it can sometimes bring surprises and turn against you.<br/><br/><br/>Immerse yourself in nostalgia with the retro filter mode that simulates the effect of old arcade cabinet screens.
