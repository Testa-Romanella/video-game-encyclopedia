You can then spend what you&#39;ve found on new miners, machines and boosts\u2013 and that&#39;s just the beginning! With the help of Colonel Flint (who&#39;s much more than an ordinary chimpanzee), you can explore your Galaxy and search for new resources to mine! Reach the farthest corners of the universe by buying space probes and leveling them up. The galaxy is yours to explore!<br />\nBut wait, there&#39;s more! Wormholes will let you move from galaxy to galaxy where you will discover uncharted planets and resource rich moons! Who knows, maybe one day you will be able to conquer Trappist-1!<br />\nBut be careful! The universe holds ugly surprises as well. You will have to defend your ground from terrible aliens. Don&#39;t let them stop you on your intergalactic quest!<br />\nStart mining now to grow your Main Colony... turn it into the largest in the universe! The potential is endless!<br />\nHave fun with the new 3D touch feature which lets you enhance the power of your laser beam in battle mode! Big fan of Tap Galaxy?
