This is my entry for the RPG Maker Jam #3, titled\u00a0<strong>CONTAGION</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTAGION</strong> is a combat-heavy game based on surviving attrition. Your enemies are not particularly tough, but healing in this game is sparse, so even small amounts of damage can build up over time. Thankfully, you have an ace up your sleeve -- your enemies will signal their intent before you decide your actions, letting you react to what lies ahead.</p>\n<p>While the game jam was for 72 hours, I managed to squeeze this game out in just about 20 hours, thanks to a busier-than-expected weekend. My lovely wife contributed maps, but the rest of the game is built by me (using some resources and DLC, please see credits.txt!) I wish I could have spent more time tuning the balance and mechanics and working out the bugs; but that's the nature of game jams =)</p>\n<p>Good luck to everyone in the jam! I hope to play your games soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e922e98e3efa3dbfd446a5d3730231a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BadMinotaur"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
