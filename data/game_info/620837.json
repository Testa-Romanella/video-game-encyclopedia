The theme for the jam was \"joined together\", which this project fits in two ways!\u00a0First: you join and re-join mechanisms using your grappling hook.\u00a0Second: the grappling hook joins together movement and environment interaction!</p>\n<p>Controls are typical: AWSD to move (W jumps, S crouches), left click to fire grappling hook. Hold left click to be pulled towards the hook. If your hook hits a mechanism, you'll swap wires with it, allowing you to open and close gates and disable security cameras. The goal of each level is to get to the *beautiful*\u00a0checkered flag at the other end. Don't ask me why this mysterious location has flags and such everywhere...</p>\n<p>I\u00a0was able to make 9 levels. The first few introduce grappling and various mechanisms, while the last two are \"challenge levels\"\u00a0:) If I\u00a0had a bit more time, I\u00a0could've made more to explore the interesting interactions this system can provide, but it's almost 6am... such is life.</p>\n<p>PS. The protagonist is small... but you will see that he has a beeg heart &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:28:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9da/9dafd2819988ca322d86ef2595cf0b4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GabrielRStella"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
