[: In this game I put ideas into action that have accompanied me since my teenage years &amp; have now become reality.</p>\n<p>Graphics (apart from facesets &amp; backgrounds), music &amp; story are made by me again.</p>\n<p>In this concoction I celebrate the cartoons &amp; the music of the 90s &amp; Americana. I also wanted to promote the Artbreeder website with the backgrounds &amp; facesets. [;</p>\n<p>The focus of this thing is on humor &amp; very far-fetched puzzles.
