Now go deal with it</p>\n<p>The game is a sidescroller with a bunch of different mechanics which you slowly lose because of corruption. The corruptions are random so each run is going to be unique. Also there are some combos, movement techniques and secrets which arent obvious, try figuring them out!</p>\n<p>I was really tight on time but I think it turned out pretty nice, hope you enjoy it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T12:27:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c5/4c572b12635fcf3493e21d27fabbfcd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Timure_noffty"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
