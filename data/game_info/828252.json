If the characters change the world will fall into chaos. But do not worry. Even if that happens, you can manage it. Because the fundamental structures never change. BUT even if the fundamental structures change, what happens?</p>\n<p>Group Group is a puzzle game in which you attack your opponent by merging two elements according to the rules.</p>\n<p>A player who makes another opponent's hearts run out, or with more hearts at the end of all turns wins.</p>\n<p>Each game has 9 turns and two players will choose how to merge on their own turn.</p>\n<p>The control is really simple. Just drag an element to the right or the left, so merge it with an element on the right side or the left side.</p>\n<p>Each game can have different elements.</p>\n<p>Each game has a rule board. The rule board has an order of 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each board can have different elements or different structures, but the fundamental abstract structures are the same.</p>\n<p>Each game has a 3x3 bingo board with numbers 1-9 in random order.</p>\n<p>If three elements of the same color are collected in lines on the bingo board, the winner of that turn or, in the case of a draw, the operator of the turn will get an advantage. But if three different colors are collected then it will give a disadvantage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T17:25:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92f/92f6036630285dacbbed240ec4e7ff37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phortion"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
