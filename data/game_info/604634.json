You must explore an old abandoned factory to find the key to give robots emotions, left behind\u00a0by your creator as a parting gift. During your travels, you can choose to self-destruct to ward off attackers, allowing you extra agility due to the lesser weight and allowing you to take shortcuts through the level. Or, you can remain intact and take a slower but safer route to the end goal. Will you chance death and complete levels as just a head, or will you play it safe and risk the whole factory coming down on your still-intact body?\u00a0The choice is yours...</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: There is currently no reward or punishment for completion time because the TrinityGamesDev programmer procrastinated the heck out of this project. Sorry.</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow\u00a0Keys to move and Jump (You can also use the Space Bar)</p>\n<p>Be advised that the Web version is a bit buggy, so it is advised that you play the desktop versions for best performance. Actually, the game is pretty glitchy and unfinished in general because it was programmed entirely over the course of one day, so there was little time for testing or polishing. There is a known glitch in the end where some lag may start to pop up and the game will not end when it should; until this is fixed, please just close the game window if the game does not take you back to the main menu on completion of the final level.\u00a0Thanks for your understanding!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Trinity Games for Music, Art, Programming, etc. (Everything)</p>\n<p>Please don't use our artwork or code.</p>\n<p>EH: Art and Character Design/Animator\u00a0</p>\n<p>JH: Programmer/Level Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d46666d2f666f930883b9ba7635cca5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["TrinityGamesDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
