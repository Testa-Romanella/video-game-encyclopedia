Recently, I have noticed that in the Indie market, it seems to a be a lot more efficient to develop replay-able game such as roguelikes or arcade games and thus I have decided to shift my design choices in that direction. Deflect is my first Arcade/Rogue-like-ish game so I was able to learn quite a bit, especially on how to utilize my resources fully such as graphics, music and time.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Free BGM \"Power of Rhythm\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Composition (Arrangement) Song: FLASH \u2606 BEAT\r\n</p>\n<p>DOVA-SYNDROME Download:\u00a0https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play13104.html</p>\n<p>License :\u00a0https://dova-s.jp/_contents/license/\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Art:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kenney Simple Space + A couple of my own additions</p>\n<p>Inspirations:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paper Planet -\u00a0https://store.steampowered.com/app/1504250/Paper_Planet/</p>\n<p>Orbiters -\u00a0https://kalechipps.itch.io/orbiters</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T15:23:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d477d4c0bef90f5a2869c827fb58c10e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheJourneyOfE"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
