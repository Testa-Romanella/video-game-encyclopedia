This program allows you to change certain variables to create different randomly generated maps.\u00a0 Take screen shots, share with your friends or use it as the bases for a DnD game. I hope to add more functionality with time. Enjoy!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Help Desk:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hello, I am here to help!</p>\n<p>Reset - resets the entire grid, all data will disappear into the ether.</p>\n<p>Randomness - Poorly worded variable that turns off the chances of not spawning a tile. You will get a map of hexagons made up of hexagons.</p>\n<p>Sprawl - Right now it is not doing anything.</p>\n<p>Size - The max number of tiles per continent.</p>\n<p>Concentration - This is the real meat of the program. Here you will change the max distance from the root tile too spawn, The higher the number the more likely you will have tiles spawn, giving you a hexagon of hexagon (What Randomness does).</p>\n<p>Sprawl amount - Right now does not do anything of note, let me know if you find some interesting findings adjusting it :).</p><p>For all add and minus input hold z and you can decrease and increase by 10. What ever you do don't go below zero yet ;).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Developer and Designer - Austin Meyer\u00a0https://twitter.com/home</p>\n<p>Tiles by -\u00a0https://cuddlyclover.itch.io/fantasy-hex-tiles\u00a0(go donate)</p>\n<p>Wanderer by -\u00a0Andre Mari Coppola https://opengameart.org/content/toens-medieval-strategy-sprite-pack-v10-16x16</p>\n\n<p><strong>Super Special Thanks!</strong></p>\n<p>Amir Rajan, find him here\u00a0https://twitter.com/amirrajan</p>\n<p>The entire DragonRuby Discord, these folks are the bomb!</p>\n<p>My Fiance and Family<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T03:33:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/706/706b90042008a00921cdb6861e9a5b68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Niyy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
