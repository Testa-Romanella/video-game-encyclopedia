Wreak chaos and improve your character as you move at break-neck speed. <br/><br/>------<h3>Switch between alternate dimensions at will</h3><br/>As you are torn between the fractures of reality, you can switch between The Top and The Alt. <br/>The Top has your \u201cnormal\u201d reality with flying, deadly robots, and people in suits trying to kill you, but also has the rewards and objectives. The Alt is a darker, deadlier version of the top with corrupted zombies and the Neon Stringler trying to kill you, but you can regain health and reposition from The Top there. Use them both to achieve your goals.<h3>Wallrun, double jump and slide around in procedural levels</h3><br/>Every game mode requires the need to use your advanced movement and your dimension switching abilities. Raid the ever-changing city and cause chaos. But if you're not fast enough, you'll find chaos upon you too!<h3>Use either a gun or a melee weapon</h3><br/>Each are fit for a different playstyle, with their own Temporary Boosts you can find across the map. Bonk/shoot your enemies to death!<h3>Buy permanent boosts with the coins you find</h3><br/>In every combat game mode you can find coins as a reward, either for your speed or ability to survive long enough. Use them to buy permanent boosts and improve your chances of survival.<br/><br/><strong><h3>To summarize, IDIOTIC has:</h3></strong><br/><ul><li> Alternate dimensions (only one is called The Alt though)<br/></li><li> Stupid Weapons<br/></li><li> Fun movement<br/></li><li> High pace<br/></li><li> Low IQ</li></ul><br/><br/>Made by a noob solo developer that tries his hardest.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T04:57:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/188/18887308f44ee2129482b299b826cc3c.jpg", "website": "https://ayen11.github.io/Idiotic-Website-02/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 242, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emanuel N.M"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
