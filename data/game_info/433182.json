{"id": 433182, "slug": "body-crisis", "name": "Body Crisis", "name_original": "Body Crisis", "description": "<p>Your organs are unstable and may stop working at any time, causing then to lose health rapidly. It is your job, then, to restore them to full health by correctly using the corresponding input for each organ (described below).\u00a0</p><p>Each individual task is relatively easy to execute, but don\u2019t underestimate the capacity to be overwhelmed. If any organ health reaches zero it fails and you lose the game. You can start over from the beginning of the same level though. There are 6 levels in total.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Heart</strong>: press SPACE right when the inner circle is close to filling (you can use the sound cue to help).</p>\n<p><strong>Lungs</strong>: hold LEFT MOUSE BUTTON to fill the bar and release it when the bar reaches the blue zone. Avoid staying at the red zone.</p>\n<p><strong>Brain</strong>: use the MOUSE WHEEL to keep the marker inside the white zone.</p>\n<p><strong>Guts</strong>: draw circles with your MOUSE. The more circles you complete, the faster the organ heals.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Echoes of Time v2 by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link:\u00a0https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3698-echoes-of-time-v2<br/>License:\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6a6e4577abcb6b4f9e5095308ff61c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Memento Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
