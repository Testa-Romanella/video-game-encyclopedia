There's a lot of things I'm not happy about with this game, but I'm glad I actually submitted something.</p><p>It started of as a reimagining of the 3 vikings with shapeshifting, but that didn't quite stick. Instead you get a tale of injustice and revenge, as portrayed by silent primitive shapes.</p><p>There's a couple of physics glitches that I haven't been able to figure out in the time I have left, mostly involving the ball. If you find yourself unable to jump, change to any shape, then change back to fix it.</p><p>Tools used:<br/>Unity<br/>Paint.NET<br/>Bfxr<br/>Font for title and message text was Bloody - http://www.dafont.com/bloody.font</p><p>Desktop version: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9HGTEp2YQW2MjJmZHlaNldxamM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74fc2e994fd596a060d5cd7c5020d0db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Been"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
