Throw your trusty petards around the level with <strong>left click</strong> and detonate them with your <strong>shift key or right click</strong>. If you wait too long they'll explode on their own! Propel yourself towards the green squares to be whisked away to the next level.</p>\n<p>I had all the best intentions of starting this two weeks ago, but as per usual I waited until the final weekend! The asset department is definitely lacking this time around.</p>\n<p>If you're interested, the source code can be found on github.</p><p>Unfortunately there's a rather ugly bug that breaks keyboard input if you click off of the game after beginning play. If you switch tabs and resume trying to play you'll still be able to use left and right click to player the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f6/6f6f5a68a890d309ad96a45845681aa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Kubik"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
