This is all done by taking a series of Turns, to either Add Tokens to a Shared Pool, which sets up dynamic interpersonal scenes or Take Tokens, which can lead to bombastic action! Each playbook is uniquely designed to effect the game and other players in a myriad of ways which means no two games will be the same! Alongside the new playbooks, the game also introduces new mechanics like\u00a0<strong>collectible gear, a game clock and more!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is a must have game for any Tokusatsu fan whose every wanted to create their own Rider concepts.\r\n</p>\n<p>This PDF includes all 6 playbooks, instructions on how to play &amp; how to narrate a game, a Monster creation table and all Gear Cards needed for play.\u00a0<strong>Please note that while this is a hack of<em>\u00a0Henshin!
