They make faces naturally, but I have to make a conscious decision each time I move a muscle.</em><br/><br/><em>Every morning I go to the bathroom to rehearse what my face is going to show today.</em>\n</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Life\u2019s never been easy for William, but today is special \u2013 a girl named\u00a0<strong>Tanya Kennedy</strong>\u00a0suddenly goes missing and the only thing Will's friends know \u2013 he was the one to see her last.<br/><br/>Will you remain secretive and make William act as though nothing happened, or will you let true emotions show through his mask?<br/><br/>In Who's Lila, a specifically trained face-recognizing neural network allows you to make this choice! In dialogue, instead of choosing a text option, input facial expressions by moving parts of the character\u2019s face. The neural network will then analyze the emotion and output the result, thus progressing the plot.</p>\n<p>Apart from the struggles provided by your own face, you will be met with a gritty dither-punk world of Who\u2019s Lila. Prepare yourself for dream-like landscapes, surreal architecture, steam-filled factory interiors, and David Lynch-inspired beauty of the industrial and the mundane.\r\n</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\r\n\u00abSometimes there is fear in the unknown, but we are good detectives and we have to know everything\u00bb\r\n<p>________________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<em>David Lynch</em>\n<p>Will you make sense of this strange story, or will you lose yourself in the beautiful mystery?
