As the book says,\" Natural selection, survival of the fittest, survival of the fittest This is the law of life that nature cannot escape, the conquest of the inferior by the dominant race! \"The creative inspiration of the game also comes from this. <br/></li><li>In my vision, games should be creative, creative, not just known creatures. It should be unique, fanciful, magical. So, prehistoric creatures, ancient creatures, eastern and western mythical creatures. appear in my mind. </li></ul><h3>Introduction: </h3><ul><li>\"living space and food are limited, so creatures must fight for survival.\" There are variants in individuals in the same population, favorable variants that adapt to the environment will survive, and unfavourable variants will be eliminated. If the change of natural conditions is directional, in the process of history, after a long period of natural selection, the small variation will accumulate and become a significant variation, which may lead to the formation of subspecies and new species. \"<br/></li><li>there is a variety of competitions between creatures, and in the continuous competitive killing, creatures will gradually absorb the characteristics of other life forms to complete their own genes. Another evolution. In the game, we use the acquisition of skills and the acquisition of models to transform the form of the selected creature and inherit it. <br/></li><li>The core of the whole game was born, and we call it the \"evolution\" and \"metamorphosis\" of living things.</li></ul><br/><br/>Core play: <br/><ul><li>different creatures have different uniqueness, so we give them a unique form of attack. <br/></li><li>Nature is made up of various elements, so we give them attribute magic. In this case, a unique complete creature is created. </li></ul><br/><ul><li><strong>Evolution:</strong> in the process of biological reevolution, skills have additional effects. <br/></li><li><strong>Metamorphosis: </strong>with the improvement of the level of life, organisms will gradually change to a higher form.</li></ul><h3>Roguelike play: </h3>at present, we focus on processing the single-machine play of the game. Added the roguelike attribute. In standalone play, each creature is an optional character for the player, and it is also the BOSS. for the level Creatures have their own specific environmental survival map, using cross-border play. When you choose the creature to clear the customs, there will be a different reward. Such as: unlock the character, unlock the map, unlock props and so on.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Props random: </strong>each level will have different props random appearance, high-quality props can bring players and easy customs experience. Biological <br/></li><li><strong>randomness: </strong>with the progress of biological unlock, players will encounter more and more species of monsters at each level, and different monsters will lead to the diversification of skill sets.<br/></li><li><strong>Talent random: </strong>customs awards can be used to extract talent, talent can not be specified can only be obtained at random, but can choose the match of talent on the field.</li></ul><h3>Other ways of playing:</h3><ul><li><strong>tactics: </strong>there are all kinds of grass stacks in the game, which can be used for biological concealment. No one can find any of the creatures in the grass stack. In the early stages of life, you can also use individual size to hide from weeds or woods.<br/></li><li><strong>Strategy: </strong>skill choices are important, with all creatures having only three skill choices. There is a combination of different skills, and multiple skills also produce set attributes. So that creatures can gain greater advantages in the game. <br/></li><li><strong>Talent:</strong> each creature has two kinds of talents, each of which can carry a talent skill. So the match and choice between talent and skills will be very good at the beginning of the game. It helps. <br/></li><li><strong>Set: </strong>skills are divided into two categories, skills can be combined with each other to activate skill additional features, more than 4 skills to meet the conditions can activate skill sets.</li></ul><h3>Future Plan: </h3><ul><li><strong>genetic Evolution Plan: </strong>80% of the game has completed the core content of the description. After previous tests, we found that the acquisition of the model will lead to the birth of very strange and unacceptable creatures, so we optimize this and process to present players with aesthetic genetic combinations. Because of the ability of team art, we can not complete 20% of this part in a short time, so the completion degree of core content is 80%. <br/></li><li><strong>Competitive Game Plan: </strong>for a competitive game, the current content is enough for players to choose their own creatures to compete on a map. But we prefer you to be able to In a very perfect network environment, so that players will not appear Catton, so the way of playing online competition has been temporarily delayed by us. <br/></li><li><strong>Skill Random Plan:</strong> each BOSS is not a fixed skill, they will randomly bring a very special final skill, this skill is very good to be vigilant. And we increase the unique end skills of different species, which can produce the pleasure of a blow when used properly. <br/></li><li><strong>Multiplayer networking Program:</strong> we will learn from Adventure 2 in the Rain to increase the fun of multiplayer online. Genetic metamorphosis plan: prepare to hide the metamorphosis level, when certain conditions are reached, can To transform into a perfect period, and the biological model of this period is defined by the player himself.<br/></li><li><strong>Map plan: </strong><br/></li><li><ul><li>1, competitive map we will optimize to the planet way map, and add the unique attribute of the planet, this attribute will affect the creature itself in the future; <br/></li><li><li>2, stand-alone map: at present, due to the time problem, the number of our maps is not much, but we will strive to achieve that each kind of creature has more than 5 maps, so as to ensure that the player will not be too monotonous in the game process; </li></li></ul></li><li><strong>Biological Program:</strong> at present, I divide organisms into three categories (omnivorous, carnivorous, herbivorous) and four subcategories (mutated creatures, ancient times). Creatures, demonic creatures, sacred creatures); In the future, we will also increase the variety of creatures, such as: mountain and Sea Classic Biology, mythological.<br/></li><li><strong>Biological Editor Program: </strong>this project is really the future, but it is also what I finally hope to achieve, players can get a variety of biological genetic components in the game, using the biological editor to complete the transformation of the biological shape, making it a very cool and unique original creature.</li></ul><h3>The author's vision: </h3><ul><li>the ultimate goal is to make the Law of Life a game in single-machine mode, collaborative mode for a variety of genetic components collection, achievement unlock, background story explanation; in competitive mode, the use of collected genetic components to other players to cause unexpected \"surprises.\"<br/></li><li>At present, this project is funded by me personally, and three small partners with common wishes and hobbies are formed to perfect and develop the game. However, due to financial and time issues, we need people to recognize the idea of the game while supporting us to improve the game. <br/></li><li>Due to manpower and time problems, but also led to a variety of BUG, a lot of BUG we are relatively clear, but need to be repaired step by step, I hope you can understand before the purchase, please give us time to grow up</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T02:18:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe0f57f72b75c8e16299151d60780334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AmazingCattle"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AmazingCattle"], "esrb_rating": null}
