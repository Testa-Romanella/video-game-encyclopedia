{"id": 855875, "slug": "alternate-fire", "name": "Alternate Fire", "name_original": "Alternate Fire", "description": "<p>original description: Alternate Fire is a puzzle game where you must use your items in multiple ways. The items are affected by the temperature of the room, which changes when you go through the starting door. But what's in your inventory won't change. If you mess up, walk through the door again when everything is hot to reset the room back to the start. Get to the end if you can.<br/>(oh an all the art is mine. I only remembered to credit the stuff that isn't mine in the credits)<br/></p>\n<p>Alternate Fire is a single screen puzzle game (the game itself is one screen, there's more for menus). Wood to charcoal, sand to glass, water to lava, and more must be worked with to go through the door on the other side. Using the arrow keys to move, and Z and click to interact with objects will help you use and sometimes reuse items in different ways to get the key and unlocked the door on the other side of the river.</p>\n<p>You will enter into a nice grassy area when starting the game, but walking through the door at the start will heat the room up, changing what has been left behind. Whatever you kept in your inventory when walking through the door will not be changed by the heat however. But if you messed something up, walking through the door will reset the place to the beginning, though now you'll have more information.</p>\n<p>This was my first game published and my first game jam as a solo creator (I was on a team as an artist in the past, but that was it) Plus it seems the screen that was to play when you walked through the locked door does not work, but as long as you can walk through that door, you won.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:06:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69e/69ebd36e2fd740f90da8c698aefdd2c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Causemufins"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
