I like ASCII style games and it's my first 'actual' game, so it will probably not be very good, but I will try my best. :)</p>\n<p>Q: How does this game play?</p>\n<p>A: This game's movement controls are\u00a0pretty similar to Rogue (1980), but the controls with other parts of the game are still TBD.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the download named game.exe? That's quite sketchy...</p>\n<p>A: It is quite sketchy, but I haven't figured out a better way to do this yet, so for now it'll have to be sketchy.</p>\n<p>(To clear things up: the game is compiled using GCC and the .exe file that you download is the compiled application)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T08:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ece/eceda4854d5f6911f38ba69c50059df8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["clonts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
