After the end of the day, each partner gives a quick assessment on how well the other partner achieved those goals. You both then review the results and end the day. Merit points are given to your partner based upon how well they achieved those goals. Merit Badges are also earned as you gain Merit Points. Results and progress are carried on to the next day and throughout the week. Each week, you are given 3 new goals to achieve daily for 4 weeks in total. The assessment and review only takes a few minutes each day and is very simple to complete. The development can also continue long after the 4 week goal is achieved. All progress can be saved.<h3>\ud83d\udc6b Weekly Assessment: </h3><br/><br/>\ud83d\udc95At the end of seven days of your daily challenges, you and your partner will be given a weekly assessment. Each evaluation session is a few minutes. You and your partner each respond to a series of phrases through several response options. You then review each other\u2019s responses and then conclude the session with discussions or silent reflection. Each private session can last 5-15 minutes. The complete couple's session can last from 30 minutes to an hour. Once the weekly assessment is completed, a new week is started with new Daily Challenges and goals.<h3>\ud83d\udc6b Time Involved: </h3><br/><br/>Weekly assessments are simple but can grant amazing insight for both partners to reflect upon. You both can discuss the results or can opt to not discuss the results after they have been reviewed. The option to go over areas of concern is also available. No 3rd party is ever needed.<h3>\ud83d\udc6b Merits and Rewards:</h3><br/><br/>\ud83d\udc95Merit Badges are earned through progress. Your partner\u2019s assessment of your progress determines the points earned and the badges you receive. You also in turn determine your partner\u2019s progress equally. Your perspective of your partner and your partner\u2019s perspective of you is what matters most here, not the accuracy of the assessment. This is what is reflected over time and inspires motivation on both sides. Accountability is also automatic and helps keep your progress honest and fair without any 3rd party intervention.<h3>\ud83d\udc6b Love: Interactive Therapy Features:</h3><br/><br/> \ud83d\udc96 Private &amp; confidential.
