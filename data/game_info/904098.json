How cruel! The quiet flame of hate that kindles in the heart of every\u00a0man turns out to also kindle in the hearts of toon-shaded pixel penguins. Pengu needs to make it to the top of the mountain to get his sweater back!</p>\n<ul><li>BRRR<br/>Over time, when away from a fire, Pengu gets colder. The colder he gets, the slower he moves. When he becomes too cold, the game is over.<br/>Getting hit with snowballs will severely decrease Pengu's temperature.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>S'MORES<br/>Campfires placed across the level will kindle when Pengu gets close to them. Stand near a campfire to warm up!<br/>As you make your way up the mountain, be cognizant of your coldness level! Return to campfires to warm up if you don't feel confident that you'll have enough\u00a0time to make it to the next fire. Or, if it's too late to go back, push forward fast!</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move. Hold right click to charge a snowball throw. Release to throw.
