To disable or change the timer, go to settings and edit the timer. I have placed the timer to add suspense and tension to the gameplay but the power for change is in your hands. You can also change the volume of music and volume but I highly recommend to play with volume!</p>\n<p>Follow me on\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Youtube\u00a0or Itch for more.
