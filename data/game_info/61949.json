{"id": 61949, "slug": "woodzone", "name": "WoodZone", "name_original": "WoodZone", "description": "WoodZone is a unique opportunity to become an entrepreneurial lumberjack. Imagine that you have a company that grows in front of your eyes or you go up the ladder in another corporation to eventually become the boss in it. The player has a lot of \"sandbox rakes and blades\" that open up new possibilities. Lighting in the sawmill can be built on the principle of \"put and work\", but a more demanding player can develop them using logic gates and cables. For example, it can be lit when entering the building, the place for wood is full or there is no raw materials. The game provides, among others, conveyors, computers, cameras, sensors, logic gates, cabling, vehicles, robots, construction parts and much, much more! This allows you to create excellent mechanisms that automate work: wood sorter, machine that checks the quality of wood, production efficiency meter, automatic feeder and so on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Each player gets a designated piece of land that can be freely used. Multiplayer allows you to interact with players from other parts of the world who have access to raw materials found on specific biomes. It may turn out that the start-up location does not provide the goods required for the production of desirable constructions and inventions. Demand for limited materials dynamically shapes the game market and requires players to cooperate. This cooperation can be, among other things, by setting up your own or a joint company, employing players as employees, establishing partnership agreements with other corporations, as well as acting as a freelancer. The player can be employed as a lumberjack, driver, carpenter, builder, manager and many other professions. Each field is associated with other duties and permissions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The development of the economy changes dynamically depending on the behavior of the players. The price of wood is influenced by factors such as the type, size and quality of wood, the level of processing or even the production technology. An important factor in the demand for wood is also the season of the year. The player is able to set up his own company, which he can run alone or with friends. It opens up new challenges with which it must face. The task of the corporation's owner is to expand the fleet and infrastructure, increase revenues, employ more employees, create strategies, ensure the work of others and generally work in favor of the company's development.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Wood has a long way to go before it is sold. The player can extract many different species of trees and decide on their further processing. Each type of wood has its own properties affecting the way of transport and processing.<br/>An important aspect is to take care of wood supplies, protect them from moisture and other damage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The player is forced to adhere to the basic rules regarding felling, whether or not to adhere to the rules regarding allowed sound pressure. The protagonist should also have permission for various activities and current vehicle insurance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Before going on a further journey, the player should adapt his equipment to the factors occurring in the target area, such as terrain, temperature and local conditions. Vehicles differ in dimensions, load capacity and capacity of the fuel tank.<br/>They may be damaged by inappropriate use or random failure. The protagonist can move on land, water and air.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Depending on preferences on purchased plots, the player can build his own objects for various purposes. The price of the plot depends on the area and location. Designing your own factory, sawmill, residential home, or any building is possible thanks to the modular construction system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Procedurally generated world allows you to explore different climate zones like desert, tundra, rainforests and others. The urban and industrial structures will be filled with activities developing trade and production of goods. In order to increase revenues, the player can visit hard to reach places that hide exceptionally unique tree species.<br/>Among other things, the player can find a collapsed cave which he will have to dig out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a3/3a398b10eef95ec6e798e75b6b9a1a57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeSand Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ultimate Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
