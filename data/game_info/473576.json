You can take the wheel and go wherever you like. Or take the passenger seat and watch the landscape and wildlife. There is no score or time limit to worry about. This is a virtual ride where you can just enjoy and immerse yourself in the environment. Every trip is different and the environment is infinite, so you never run out of places to explore!<br/></p>\n<p>This experience is compatible with Gear VR and Oculus Go. Contact me and I will give you a key to install it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T02:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ca/2ca67ee575c5cdd113a220b423751cc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Tubeliar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
