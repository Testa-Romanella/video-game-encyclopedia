{"id": 82595, "slug": "monkey-blockade", "name": "Monkey Blockade", "name_original": "Monkey Blockade", "description": "Monkey Blockade is a very quick-playing strategy puzzle game. Monkeys have escaped in your lab, and you need to keep them from escaping. You have a fleet of robots that will stand in their way, but the monkeys always seem to find the quickest way around. You need to plan ahead to keep your monkeys away from the edge.<br/><br/>In addition to the robots, you have a few snacks that can distract monkeys for one turn. And sometimes that one turn is the difference between capture and escape.<br/><br/>Monkey Blockade is the latest game from The Code Zone, maker of the hit games Bulldozer, Pop Pies, Meltdown, and Dice-A-Rama. Have fun, and get those monkeys!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d4b5f073d0c184b9a013db71da506ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["The Code Zone"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["The Code Zone"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
