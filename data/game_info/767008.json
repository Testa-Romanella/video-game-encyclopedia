Crops can\u2019t grow if there is weed on their patch.\r\n</p>\n<p>So make sure to prepare the ground, plant the seed, water it and keep an eye on the weed!\r\n</p>\n<p>If there is too less water or too much weed on the patch, crops won\u2019t grow and the patch will eventually disappear. It will happen in the future, but you can delay it as much as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>Try to keep always an eye on the orders to deliver the fruits needed. Otherwise you will run out of seeds soon, as it is not guaranteed that you get a seed from harvesting crops. If you run out of seeds, you loose.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Deliver your hard earned crops at the chest!</em></p>\n<p><em>This little game was made in\u00a0<strong>Godot</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Shout out to Cup Nooble to provide that awesome asset pack!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong><br/></p>\n<p>2022-05-04: Fixes bug that caused player getting stuck after smashing the interaction button a couple of times.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:49:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68dc1074cd9a1d6cbe945affede75d20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarinWin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
