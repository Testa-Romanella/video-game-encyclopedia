You may use abilities on resources any number of times. Tune your deck to more easily deal with the enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently resolutions other than 1080p are not supported. If they work that's great I haven't tested them all and most of them likely don't display properly. It's likely going to come out in the wash when I update the graphics from UI elements and remove the direction connection from the logic from to the visual representation.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>N.B.<br/></strong>Bug reporting is extremely welcome, I want to know if something weird is going on I haven't noticed. Please let me know in the comments.
