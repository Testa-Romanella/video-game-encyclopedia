{"id": 489812, "slug": "chronoventure", "name": "ChronoVenture", "name_original": "ChronoVenture", "description": "<p>ChronoVenture is a momentum-based Gameboy-style platformer shooter where the player controls a cat named Lizzy as she runs, jumps, claws and shoots her way to the end of the level where she'll encounter against a boss to unlock a new weapon or upgrade before she finds herself warping into the future.<br/>The outcome of Act 2, the future, changes depending on whether or not you completed an optional objective in Act 1, the present.</p>\n<p>This demo features:<br/>- The first playable stage, Dryforest Drought<br/>- 4 Usable Weapons<br/>- 5 Unique Enemies<br/>- 2 Bosses<br/>- 4 Green Colours<br/>- Roughly 5 Minutes of Gameplay<br/>- Classic (2-Button) and Modern (4-Button) Control Options, with Xinput Support<br/>- Authentic soundtrack and sound effects made with DefleMask Tracker<br/>- And not much else, it's a really short demo.</p>\n<p>I should clarify that this is not a real Game Boy game. This is a Windows-only game made with GameMaker: Studio that imitates to be a Game Boy game because I enjoyed playing some of those games. However, that doesn't necessarily mean I'm aiming to be hardware accurate and some modern features like widescreen support would be implemented in the future.</p>\n<p>As this game is currently under development, your feedback and constructive criticism will be invaluable on making the game better so please contact me via email (duckilous@gmail.com) and/or follow me on Twitter(@Duckilous). Thank you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:30:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcb6c5cca05163f4e865d3c622d6bc26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duckilous"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
