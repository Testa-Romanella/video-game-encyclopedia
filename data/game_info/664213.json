After some thinking I decided to remake an old windows game that I used to play with my father in my style. The actual game is called Bow and Arrow. All the pixel art was created by me, except the romans, which my brother Rafael made for my game. This game can be found at http://vodiniz.itch.io/pixel-bowmaster and at https://github.com/vodiniz/pixel_bowmaster</p>\n<p>The .exe file was made with pyinstaller.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T04:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87c/87c006d9137644b44b3ec7960fdc7157.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vodiniz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
