On PC, this happens automatically, and you gain steps as time goes on.\u00a0</li><li>As you 'walk', your cryptid will sniff out items and add them to your inventory. These items can be used to care for your cryptid by dragging them from the inventory.\u00a0</li><li>To find out how your cryptid is feeling, click on them. They'll display some emojis that let you know what type of item they need.\u00a0</li><li>You can get more items from the trader. You can also sell any unwanted items here.\u00a0</li><li>To find more cryptidz, go to the clues screen. By dragging three clues into the slots, you'll find a cryptid.\u00a0</li><li>This cryptid will then be registered in your journal. On the journal screen you can view all the cryptidz you've collected and change which cryptid you have active.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udd2e Credits \ud83d\udd2e</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Amy Stevens</li><li>Chris Jack</li><li>Emma Berry\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Kelly Mansfield\u00a0<br/>\n</li><li>Luke Owen</li></ul>\n<p><strong>\ud83c\udfa8 Assets\ud83c\udfa8</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Menu Sound FX Pack by Hitrison</li></ul>\n<ul><li>One Sly Move by Kevin MacLeod</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4168-one-sly-move</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n<ul><li>All emojis designed by\u00a0OpenMoji\u00a0\u2013 the open-source emoji and icon project.
