For Rick \n      (a.k.a. Hack) and Doug (a.k.a. Slash) this situation has become \n      personal. Especially after three friends from their martial arts gym get \n      abducted. The duo set off to the enemy's secret air fortress to sort \n      this out. These guys know all the moves, from martial arts to pro \n      wrestling throws, and they don't hesitate to use them. They\u2019re not \n      afraid of using knives, bats, and other things they find to get the job \n      done. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, when they get hurt they get angry\u2014and \n      you really don\u2019t want to mess with them then. They ignore damage and hit \n      even harder than usual! They\u2019re ready for the action. The question is: \n      are you?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
