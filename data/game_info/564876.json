We set a few goals to reach by the end of the week:<br/>- Make two player characters (fire &amp; axe), each with three cards + 9 fusion cards (with the potential of adding a third character and/or more cards per character in the future).<br/>- Make two enemies (with the potential to add more in the future). The presentation and AI of the enemy attacks wound up very basic, as we decided at the start that we should prioritise the player side of things.<br/>- A compendium of cards that the player has discovered (this will appear in the main menu after your first match).<br/>- A <em>sufficient </em>level of polish.</p>\n<p>Known bug: beating the game by defeating the final enemy with burn damage causes a crash, so try not to do that.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:35:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e4/2e4ea33aed99f95deda39d1527ed55bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Binky", "Nenetl", "Coldchips", "ZeethTho"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
