Getting in was easy enough, but now you need to get out with the tank you stole. Your Spacecraft is able to phase through the human barriers, but the Tank isn't. And to make matters worse, the humans installed anti-Space technology\u00a0\"Spikes\" throughout your escape route. Try to get to the end of the Level, so you can deliver the Tank, complete the Task for the Space President and make your Space Mom proud.</p>\n<p>_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD -\u00a0Move the UFO\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2fb9685f9719fefb910da1d60aa1d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TwentyEightOps"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
