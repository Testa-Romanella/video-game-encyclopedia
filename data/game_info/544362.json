Mesen should \u00a0be a good choice for it.<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>This may be the most simplest stuff that NESMAKER can make but i\u00b4m still glad to be able to make a real NES game like that. While i already have a pc version of Mr.Potato i always had the NES in mind while making it. And now i was able to.</p>\n<p>There\u00b4s still a lot.. and i mean a LOT, that i don\u00b4t know about making games in NESMAKER, which means i had to change some stuff from the original version. Since i don\u00b4t know how to use keys in my game yet i had to change the level design a bit to make it work without them. The level graphic is mainly taken from the original and has just been changed to conform to NES limitations. The sprites on the other hand were too big to be easiliy adapted, so i had to redraw them. The cooking hats still need some animations, maybe i\u00b4ll do that at a later time, or maybe in another project. I still haven\u00b4t figured out why the standard enemy is changing colors over time.. all music and sound is from the tutorial assets that come with NESMAKER, making my own music and sound is going to take a while, but i\u00b4m at least going to try that for my next NES project.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T03:51:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649b2eb0a468ca7b8769808444e97728.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crazy duck games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
