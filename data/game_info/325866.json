I succesfully completed this and while its not perfect and made my actual game worse I am thankful for the knowledge even if the implementation is very inefficient.(It uses a* if anyone wants to see it let me know).</p>\n<p><strong>AUDIO: There are sound effects but not footsteps and no bg music</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS: The controls are: Right Click to shoot(not left from bug), Dash is space, wasd moving, \"E\" to interact with shop and win port,\u00a0and \"R\" for Reloading.</strong></p>\n<p>Idea: You are a Cyborg attacking a sci-fi facility in which enemies inhabit.</p>\n<p>Theme Implementation: While it is a bit weak, it still works. I created a data Terminal (or shop )in which since you are a Cyborg, you connect to it or plug in to interact. (Although it lacks the animation). Also, at the end in the \"boss room\" there is a interactive data terminal that extracts your data from the facility and you win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a128d21e5bf4f374f05fc4c45900b1d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["c0d3d"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
