The main character Dalila has been murdered and must fight her way back from the underworld. Dalila is very fearful, so she's getting more afraid the longer she is close to those pesky birds. But once her fear has overwhelmed her, she can unleash a powerful scream or burst which will rid her of the birds and clear her way onward.</p>\n<p>Do Panic was created for Mini Jam 92 with the theme of death and the limitation of your health being your weapon. In our case it's her mental health in the form of fear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:53:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/6463ace4be3ac49efcc3749a357478b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tadpole, Esquire"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
