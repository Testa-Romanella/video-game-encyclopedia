It will feature a complete graphical overhaul and a brand new horror experience separate from the base project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\n<p><em>Midnight Shift</em>\u00a0puts players in the role as an ordinary security guard for a mannequin storage facility. At the end of a seemingly ordinary shift, strange things begin to happen in the facility.\u00a0Leaving won't be easy as the keys required for the exit doors have been misplaced.</p>\n<p><strong>Development</strong></p>\n<p>This was my first Unity project I created during my time at\u00a0Edmonton Digital Arts College.\u00a0The project was created in eight weeks with little prior coding experience. This short horror experience can be considered a\u00a0prequel to the more recent (and superior) project,\u00a0<em>Urbex</em>.</p>\n<p>View my other works:\u00a0md-pd.weebly.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26ccd612ab0ff0bd3e9dabd04e6735fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phantom"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
