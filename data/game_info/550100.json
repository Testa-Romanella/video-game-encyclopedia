Many have fallen trying to find their way amidst the insurmountable darkness of The Vord. So long as the Hex King has the soul of the land in his grasp, no peace shall be known. Countless brave heroes have thrown themselves into the realms of chaos, yet the cold life sucking darkness remains. Arash Hay'k, a descendent of the Legendary Arrow Knights of Ull'r has stepped forward in an attempt to bring peace back to a land devoid of hope.</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0made this game as a submission into the Global Game Jam 2021. While I\u00a0typically like\u00a0 to work in a team, I\u00a0arrived late to this jam and had some difficulty finding one. So I\u00a0decided to utilize the Corgi Engine and spend my two days creating art assets. The theme this year is Lost and Found. I\u00a0took up archery during the pandemic and found it rather frustrating to lose so many arrows when first starting out.\u00a0 I\u00a0suppose this game is meant to emulate that feeling to a certain degree.\u00a0 The functionality of the game is a bit buggy as I\u00a0am not much of a coder, but I\u00a0feel it gets the point across.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A - Left</p>\n<p> D - Right</p>\n<p> Space - Jump</p>\n<p> Hold Shift - Run</p>\n<p>I - Inventory</p>\n<p>Hold down Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>Left Click - move through dialogue </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T04:24:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353fb61960d4b3ed6659d2ed1779ad02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IllusiveCenter"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
