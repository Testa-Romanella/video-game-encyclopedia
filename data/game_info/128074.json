Train a parrot to say new words in Story mode. Race against the clock in Arcade Mode. And try to get your highest score in Zen Mode.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the 2 Colours game jam.</p><p>I hope you enjoy \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>***Note to 2 Colours Jammers***</p>\n<p>The Camera in this game runs through a threshold filter, contrast filter, additive grain, then finally a latched pixelator which can only output black or white pixels. The final image is not anti-aliased and so should be pure black and white pixels only.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the dialogue bar in story mode would just disappear if I used any screen space filtering on it so it is anti-aliased and not latched to black and white. I understand that this is against the game jam rules and you may judge my game accordingly.</p><p>*** Windows build uploaded the 23/7/18 identical to OSX build ***</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>- Mow</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef7398a511404f83a76b0fc7e3679628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mow"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
