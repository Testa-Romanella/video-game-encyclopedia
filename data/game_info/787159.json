It's more of a tech demo than anything else right now. My main goal going forward\u00a0is to figure out how I can make it so the maze is continuous, and maybe do something about the awkward movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T15:05:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/019/0197fe776aea396b26dee6876a2dd099.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anonymous John"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
