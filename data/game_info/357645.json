This is a year of work so far, but it's definitely not done.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is currently for absolutely free due to a few illegal assets still being used as placeholders (mostly music, plus some item sprites). The game eventually might cost something if it actually goes anywhere worth it.<br/></p>\n<p>Up to four players can play locally. There is a single-player mode which will eventually have a story, a battle mode, and a challenge (time trial) mode. While all the characters look like exactly the same guy, they do have different stats. Experiment with them! They need to be balanced.<br/></p>\n<p>Report any bugs, glitches, suggestions, or complaints to redaun.amarien@gmail.com.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:19:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a149019960baf2a248ed217eca739c24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redaun"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
