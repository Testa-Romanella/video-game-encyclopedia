Try out this new concept for an unexplored genre, the rules are simple and play sessions are super short!</p>\n<strong>How to Play</strong>\n<p>The goal of the game is simple: bring the three diamond indicators inside a colored safe area before the time for the turn runs out to deal damage to the enemy wizard! If you don't make it in time, though, you'll get 1 point of damage instead. Can you manage to beat all 3 bosses?</p>\n<p>To play, just hover or tap on a card to preview the effect it would have when played. Then play the right cards as fast as you can, by just dragging them up! If you feel like nothing in your hand works, use your Wizard Power once per turn to mulligan your hand and have a fresh start. That's all, try Magicard now!</p>\n<p><strong>Note: best played with sound on!</strong></p>\n\r\nDeveloped by:\r\n<p>\u2022 Alberto Giudice</p>\n<p>\u2022 Tibor Fekete</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T15:09:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b12/b12f32c169e9a06d7458853765b410c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Sparkolo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
