{"id": 402887, "slug": "projectfly", "name": "Project:Fly", "name_original": "Project:Fly", "description": "<p>Project:Fly is a 2D, one-button game where you fly a plane from one landing strip to another in each of the 30 masterfully crafted levels. You will go through narrow tunnels, flip and roll through winding and curvy overhangs, and scale high cliffs. It\u2019s really fun.</p>\n<p>The game has only one control input: Touch and hold literally anywhere on the screen to accelerate and pitch upwards (at the same time). This is actually more of a difficulty than simplicity. Seriously, you will crash a lot. But as you get used to how it works, it gets easier, we promise.\r\n  </p>\n<p>There are three stars in each level. You need to collect some in each level to unlock other levels. Don\u2019t worry about them though, you can always go back to the previous levels to collect more stars if you need to.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:03:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/403/403f21f2ce85f67282e4897bef22e2ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rokolix"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
