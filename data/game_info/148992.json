Meanwhile,\u00a0there's not nearly enough homes to care for Arizona's most precious treasure. Add to this, a large number of kids with special developmental or medical needs. The result? 13,111 foster kids eagerly waiting a permanent home in Maricopa County.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In Happy Homes, you'll take on the role of a social worker facing not only what seems like a never-ending flow of children in need of homes but also a deadline. The game gives you 60 seconds to place as many kids as possible in a \"happy home\". Keep in mind, not every house accepts every child.\u00a0In reality, social workers must balance children's needs with the capacities of available foster homes while also working as quickly as possible to find children a loving and lasting home.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1b/b1bf023af36210dd410916e032f74eee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nmiel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
