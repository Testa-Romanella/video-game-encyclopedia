The game wasn't finished due to burnout while making it, but I still had fun. In Factory Defense you are an intern who is in the factory when the robots have revolted. Your job is to destroy the robots by activating traps (denoted by warning signs) with your wrench. The robots are attempting to take you out, so avoid them!</p><p>Gameplay video:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yND4uDYIwmQ</p>\n<p>Shenanijam stuff: I based on the theme Wrenches 101.
