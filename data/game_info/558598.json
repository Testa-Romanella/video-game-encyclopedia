We were\u00a0too, so we made one. Work cooperatively to fight monsters that are individually assigned to you at the beginning of each match in standard mode, fight it out against zombies in survival mode, or if you feel so inclined, do both at  the same time. The game is designed to be a fun party couch co-op experience while keeping as many traditional horror game elements as possible. I didn't take it as far as I planned to, but its still a lot of fun to play with friends!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T06:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09e/09ede51819cc850ce00647eb3238e60d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeWolfe Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
