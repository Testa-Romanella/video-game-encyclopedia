In fact, while developing the game, I came up with quite a few ideas to add that could turn it into a bigger game, but that might happen if I decide to make a sequel, or a 'deluxe version'.</p>\n<p>To play, just use the arrow keys, scaping the zombies and the traps while collecting the treasures. Use Enter or Space to select in the menus. I recommend to play it in full screenmode.<br/></p>\n<p>If you find the map, all the chests and the exit will be pointed with colored arrows.</p>\n<p>Every protection amulet works as an one-shot shield against damage. <br/></p>\n<p>I would love to hear your comments about the game. In a future update maybe I could add mouse and touch support. Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T09:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9ffc746f25a5460f18256f7b9da011.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ArsCreativa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
