The theme of the game jam was \"Duality\". The idea we started with was the duality of past and present, but then we added a flipping mechanic that flipped the gravity as well.</p>\n\n<p>The character controller, level design, and camera were designed by Josh Church.</p>\n<p>The two tracks, Wild West and Suburban were made by Luke Diefenderfer.</p>\n<p>The post processing and jump effect were made by Grayson\u00a0Clark.</p>\n\n<p>If we had more time we would have sent the player back in time (by changing the assets on the ceiling) whenever they flipped gravity in order to combine the two points of our theme.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sprite Sheet: Jack Kinzig</p>\n<p>Miami Photo:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.freeimages.com/photo/miami-city-1218429</p>\n<p>Car Photo:\u00a0https://www.freeimages.com/photo/car-1568850</p>\n<p>Old Hotel Photo:\u00a0https://www.freeimages.com/photo/hotel-1220563</p>\n<p>Font: Bodo Amat (dafont.com)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T05:19:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9be/9bed8b2af68a89a1975f13c9bb3b8b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jmchurch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
