M\u0153urs, usages et costumes, par MM. M. de Cuendias et V. de F\u00e9r\u00e9al. Illustrations par C\u00e9lestin Nanteuil\" and music by HowardWimshurst.</p>\r\n\r\nInstructions.-\r\n<p>Use the mouse to connect dots and spread rumors around. It's all explained in the game.</p>\r\n\r\nMisc.-\r\n\r\n<p>Made in about a day of work. I liked the core mechanic because it's quite simple but easy to expand. The game shows a few of the additional mechanics I had in mind.<br/><br/>Working with public domain art was quite fun. I actually tried drawing the portraits myself, but since I had little time for this jam, I gave up on that pretty soon. To make the other assets in the game I drew them using an ink pen, took pictures of them and edited the photos a bit.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T16:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1fd3d1b5eb99fbc4eceb5d1c601281b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
