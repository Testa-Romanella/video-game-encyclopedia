They make a Filmgame. </p>\n<p>In this case, it is an enhanced text-adventure based game. It is about conspiracy, Aliens, Wikileaks, etc. It is a Game,\u00a0where you can choose your Path. Starting in the End of the Second World War, your Adventure begins with a lie, but was it really a lie? Or is it your destination? Sci-Fi, Thriller and Spy Game Fans will feel at home.</p>\n<p> In this early / Demo version, which we call \"THE PROLOGUE\", it is the Zero Chapter... The Chapter before the Main Game, that were are developing, but still need resources, because it consumes us a lot of Time. Although we enjoy it,\u00a0 the development process is a bit too intense. It is based on accumulation of information, comparing dates, etc. We need support for this long Road\u00a0we really want to walk!</p>\n<p>While you can play this Demo for free, it is preparing you for the next upcoming Chapters. And show you how we work and how our concept of the Game is.<br/>That is why we did not want to sell it, but give it for free. We really enjoyed doing it, although a lot of work was put into, especially because the creativity sometimes did not come along with the possibility of doing it. We were in our beginnings struggling in how we wanted to do the game. <br/>At First, it was only a text based adventure game, than it had sounds... But in the end, we did it in the way how a Filmmaker would do: With a Movie feeling Touch.</p>\n<p>It is an enhanced text based adventure game where you can choose options.</p>\n<p>We know from Experience that some indi games give too many options as answers, making gamers abandon soon the game, and losing the immersible effect of the Story. We do not want that, we keep maximum three options during the gameplay. <br/><br/>All Videos and Images we are using\u00a0in this game is copyfree/copyleft or was created by ourselves. Same goes with the Soundtrack and the Animation which were made by us or were downloaded by copyfree CC Sites. <br/>For more Information, read the Disclaimer in the Game.<br/>Please give us feedback, we really want to know what you think about this Demo,<br/>Hugs,<br/><br/>Tino Trivino (The Filmmaker)<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afa/afa03e217e212bacb9836ccd7b9ca9d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tinotrivino"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
