It is originally played using a cup, two dice, and a coaster that get passed around the table. With this app, you can leave your cup and the dice at home.<br/><br/>COOLEST FEATURES:<br/>* Advanced motion detector recognises the way you shake the phone. Try an up-and-down vs. a left-and-right shake<br/>* Dice animate under the cup<br/>* NEW in v. 1.2: Create your own cup coasters and share screenshots on FB!<br/>* Authentic sound<br/>* Crisp original graphics and animations with up to 401 ppi on iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus<br/>* No cheating by the receiving player is possible without being seen<br/>* Change scenes and coasters<br/>* For two or more players<br/>* No ads or in-app purchases<br/><br/>GAME RULES: <br/>The first player rolls the dice (shakes the phone), then peeks under the cup to see the score of the combined two dice. Only the player knows what's under the cup. The player then claims a score, for example, \u201cforty-one\u201d, before passing the cup carefully over to the next player. Rolls are scored by using the higher die as 10s and the lower die as 1s. For example, a roll of 3 and 5 would be 53. Doubles (e.g. 11, 22, ..., 66) are higher than 65, and a special roll 2-1 is called a twenty-one (or a \u201cMexican\u201d) and is the highest, higher than 66.<br/>The next player has two choices. If he believes the previous player, he cannot look at the result, but instead must roll the dice and MUST claim a higher scoring roll, even if it\u2019s not true, and pass the phone over to the next player. If he doesn\u2019t believe the previous player, he opens the cup, revealing the last roll to everyone. Either the bluffer (=previous player if he/she was caught in a lie) or incorrect challenger (=current player that opened the cup) loses!<br/><br/>More detailed rules and other interesting facts are found in-app.<br/><br/>Graphic design by Tomaz Kosat &amp; Andrej Miksic<br/><br/>Please note:<br/>** Some less common playing variants may NOT be supported. <br/>** In some cultures, the game is played as a drinking game.
