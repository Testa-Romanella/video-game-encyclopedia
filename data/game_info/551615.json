It plays as a puzzle game where you must explore the map looking for a place to dig based on a part of a map you have found. Different tiles have different effects:</p>\n<ul><li>M - Mountains offer a higher vantage points, ending your worker's movement here allows them to survey more tiles</li><li>D - Deserts are treacherous and hard to cross. Crossing deserts with your workers will delay their return for a turn.</li><li>R - Rivers are dangerous and can sweep up your workers. If you cross cross or end on a river tile with your worker, they will die and you don't gain any information about their path.</li><li>F - Forests provide an opportunity to gather valueable resources. Ending a worker's movement on a forest tile allows you to gather lumber.</li><li>B - When crossing a River tile while you have wood, you spend the wood to build a Bridge. Bridge tiles can be crossed without losing your workers.</li><li>C - Chests are found across the map and provide your expedition with powerful items to help finding El Dorado.</li><li>x - When digging in a spot, if you have not found El Dorado it will be marked by an X.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Remember to play on Fullscreen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:35:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af78610665da132533fe2a15a9e8148.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jorim"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
