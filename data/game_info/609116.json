You will find a LOT of inspiration from the original RE series, but I have no plans to implement any 'zombies' or anything of the sort. From the aspect of enemies I am pulling more from the game 'Clock Tower' which genuinely freaked me out as a kid, this concept is much like 'Nemesis' or 'Mr. T', but again I have no plans to have other 'minion' -like enemies and instead want to focus more on puzzles and story.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy the demo and if you are super keen to play the full version I will try to do devlogs on my youtube channel as often as I can, so check that out and sub on my itch.io dev page!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:31:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/543/543819881bdb5c1f3909d91f45451d75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BJ Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
