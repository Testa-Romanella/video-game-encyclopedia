You'll be alright.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Composure is a game about solving puzzles with functions built in point-free style: there are no variables, only combinators.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>You can download native releases for Linux x86_64 and Windows from itch.io (or from CI), or play the Web version here. Native versions are recommended since they run quicker, look prettier, and play audio better. Mobile platforms are unfortunately not supported.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n<p>This game was written in GDLisp targetting Godot 3.5.1.\r\n </p>\n<p>To build you'll need to have Racket installed, and a version of Godot that you can run, along with the export templates (which you can grab from the same site, or download through Godot's GUI).\r\n </p>\n<p>Clone this repository, install the dependencies (make sure you trust me not to blow up your computer, of course):\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n# in the folder with info.rkt\r\nraco pkg install\r\n<p>Compile GDLisp to GDScript:\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nraco gdlisp ./project\r\n<p>Open the project at ./project/project.godot in Godot, and export according to their documentation.\r\n </p>\n<p>You can also look at how CI is set up, if you like reading YAML.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nLicenses\r\n<ul><li>Code is licensed MIT (see LICENSE).\r\n</li><li>Audio is original and licensed here as CC-BY-SA 4.0. <ul><li>It's also available on streaming platforms: Spotify, Apple Music.\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Models are mostly sourced from Quaternius and are public domain here as well, if you want my mildly mangled versions specifically.\r\n</li><li>Fonts all come with their own license information (OFL).\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>I also won't personally run after you with a lawyer if you do manage to violate the copyleft licenses.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T11:50:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/637/6371663e1b50ccc237f01ec9e1a2041a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Eutro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
