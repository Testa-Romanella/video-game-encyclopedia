The\u00a0player can only use 1 character at a\u00a0time but\u00a0can switch to any of the 3 on the fly. The main mechanic is to traverse the level using all 3 scientists\u00a0and adapt to different situations, obstacles and enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Meet the Scientists!</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Isaac Newton</strong>\u00a0\u00a0</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Movement: Moves and jumps normally.\u00a0</li><li>Ability: Shoots apples\u00a0that deal high damage to enemies at a high\u00a0fire rate; apples have no gravity and fly in a straight line.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ol><li><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong>\u00a0</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Movement: Moves faster and jumps normally.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Ability: Quickly dash in the direction you are facing; can be done while in\u00a0midair.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ol><li><strong>William Osler</strong>\u00a0</li></ol>\n<ul><li>Movement: Moves slower and jumps normally.\u00a0</li><li>Ability: Throws a stethoscope that deals low damage to enemies and heals for a percentage of the damage dealt; the stethoscope has a low fire rate and are affected by gravity.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>Interpretation of the\u00a0</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>heme \u201cFigures\u201d:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different\u00a0definitions\u00a0for\u00a0the word \u201cfigure\u201d exist;\u00a0one of them\u00a0reads:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201c<strong>A</strong><strong>\u00a0person that played a significant role in a situation or event.</strong>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0History is full of important people who have accomplished great things.\u00a0For the game idea, the development team focused on making a\u00a0fun 2D\u00a0Platformer\u00a0using\u00a0famous figures of history\u00a0as the main characters.\u00a0All 3 of the\u00a0playable\u00a0scientists\u00a0are people who have accomplished great things for humanity, and their inclusion in the game could even be considered a little homage to their accomplishments.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Isaac Newton</strong>\u00a0best known for his theory in the laws of gravity. In the game the apple represents the incident in his life that sparked his curiosity about gravity when an apple fell\u00a0off a tree and hit him in the head; as a fun twist his apples do not follow the laws of his own theory.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong>\u00a0best known for his projects and experiments on\u00a0electricity. In the game, despite having a few pounds on him, he moves faster and can dash at the speed of lighting, sort of.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>William Osler</strong>\u00a0best known as The Father of\u00a0Modern Medicine and the greatest diagnostician to ever wield a stethoscope. In the game\u00a0his slow movement speed represents his calculated precision as\u00a0a doctor. The stethoscope\u00a0although a\u00a0considerably\u00a0harmless instrument, can heal the player whenever it deals damage to an enemy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hence the name of the game\u00a0<strong>History Heroes</strong>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Tools used to make \u201cHistory Heroes\u201d:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Unity 2019\u00a0</li><li>Visual Studio 2019\u00a0</li><li>Pixel Studio\u00a0</li><li>Pixilart\u00a0</li><li>Free Unity Assest from the Unity Asset Store\u00a0<ul><li>Sunny Land\u00a0</li><li>Grotto\u00a0Escape 1 &amp; 2\u00a0</li><li>Casual Game Sounds\u00a0</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Team Members:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Petter\u00a0Vazquez \u2013 Game developer, game programmer\u00a0</li><li>Gabriel\u00a0 Torres \u2013 Pixel artist,\u00a0project manager\u00a0</li><li>Aishla\u00a0\u00a0Negr\u00f3n\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Pixel artist, project documenter\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef8a86b9c5670dc726f3a3b8c17272b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["itsmepita"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
