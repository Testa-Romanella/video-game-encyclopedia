Through the art direction of our game it was essential to convey a whole range of emotions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We wanted to forged a world with a lot of personality and storytelling.Starting in a wide dreamy colorful village you will be transported to dark and gloomy forests to the top of a dragon peak surrounded by the deep water of the ocean. Contrasted with this very colorful world you will venture out in a world full of dark secret that will make you shiver !<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Combat</strong><br/>Similar to other action adventure RPGs such as Dark Soul and The Witcher, W\u00e9ko The Mask Gatherer has a very elaborate range of combat mechanics. W\u00e9ko The Mask Gatherer features a range of elaborate combat mechanics. Here is an introduction to the basics of the combat system: W\u00e9ko has a two-sided weapon. One side is a long blade that can slice through enemies, the other side is more massive and curved to stun and crush them. The combat system is divided into 3 stances. Each of the stances has a different power and speed, giving the player the possibility to create different attacks combined. Linked to a stamina bar the player will have to learn to juggle between running, rolling and attacks.<br/><br/><strong>Stamina</strong><br/>Stamina is the energy you use to perform various actions such as attacking, blocking, parrying, rolling or sprinting. Stamina is therefore an extremely important element in combat for W\u00e9ko. Stamina is regenerated when you stop moving. This makes evasion and regeneration a very important part of the combat system.<br/>Therefore when you are low on stamina, won\u2019t be able to attack or roll away for enemies. Always Keep your eye on the stamina bar.<br/><br/><strong>W\u00e9ko\u2019s Masks</strong><br/><br/>Throughout the adventure, W\u00e9ko will be able to collect and store each mask in his wooden backpack. Working as an energy catalyst, this box contains the energy of the masks. Once placed on the outside of the box, W\u00e9ko can use their magic to temporarily acquire their power. A lot of mechanics in the game will be activated by the discovery of the masks during the adventure to give an example; some will give the power to glide, others to run faster or to block powerful attacks.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Shield Masks<br/>Each side of the bag is specific to a type of mask. As shown below; on the back of the box you can find the shield mask, mainly for defense with some advantages such as a retaliation mechanic the shield can also in some cases be thrown to hit targets at distance.<br/>Active Masks<br/>On the left side are placed the active masks. It is possible to place only one active mask at a time giving various powers to W\u00e9ko directly impacting the gameplay ( active bonus ), such as the Glider Mask which allows him to glide.<br/>Relic Masks<br/>Finally on the right side we find the relic masks. It will be possible to activate up to 3 at the same time. These give W\u00e9ko more discreet advantages (passive bonus); such as a faster stamina rise or a life regeneration increased according to the number of enemies killed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lock-on in combat<br/>While fighting you will be able to lock on enemies. Locking allows you to hit your target more easily. Clicking on a specific key you will lock onto the nearest enemy if they are within range. If there are multiple enemies, you can switch targets by moving the mouse to the left or right once you're locked on. Locking also locks your movements to your target and makes it harder to be aware of your surroundings during combat, so be careful when you lock on. You will have to learn how and when to switch from lock to lockout.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:09:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4a/d4a3f95087135763bfb687e4bcb3351c.jpg", "website": "https://www.wekoproject.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 373, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simon Da Silva", "Robin Haefeli"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Simon Da Silva Studio", "Robin Haefeli Atelier"], "esrb_rating": null}
