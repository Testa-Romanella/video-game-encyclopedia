{"id": 120928, "slug": "in-consequence", "name": "In Consequence", "name_original": "In Consequence", "description": "<p>Fours compete for gamepad space and game board superiority in this fast paced, NES inspired game.  Each player used a quadrant of the game-pad (player 1 uses the left analog, player to the D-Pad, etc) to move their character up, down, left, or right, and wear away the game board tiles, leaving holes behind for their opponents to avoid. </p><p>**  EDIT **</p><p>The controls have been updated to accept keyboard commands now.  Player 1 uses WASD, player 2 uses IJKL, player 3 the arrow keys, and player 4 uses the Numpad (numlock must be off).  </p><p>** END EDIT **<br/></p><p> Fall in a hole, loose the board and a life, be the last player standing and you get 3 points.  There are bonuses hidden in the tiles that can increase or decrease your score, and enemies who will try to affect your ability to move on the board and complete your carefully laid plan.  </p><p>This is an early version, and requires a gamepad to play.  I plan to make a version with a variety of inputs, a single player game mode, and many other improvements, that will hopefully be up be the end of the week.  </p><p>Give it a shot with some friends; the action is frantic and fun.</p><p>Big thanks to David Vitas (davidvitas.com) for supplying the music and sound effects.  <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48a/48ad98703f89233308f39c66f7c99b7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bstuart"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
