You accept your new job, filled with determination to follow in her footsteps. You open her recipe book but find that it is full of tears and holes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your goal now is to complete customer orders with only a few ingredients listed in the cookbook. But, you've got this. After all, you've always been great in the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p>Known Problems and Information:</p>\n<p>1) The Leaderboard is disabled, it worked in Unity but would crash or freeze the game when exported, and we didn't have enough time to figure out the cause, so reluctantly we disabled it.</p>\n<p>2) There are a good few bugs with customers if you try to fill too many orders before more customers arrive, this can essentially softlock the game. It's not feasible to get this if you play the game normally.</p>\n<p>3) The thumbnail is from what our concept was, several problems in the last few days caused a reduction in original scope of the project.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move.</p>\n<p>Left click of Left Control to interact (Pickup/Drop Ingredients, use register and open book)</p>\n<p>Designer:\u00a0https://blakekitten.itch.io/<br/>Programmers:\u00a0https://dreadkyller.itch.io/\u00a0,\u00a0https://nekonoone.itch.io/<br/>Artist:\u00a0https://sofa-bed-studios.itch.io/<br/>Musician:\u00a0https://pavelkovbasyuk.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54e/54e8084901e70a816fa3ab69ad281618.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DreadKyller", "ClawtheWolf", "Sofa Bed Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
