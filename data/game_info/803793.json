DESTROY.</strong></em></p>\n<p>You thought you knew your job well before this assignment. You thought you had things under control. When the folder found your hands, you went where the dog whistle pointed you -- Warden, a sleepy town in the Appalachians. A few missing townies, a few urban legends. They're nothing to you, your agency's best hunting hound.</p>\n<p>But when your arrival coincides with the awakening of an ancient evil, you realize you've bitten off more than you can chew. You'll need allies, and you'll need your wits. But what will you do if you lose both?</p>\n<p><em>Greenwarden: Book One\u00a0</em>is a word-based interactive horror game set in the Appalachian wilderness. Play as the Tracker, one of the best of the best, and make friends (or enemies), uncover the truth behind the disappearances of Warden, West Virginia, and try not to lose your mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Rated 16+ for crude language, violence, and horror.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:23:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f237e083ec3710723ac80d3b7e9d0aa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fiddles IFs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
