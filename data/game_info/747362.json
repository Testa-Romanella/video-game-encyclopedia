I have been programming since I'm 11 and I have been learning game development on my own\u00a0for 3 years now. I'm proud to present my first game:\u00a0\u00a0Meteor strike.\u00a0Meteor Strike is a simple 2D game, your objective is to dodge various falling hazards and survive as long as possible. This project was part of a challenge I made for a youtube video where I had to make a game in only 6 days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is pretty basic, buggy, and pretty much horrible, but this is the first step in my journey into becoming a fully-fledged game developer. Any tips/advice, criticism, or support is really appreciated and means a lot to me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I Highly suggest people skip the donation part, but if you appreciate my work and want to support me by donating, it honestly means the world to me. This money will be invested in upgrading my equipment and buying various courses in order to improve my game development skills.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:19:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc861942b203d825d9bf8d881c417964.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["everyyy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
