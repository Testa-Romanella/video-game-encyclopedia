Imagine flying in that space, going higher and lower, left and right and fly wherever you want to fly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHelium Skies 2 is a casual indie game where the player controls a small airplane with a goal to collect all the helium molecules in every level. The airplane can go in basic directions, but the part that is most fun is doing trick in the sky - loops, barrel rows and whatever you can think of! There is a catch in this one though - your plane is going out of fuel and it uses helium for fuel, so you mustn't let it fall down from the skies. Collect all the molecules to pass all levels and finish the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3de/3deb2b7c9a4b4924e0393543652e7ee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Netfork Studios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
