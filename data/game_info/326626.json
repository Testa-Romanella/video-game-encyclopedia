You need to distract it by typing as many coherent English words as possible as fast as possible for as long as you have to. </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>There's a meter that shows you how close the super computer is to taking over the world. This meter fills in real time. After you type a word, the game checks a dictionary to see if the word is real (like spellcheck). While it's checking the Death Meter stops. If it's a real word, it looses a small amount of its Death Meter. If it's not a word, it gains some of its Death Meter. All words have to be four letters or more. Hitting the space bar signifies that a work is complete. <br/>You can't use the same word twice, and longer words are more \"distracting\" (detract more from the Death Meter).\" -</em>\u00a0This Machine Kills Fascis</p><p>A game made from the ideas of\u00a0Select Button\u00a0forum\u00a0member,\u00a0This Machine Kills Fascis.</p><p>Requires Python 3.
