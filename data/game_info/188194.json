As you mine gold your dwarves get stronger. Conquer all the mines to win the game. </p>\n\n\n<p>The jam lasted 72 hours but I only had time to spend about 10 hours on the game. For that reason the unit sprites and animations were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, and there's no sound in the game. Still, I\u00a0think it's quite fun to play and that there's potential here for a great game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/222/2220198b3d287e6143c17ed24d8f62ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LuckyFeathers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
