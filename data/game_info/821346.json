To do this you crawl through ventilation on an extreme journey back to your deck of cards. The theme of this jam is ROLL OF THE DICE so how I\u00a0decided to go about this is you roll a dice with E and whatever you roll is how many times you can jump. If you get a higher roll the levels become easier. With easy courses making sure you have 4+ jumps on the other hand if you roll low you are forced to take the harder path. Hope you enjoy this game by a young indie developer.\u00a0\u00a0Please enjoy this game I worked hard on it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/182/182b7b8d5c1e1234faff2c7de4476fde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["E9studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
