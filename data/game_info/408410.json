{"id": 408410, "slug": "dodge-stuff", "name": "Dodge Stuff", "name_original": "Dodge Stuff", "description": "<p><strong>Dodge Stuff</strong> is a fast-paced, minimalist, abstract action game.\u00a0The game is focused around movement, with each type of enemy having a different attack pattern that forces you to avoid them in unique ways. You try to avoid being hit while moving around the map to interact with various items.</p>\n<p>Matches last about 3 minutes each. You go up against a wave of enemies that you must survive for 10 seconds to defeat them. Each time you beat them, a new enemy spawns, making the game harder. Between rounds you can purchase items that will help you avoid the enemies.\u00a0After two and a half minutes, you'll fight the boss wave, in which enemies cannot be killed, and you survive for as long as more and more enemies spawn.</p><p>This was a very small-scale project that I worked for only a few weeks. I\u00a0didn't put much effort into the presentation or themeing of the game because this was mainly an exploration of some mechanics I wanted to try out and I didn't think that better graphics would add much to the experience. For the same reason, the game has no sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T02:20:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ad/1adcd41e2257944eb45aecb8b0bbf10f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ella Hoeppner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
