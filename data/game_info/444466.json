You would just do a suicide mission however it looks like the reward of your journey is immortality. &gt;</p>\n<p>I wanted to challenge myself to make a C game in raylib for the first time however that didn't work out. I ended up going from Raylib C to Raylib C# to Unity in order to finish the game. I had a fun time though challenging myself. I'll eventually release a video here of the development process. Anyway here's how I approached the theme.</p>\n<p>- Player Respawn</p>\n<p>- Can't kill the boss \"Death is not the End Boss\"</p>\n<p>I probably could interpret the theme better but I was trying to challenge myself in coding in C more than actually trying to make a feasible game. Ha. Regardless hope you enjoy it, and if you don't enjoy the game then I hope you enjoy the video of my development process when it comes out. Cheers to a fun jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T02:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9cf692d7a95e18941893d4da0c7dc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SkyanSam"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
