Connect the starting colors to various shapes that manipulate colors in their unique way. The goal is to create the target color.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach of the 9 shapes manipulates colors differently. It's up to you to find out how and use them to achieve the solution.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPut your combination skills through a test of 84 levels, none two of which are solved the same way, while your combinations create a colorful nebula in the background. In order to not disturb you from the experience, the game contains absolutely no text.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBecause color channels are also represented by shapes, Color Assembler is fully accessible to colorblind people.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4ab9c07387306cbd27792133c2e6cd.jpg", "website": "http://www.purplenebulagames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 22}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purple Nebula"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Purple Nebula"], "esrb_rating": null}
