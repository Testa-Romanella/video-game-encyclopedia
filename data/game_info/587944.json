Sounds easy? And easy it is. If not for the fact that you have a serious coffee addiction, your work habits are absolutely awful, and worst of all - the temperature in your room never seems to be just right. It's always either too hot or too cold. Also, that weird buzz just outside your window all the time, what's up with that?<br/></p>\n<p> Can you manage to finish the game, or are your distractions just too much to manage?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Just use your mouse to click on things. Keyboard is used to complete minigames.</p>\n<p><strong>Source code<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game is open source.
