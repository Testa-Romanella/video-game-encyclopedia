Whoops ! <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out Ultra Modulable Tank Party, my entry for the Extra Game Jam #4 !</p>\n<p>Play through 9 levels including 3 tutorial levels and 2 boss fights, connecting batteries to specific modules allowing your tank to adapt and upgrade its abilities.\u00a0</p>\r\nCommands:\r\n<p>While in action : <br/></p>\n<ul><li>A/D : Move left/right \u00a0 (for QWERTY users, Q/D will work as well)</li><li>Space : Jump. Hold while in air to hover if that ability is unlocked (to unlock it, power your jump module up to lv.2)</li><li>Mouse : Aim.</li><li>Left Click : Shoot if your gun is activated (to activate it, power your gun frequency module up to lv.1)</li></ul>\n<p>While in pause (\"Management Menu\"):</p>\n<ul><li>Click &amp; Hold on battery : select battery.</li><li>Drag to a module while a battery is selected : connect the battery to that module.</li><li>Click on connected battery : erase the connection from the battery.</li></ul>\n<p>Don't worry, it sounds hard with all those module things, but it should make more sense by playing the tutorial. Experimenting is the best way to understand :)</p>\n<p>Also, you should note that hovering over a module in the Management Menu highlights its name in the list next to \u00a0it. Very useful if you forget which module does what !</p>\r\nCredits : \r\n<p>I used Eeve Somepx's AWESOME font \"Softball\" (see @somepx / info@somepx.com)...</p>\n<p>and Joshua McLean's AMAZING music tracks<br/></p>\n<p>(Contains music \u00a92019 Joshua McLean (mrjoshuamclean.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International)</p>\n<p>All of those are under a Creative Commons license.
