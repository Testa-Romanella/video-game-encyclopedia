Enjoy :)</p>\n<p>Sound effects are made by myself. Music generally is as well.<br/>Exceptions:<br/>- Vital music (Gravity Sound)<br/></p>\n<p>Note: At the time of uploading this page it seems that Itch's image server is down or something. I'll fix screenshots and stuff when I can.</p>\r\nCaveeyat\r\n<p>A platformer game about building your own house from items bought from a merchant. Money is earned by scavenging. Did not get that far, obviously.<br/>Controls:<br/>-\u00a0A and D to move, space to jump. Can double jump.<br/>- Q to open/close inventory while scavenging. You can open it at your home, but that's not intentional.<br/>- Click to shoot.<br/>- Mousewheel fast to reload.<br/>- E to interact. Interactables have a thingy above their head while you are standing near them.<br/>- Click to build if interacted with building table.<br/>- Can't be bothered to look up the building table controls but there's a few stuff like mirror, change color, etc.</p>\r\nProject: Plot\r\n<p>Prototype of building for a game about building stuff. That's pretty much it.<br/>Controls:<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Click to place block.<br/>- Right click to erase block.<br/>- Move mouse to move his very tiny face and floppy arms. Very good boy.</p>\r\nVital (Dungeon)\r\n<p>Having the story for Vital in mind, I could never decide what I wanted to do with the game. I was always too ambitious. This is one of the versions I tried. Includes a basic, seeded dungeon and a bare-bones survival mode.<br/>Controls:<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Click to shoot.<br/>- Hold shift to run.<br/>- E to interact.</p>\r\nVital\r\n<p>Intended to be my final iteration of Vital. My goal was to create a sort of roguelite Warioware-type game. I'm still pretty happy with it. This is currently being remade into a much different game.<br/>Controls: (1) Top-down shooter<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Click to shoot.<br/>- Right-click to shoot offhand.<br/>- Space to swap weapons.<br/>- E to interact (hover over item).<br/>Controls: (2) ASCII<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Hold click to ready sword. Swing to mark enemies. Let go to hit marked enemies.<br/>Controls: (3) 3D something<br/>- WASD to move.<br/>- Mouse to look around.<br/>- Left click to shoot.<br/>- Space to jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d9/5d97545e420cea3ad28e6c7ca75b9c3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Knilax"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
