{"id": 609237, "slug": "momentanium-prototype", "name": "Momentanium Prototype", "name_original": "Momentanium Prototype", "description": "<p>---------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><em>Momentanium </em>is a platformer fighting game inspired by games such as <em>Brawlhalla </em>and the <em>Super Smash Bros</em> series. Where <em>Momentanium </em>differs from similar games is the heavy focus on momentum and keeping up your attacks, as the platforming has been programmed to maintain your momentum, and attacks deal more damage the faster you are moving.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furthermore, each attack deals extra damage called <em>combo damage </em>(indicated by the yellow section of the health bars). Any <em>combo damage</em> done to a player is regenerated back over time, meaning players are encouraged to play more aggressively to take full advantage of <em>combo damage</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>This prototype was created for a final year project to look into and experiment with the mechanics commonly found in platform fighters, as well as test out new potential mechanics that could be implemented into future games of this genre. I hope you enjoy it!\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>You can read the document explaining the game, as well as find the link for the survey on the project, here:\u00a0https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qX3oOeMh5HOJKWEa7GQfUHCREbuWYxiUAT_20OPD-A/...</p>\n<p>---------------------------------</p>\n<p>Cover art is from a track that was made for the prototype but not used.
