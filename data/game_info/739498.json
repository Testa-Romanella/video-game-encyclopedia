It is the fourth in a series of &quot;gaiden&quot; Wizardry games developed by Japanese studio Access and influenced heavily by Sir-Tech&#39;s core Wizardry series. The game was fan translated in late 2016.</p>\n<p>Throb of the Demon&#39;s Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion.</p>\n<p>It is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T18:09:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6a/e6ac251271fc765a546f6ed11e833985.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["ASCII"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
