Additionaly, you can try to make it as fast as it's possible. <br/>My personal record is 145,30 seconds. Can you beat it?</p>\n<p>Simply you control cube movement using WASD/Arrow keys or gamepad left analog stick.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing in advance!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I've learned by making this game</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, playtesting game is very important. More you playtest, the more things you will notice, which you won't see during the \"production\" stage.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, Make sure, that game is fair and it doesn't just force you to guess(e.g where to go, what covers behind the corner or to clearly see, how many space do you have)</p>\n<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, If you add a feature or modify existing one to make it more performant or just clear code, make sure that It won't break anything.</p>\n<p><strong>Fourthly,</strong> Make sure, that checkpoints are placed in the right spot and there are no situations, where you spawn and you die again, because checkpoint is not safe...(It's not only about checkpoints, also about safe zones for example)</p>\n<p><strong>Fifthly</strong>, This one might be not so useful for game dev specifically(I mean, it depends on game, if you want it to be targeted to speedruners it's good to realise), but speedruning requires a lot of patience and having nerves\u00a0 of steel. That's one of the reasons why making game as fair as possible is important and reduce the RNG as much as it is\u00a0 possible if game is considered being targeted to speedruners. How did i find this\u00a0 out? Well... guess :)</p>\n<p><strong>Sixtly</strong>, If not doing game, where very precise movement is required, try to increase the zone of error and play in favor of player, so\u00a0 there won't be\u00a0 so many\u00a0\u00a0situations, where he won't know, what happened, why he died and so on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T04:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e39127c2c066a751c10a5187c1c0d7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Don Kyniu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
