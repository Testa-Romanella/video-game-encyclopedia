The camera angle will always be fixed to a First-Person perspective so that player immersion remains constant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The visual style and aesthetic of the game is built to reflect a dark, grimy, otherworldly atmosphere that keeps the player in a place of consistent fear and tension. This will be exhibited through a dark color palette consisting of blacks, dark browns, dark blues and dark greens, as well as environmental elements such as a deep, dark ocean and never-ending fog surrounding the player and an old, stranded pirate ship serving as the primary play arena. The enemies as well, will be displayed as other-worldly, contorted and repulsive monsters whose design reflects other monsters of old literature like Cthulhu or Davy Jones.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This was made by a team of eight in four months, please feel free to have a go and enjoy yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:52:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ce/6ce2c18ff275611b34ad98c3de2e1f18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaydenCottle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
