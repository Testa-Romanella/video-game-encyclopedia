At the moment Triolith Entertainment has a shortage of funds and we need to start generate more revenue and ad\u2019s is at the moment our best option. Due to this I had the option to either make Wisp free and ad ads or start to thinking about closing down the business and remove the games (but I prefer to keep the games alive). So this is the reason, and to any old customers that doesn&amp;#39;t like the ads I am sorry but it was a necessary evil, I\u2019ll see what we can do to limit ads you see.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d5bc68eff8711f0c9e347f3b202e8ba.jpeg", "website": "http://www.triolith.com/games/wisp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Triolith Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Triolith Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
