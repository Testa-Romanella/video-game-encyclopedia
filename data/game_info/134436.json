Hoping to add new levels soon. This is my favorite remake</p>\n<p>Also included a few extra goonies games in the package.</p>\n<p>This game was made by Konami in 1986. There were both a NES version and an MSX version of the game; this remake is based on the MSX version.</p>\n<p>This remake was made for the 2006 competition organized by Retro Remakes. After having participated in 2003 (with Road Fighter, which finished on the 7th place out of 83 entries), and in 2004 (with F-1 Spirit, gaining the 13th place amongst the 73 contestants), we decided to give another go at the first prize! Even though we didn't make it to the first place, we are still happy with a 5th place (out of 76)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002bf0e163b40f05a6dd5c78b4f9bcd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Retroreloader @ Return learn games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
