There are different types of bunnies, platforms, portals, elevators, buttons, doors and etc. After the first episode it will be a real challenge for your brain!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>\n<p>Ok... Anyone curious about the Bunnyrama story? Strange\u2026 but who we are to judge you? So please, make yourselves comfortable, and I will\u00a0 begin...</p>\n<p>A long time ago and far far away (well... maybe not so long and not so far, but humor me, it sounds much more dramatic this way). In his small wooden house, lived an old man. His name is not important because even he didn't remember it.</p>\n<p>His house was deep in the forest, and he loved nature and animals. Sadly when he tried to sing to them, those ungrateful creatures scattered in all directions and attempted to gnaw off their own ears (he was not a beautiful princess with the voice of a songbird). But the old man was a very amiable person, so he didn\u2019t care and tried to help every little creature in the forest. Especially he loved hares and rabbits, because they are so cute (aren\u2019t they?..).</p>\n\n<p>One very rainy day, a flood came to the forest. All the poor little creatures were trapped on a small island.\u00a0 Even though he was drunk, (well what would you do if you\u2019d lived alone in the forest?) our old man jumped onto his raft...</p>\n<p>No one knows what happened next. Did he really see the white rabbit? or it was a result of his new recipe?\u2026 But here the true story begins\u2026</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/085/0850c9fd63343c317526db6bd0a531f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starwindgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
