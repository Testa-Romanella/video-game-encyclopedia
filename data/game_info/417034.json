{"id": 417034, "slug": "operation-felix", "name": "Operation Felix", "name_original": "Operation Felix", "description": "<p>This is a simulation of a hypothetical German assault on Gibraltar, as outlined in the proposed Operation Felix.\u00a0 The game assumes that Spain decides to allow German forces to move through its territory in early 1941, making Spain a combatant in the Second World War.\u00a0 You play the British, and you must stop the Germans from capturing Gibraltar and closing the Western Mediterranean to Allied forces.\u00a0 Your best bet is to cooperate with the Republican forces that are still waging a guerrilla war against Franco's regime.\u00a0 The Spanish Civil War ended less than two years ago, and there are lots of Spaniards inside and outside of Spain willing to fight for the allies.\u00a0 There are also lots of Spanish generals who are perfectly happy to take a bribe from MI6 and keep their troops in their barracks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are two key assumptions in this game.\u00a0 The first is that the Spanish and the Germans could effectively cut off Gibraltar from resupply by sea, and eventually starve the British out.\u00a0 In 1941, this would probably have been possible.\u00a0 The Germans could have mined the waters around Gibraltar with submarines and nighttime bombing runs.\u00a0 Artillery batteries on the Spanish mainland could have destroyed any British minesweepers that tried to clear the mine fields.\u00a0 The British airstrip between the rock and the mainland would also be out of commission, cutting the Gibraltar garrison off from aerial resupply.\u00a0 The Germans and the Spanish would simply need to wait.\u00a0   </p>\n<p>The second assumption is that there were lots of people inside and outside of Spain who willing to take up arms against Spain\u2019s Fascist government.\u00a0 With British support, the Spanish Republican government in exile could probably scrape together a few hundred thousand troops inside and outside the country.\u00a0 In fact, anti-fascist guerrillas continued to fight the Spanish government long after the official end to the Spanish Civil War in 1939.\u00a0 A few Sten guns and some air support would turn these Republican veterans into a formidable fighting force.\u00a0 At the same time, there would be lots of Fascist officers with little stomach for a fight.\u00a0 If Spain did enter the War on the side of the Axis, the British would be sure to blockade Spanish ports, cutting Spain of from oil and other critical imports.\u00a0 This is why the (x) Spanish divisions in the game cannot move.\u00a0 The British would also almost certainly occupy Spanish Morocco and the Canary Islands.\u00a0 With no money to feed, arm or pay one\u2019s troops, a Spanish general might be willing to take a bribe from the British to stay out of the fight.\u00a0 As it happens, many Spanish generals did take bribes from MI6.\u00a0 This is why you have cards that make Spanish army units disappear.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0You have all the tools you need in your card deck to restart the Spanish Civil War.\u00a0 Your challenge is sparking a big enough rebellion to lift the siege of Gibraltar before it is too late.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:42:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f186b11ba2f541a67e9e5d9e04d28a83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
