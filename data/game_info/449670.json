Try it here!</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n  Based on the iconic Rubik's Cube, and inspired by tile-matching games, Rubix\r\n  is an engaging puzzle game for mobile that strives for an easygoing, yet\r\n  immersive gameplay that will keep you <strong>HOOKED!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The goal of the game:</strong> match each cube with its platform.\r\n  Sounds easy, right? Here's the catch: you can only switch the color of 3\r\n  neighboring cubes at a time. Might sound like a trivial problem, but you'd be\r\n  amazed!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  Over 1,000 levels vary from 2 to 4 colors for the cubes to cycle through,\r\n  increasing their difficulty further! Rubix also includes 5 different special\r\n  cubes that introduce challenging new gameplay mechanics. Don\u2019t forget to\r\n  complete 60+ achievements (with hilarious pop culture references!).\r\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul>\n<li>An engaging gameplay</li>\n<li>Over 1,000 mind-bending levels</li>\n<li>5 special cubes, with challenging mechanics</li>\n<li>Complete 60+ achievements</li>\n<li>In-game level editor</li>\n<li>Test and vote levels created by others</li>\n<li>Localized in English, Spanish &amp; German (more coming soon!)</li>\n<li>Rubix is a premium game with no ads or in-app purchases</li>\n</ul>\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n<p>\r\n  In the summer of 2017, Rubix started out as a totally different project.\r\n  Initially formed by a group of game dev newbies from Mexico City, our\r\n  aspirations were big and broad: we wanted to create the next big thing for the\r\n  mobile gaming community. But by the time universities resumed, our ambitions\r\n  faced reality: we had set sail on a big endeavor and we couldn't do this by\r\n  ourselves. Luckily around this time, a German company named BusyBytes took\r\n  interest in our project and decided to support us with its development.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  Once we got some people to play our initial versions, we faced a bigger\r\n  problem: our original gameplay mechanic was too hard to play and our testers\r\n  didn't understand it. One by one quit, and from the original group of\r\n  developers, only one remained: the visual artist,\r\n  <strong>Santiago Degetau.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  He took over the task, learned to code, and after many mistakes, proofs of\r\n  concept, design iterations, and tons of help from <strong>BusyBytes</strong>,\r\n  the game was completed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n  From a summer amateur project, Rubix turned into a world-class mobile\r\n  experience for iOS and Android. On May, 2020, Rubix was released on the\r\n  <strong>App Store &amp; Play Store.</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658430ddef024e9176bf25d0748a63e9.jpg", "website": "https://rubixgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "iOS"], "developers": ["BusyBytes"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["BusyBytes"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
