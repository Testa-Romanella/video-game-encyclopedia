You play two prisoners who are chained together to escape their prison, while the police is looking for you. The problem is, both of you are hurt, therefor one called Jeff can Jump but not walk and for the other one Carlit is the opposite. Therefor the game is more fun played in a duo, but also very doable in a solo team.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun :)</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>-a/ left arrow : Walk left</p>\n<p>-d/ right arrow : Walk right</p>\n<p>-space : Jump</p>\n<p>-tab : Menu</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to my awesome brother for creating the great music and to VEXED for creating this awesome environment pack( https://v3x3d.itch.io/retro-lines )</p>\n<p>Hope you have fun :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:09:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54f4b808c7e1c45326349ac7b93a6c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lpf-Game"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
