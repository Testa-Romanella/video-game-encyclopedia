{"id": 403274, "slug": "brightly-wrapped-boxes", "name": "Brightly-Wrapped Boxes", "name_original": "Brightly-Wrapped Boxes", "description": "<p>It\u2019s your friend\u2019s birthday, and you\u2019ve planned a massive surprise party. Everyone\u2019s invited! But maybe you invited a few too many, as they all start showing up with gifts. No big deal, right? It\u2019s just some gifts. Now, where to put them?</p>\n<p>That looks like a good place.</p>\n<p>Brightly-Wrapped Boxes is a small game about fitting a never-ending supply of gifts onto the table without letting any fall to the floor or making people wait too long for you to take their gifts. Arrange the gifts carefully around the table. It\u2019s ok if you stack them, but be careful they don\u2019t fall!</p>\n<p>Stacked!</p>\n<p>==============================================</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the mouse to pick up, move, and place gifts on the table. It will show red when there\u2019s something in the way, but sometimes you can fit it in anyway. You can use the spacebar to pick up and place gifts as well.</p>\n<p>Use A and D or the left and right arrow keys to move around the table. You can look up and down a little with W and S or the up and down arrow keys.</p>\n<p>The escape key will bring up an options menu (with just volume control and a chance to exit the game). Time doesn\u2019t pass in the options menu.</p>\n<p>All of the controls can be remapped in the launcher (except for the web version).</p>\n<p>==============================================</p>\n<p>Brightly-Wrapped Boxes was my submission to Ludum Dare 42 (Running Out of Space). Check out its jam page here.\u00a0This game was made in Unity3D 2018.1.0f2. I used Paint.Net and Krita for the 2D work, and the 3D was entirely done in Unity. For Audio, I used LMMS with some VST instruments from DSK Music and Audacity for the sound effects. The font I used in this game is called Peace Sans. It\u2019s by Sergey Ryadovoy and Jovanny Lemonad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/80297ae24e29a08f16ab6ad967e258fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["incobalt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
