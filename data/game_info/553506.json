{"id": 553506, "slug": "detective-prototype", "name": "Detective Prototype", "name_original": "Detective Prototype", "description": "<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>\n<p>Play as lead detective on all kinds of criminal cases such as murder, kidnapping, assault, stalking, and more to track down and prosecute the assailant\u2026 but it\u2019s not quite that simple. Can there be a justification for every crime? Challenge your views on what justice means at the end of every case when you must decide between making the morally right choice, or following the law.</p>\n<p>Unlike other detective games, there are no multiple choice prompts, full freedom to solve the cases in any order you want, and the chance to totally screw things up and arrest the wrong person. Your choices at the end of each case will also have consequences. If you let someone off the hook, will they offend again? If you prosecute someone, will they take revenge on you?\u00a0</p>\n<p>FEATURES:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Type your own questions in interrogations.</li><li>Arrange your thoughts/clues and prosecute suspects using a corkboard with string.</li><li>Choose between the moral or lawful option in every case.</li><li>Your choices have consequences.</li></ul>\n<p>DISCLAIMER:</p>\n<p>***Please note this is a demo in very early development and bugs may occur as we are still working on it.
