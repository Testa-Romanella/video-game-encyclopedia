A hated thing you can't see, can't understand; something that has twisted the world's worlds into something strange and different. How can you put those feelings into words? Maybe you can't, really. Maybe we struggle with lexical expression for this scenario, our expression system in the dark for dealing with literal earth-altering events. Even our bodies, evolved for fight or flight, struggle, here, to do either. Well, not now. Using the height of embodied technology, now you can outlet your feelings. Now you can beat the shit out of the coronavirus.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc360449f55e1e365cc2a8effc2dfe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jacktionman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
