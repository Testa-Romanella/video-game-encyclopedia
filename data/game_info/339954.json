Race to the finish line on tracks that twist and turn through the air. However, you will have to avoid the other 29 cars on the track or else face the consequences! If you&#39;re in a competitive mood, try to win a Grand Prix Cup, get the fastest lap time in a Time Trial, or destroy the competition in a Death Race. You can also challenge three friends in the Versus mode. With five separate play modes, hidden vehicles and courses, and an excellent sound track, F-Zero X still represents one of the best racing titles to date!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T13:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5bb/5bba9378ab04a5ebf457888047bf19bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
