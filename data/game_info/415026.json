The dice rolls are completely random and how you increase or decrease your energy pts will therefore be random.</p>\n<p>This is to represent what a young carer's life is like... sometimes it can be random.</p>\n<p>When you land on a tile, you are either increasing or decreasing your energy points. Energy points represent the energy that a young carer has, to do the things they do on a daily basis. The cards are randomised from a list, and when you draw a card, they represent a situation that a young carer goes through.</p>\n<p>Instructions are provided as to how you can play the game.</p>\n<p>Have fun, and I hope you enjoy the game.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is in active development.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:57:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/056/0563fa85456cc874dd02f9e15f6ac294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reko Smith"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
