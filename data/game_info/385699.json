The more charged neurons, the healthier our brain. The healthier the brain, the more fully-fledged life a person lives.<br/><br/>It would seem that the task is very simple, but no. To choose the direction of movement, the power of thought should be at rest, and for this you need to correctly use the obstacles that are on the levels.  Avoid dangerous red thoughts, they are destructive. Unlock doors to new spaces by contacting special yellow neuron. Destroy destructive red thoughts with positive green thoughts. Teleport from one space to another using purple neurotransmitters. Think, make a decision and look for the right path to neurons, and charge them all with energy.<br/><br/><br/>Main Features:<br/><br/>- 80 logical tasks;<br/>- more than 10 types of unique mechanics;<br/>- meditative music that creates an additional atmosphere in the game;<br/>- support for color blindness mode.<br/><br/><br/>A little information about the work of the brain and neurons:<br/><br/>Our brain works much like a computer without the chip. Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system. They send and receive information in the form of electrical signals from the sensory organs, facilitating communication with the brain.<br/><br/>Nothing in the human body happens without the neurons knowing about it. Neurons perform the critical task of carrying information across the entirety of the human body.<br/><br/>The nerve cells transfer information by using both electrical and chemical signals.<br/><br/>The death of brain neurons can lead to irreversible diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease)<br/><br/>Do not forget to charge your brains! This is exactly what you need to do in the game, while simultaneously charging the neurons in real life!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T04:39:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/1367d76001826e0d90e46afe566f6c21_HX3qfMM.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nikolai Usachev"], "genres": ["Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nikolai Usachev"], "esrb_rating": null}
