As with a mechanical shooter, players can make the ball travel either \"soft\" or \"hard\" through the chute to aim for specific roll-over lanes by varying the amount of time the SHOOTER button is held before being released.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce the ball is in play, players must try to guide it into as many scoring areas as possible by hitting the ball with a FLIPPER to control its direction. Hit the ball early and it goes in one direction; hit it late and it goes in another. There are also six NUDGE points that allow for further ball control. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPoints can be earned during the game by hitting various scoring targets including BUMPERS, KNOCK-OUT gates and the KICKER target. Extra points can also be earned if some targets are lit up first. Refer to the included instruction guide for full details.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn addition to points automatically added during gameplay, BONUS POINTS are added at the end of each turn. To earn bonus points, up to 75000 per turn, the player must hit a series of combinations during the game (see instruction guide). \r\n</p><p>\r\nEach player receives 5 balls per game. When a ball is lost through one of the exit lanes, the next player gets a turn. After the last player has played their last ball, each player's score will be displayed in turn. The player with the highest score is the winner.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTips\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<p>\r\nWildfire can be played by up to 4 players at a time.
