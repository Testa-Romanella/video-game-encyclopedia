They will capture buildings that will increase your economy, buff your units, and give you a new frontline to spawn reinforcements on. Eventually making it to your enemy's base and destroying it to win.<h3>MULTIPLE DIFFERENT UNITS TO SPAWN</h3><br/>Spawn units like the Rookie that is a cheap infantry that can overwhelm your enemy. The Runner is a unit that moves fast and in unable to capture buildings so it is perfect for reinforcing a fight that you are losing. All while the Juggernaut is a low damage tank that can soak up tons of damage for a squad of units to back it up.<h3>SHORT MATCHES ON RANDOM MAPS</h3><br/>5 - 20 minute matches to fill in the small gap in your day were you have a little free time. This is not a game trying to take hundreds of hours of your life. No 2 maps are ever the same. Every time you load one up there will be different buildings in different places. 4 different maps sizes so you can choose how much time you wanna spend on a match.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T09:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/275d6c830129b9b789527c08c0dbda16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shane E."], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Shane E."], "esrb_rating": null}
