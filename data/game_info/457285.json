But all Billy wants to be is an Astrosaur.</p>\n<p>Made in 10 ish hours for the 22nd OC Tilted Shed Jam<br/></p>\n<p>The Game was made with the phrase \"Fierce Dinosaur\" and the\u00a0following random Mad Lib as a theme:</p>\n<p>One day I will visit space. I will build a rocketship that looks like a FABERGE EGG. I will EAT before blasting off in the rocketship. I will go past the INTEGRATED CIRCUIT and EXPLOSIONS in the sky. I will land on the moon. I will meet an alien named GAS MASK. The alien will teach me how to Be Fierce and Love Myself on the moon. I will say goodbye to the alien and and CIRCULATE back to the rocketship. When I get back to BANANA NOIR, I will see that the alien has given me a CONSPIRACY THEORY as a going-away present. I will happily CELBRATE before going to bed that night.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:43:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/764/7645e3c76993615ad45ce28b72aa2aea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Niborious"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
