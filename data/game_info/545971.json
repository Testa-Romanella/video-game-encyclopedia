The art work is not the best and is visibly something I need to improve upon but the game was a tonne of fun to make and I feel that the coding and interactions of the game works really well and all links in together. As a first project I understand I have a lot to work on and improve but I feel it went really well please give any additional feed back or possible improvements I myself may have not realised or noticed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:55:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd8/cd88b5574c77856b0a875de4a6970545.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dominic Turner"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
