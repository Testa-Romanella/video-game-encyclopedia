And you need to put each next parcel on time - because your car is always in motion.</p>\n<h3>Goal of the game</h3>\n<p>The road sections on the map need to be integrated into one and you must do this so that your car can drive to the finish line.</p>\n<p>There are three checkpoints on the way, but it&#39;s not so easy to get to them - you need to monitor the presence of gasoline. In addition, in the game you have rivals.</p>\n<h3>Pleasant surprises</h3>\n<p>Different power-ups will help you, allowing you to fill up a tank, slow down the course of time, get extra points, etc. They meet on the way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7d/c7d111f0aad385c5687735bd3ade7677.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.57, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 27, "owned": 1073, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 15}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 46, "suggestions_count": 349, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 46, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["30.06 Studios"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
