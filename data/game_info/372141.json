You travel across a map where terrain can affect your movement, stats, and other things.\u00a0\u00a0You'll pick up weapons and fight some monsters, your goal being to defeat the final terror that lies at the end. Combat uses a card system where your cards are given in a random order, you select one to use each turn, and are reshuffled after going through all of them. You can use weapons, armor, and other means to modify your deck and give yourself a leg up on the enemy. You might pick up some useful\u00a0mutations along the way, too.</p>\n<p>I should probably add a tutorial.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kirk and Rishabh for helping me out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:19:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09aac827586ed7477e93e4d3bf935ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Garin Jankowski"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
