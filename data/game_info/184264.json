Please note that this game is largely incomplete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A controller is required to play.</p>\n<p>With that said, we hope you all enjoy the game!</p>\n<p>- Team Tetra</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e145568df542dddcac30172510b2c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAGD"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
