Minerva. The crew is in cryosleep, bound for a distant asteroid. As the ship's 'caretaker bot', you are responsible for the allocation of the now-precious energy reserves. Solve puzzles by powering different objects around the ship and entering simulations created from the three crew members' memories. It is your task to ensure that all available power is concentrated in the crew life support systems, in the hope that they will be kept alive until rescue. But what if all the power on the ship simply isn't enough?\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:11:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b8d0522c081d2beecdaf0978329f8f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matthew Santiago"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
