There is no objective in the game yet, you just need to find your farm equipment and get farming (or swimming if you like to swim).</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Movement - ASDW</p>\n<p>Pick-up items - E</p>\n<p>Drop Items - Q</p>\n<p>Jump - Space bar</p>\n<p>Plant Crops - Left-click (mouse)</p>\n<p>Water Crops - Left-click (mouse)</p>\n<p>Harvest Crops - Left-click (mouse)</p>\n<p>Pause - P or Esc<br/></p>\n<p>Change Window Mode - Tab\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Note: You have to drop the tool in your hand and pick up a different tool to farm, water, or harvest your crops. For the game jam I thought this was good enough (but this will hopefully change in the future). <br/></p>\n<p>Don't forget to collect fish from the ocean! You can't do anything with them, but it's fun just to find them and pick them up. Happy farming/exploring, hope you enjoy the game!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:48:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f75a4675da11f83311e6fa2f9472db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StoreBoughtRocketGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
