Go through his nightmares, fighting his fears and gaining courage to level up and turn them into dreams.</p>\n<p>This is a game where you explore a rotative map that represents the imaginative and inconsistent state of mind that are dreams and nightmares. Fight enemies that represent fear and solve puzzles to get courage and level up your character.\r\n  </p>\n<p>In this game we are presenting a great challenge for the player since the map itself is already a puzzle. So, in addition to the other puzzles, where the player must place blocks in the right place to form a symbol, the player must think about how to move if he wants to go somewhere specific.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a game where the player is going to have to think and plan his moves.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:19:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/372/372d12ad1f12de5802a4f7cbf1de49da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PowerUpStudios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
