We liked this game so much as we decided to create a brand new version for year 2016.</p><p>The game has some new concepts, for example the battle plane has two portals on its end. The player can teleport their ship from one to another portal instantly. There is no infinite scrolling.</p><p>Still player has to catch falling humans but they cannot be released on the ground so it's easiest but controlling a spacecraft is more demanding.</p><p>By the way player can steering a ship with the XBOX 360 controller or keyboard.</p><p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d8f92ccef5deae723403779825917d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rozen Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
