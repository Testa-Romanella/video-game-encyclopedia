She lives in Tokyo, works at an office, and she whiles away her time playing MMOs. Aki isn\u2019t exactly happy with her lot in life, but it\u2019s all she knows, and she\u2019s too tired from work to change it.<br/><br/>Aki is the last person you\u2019d expect to go on a magical adventure\u2026<br/><br/>Until she gets hit by a truck.<br/><br/>After being mown down on her way home from work, Aki is summoned to the land of Anthem by a cat-eared witch called Mina.<br/><br/>Mina is a talented mage whose skills far outstrip most others. She promises she\u2019ll return Aki home in due course, after she\u2019s had a chance to replenish her magical energy, but she wants Aki to do her a favor first.<br/><br/>The priestess Luna, whom Mina was entrusted with taking care of, has been kidnapped by malevolent forces, and Mina has no idea where she is.<br/><br/>Mina enlists the help of Aki, our heroine, and Scarlet, a cheerful foxgirl, to track down Luna and punish the brigands who kidnapped her. Our trio\u2019s journey will be far from easy, however. Attacked by thieves, assaulted by slimes, and encumbered by Aki\u2019s own incompetence, Aki\u2019s new life in Anthem gets off to a poor start.<br/><br/>Can an awkward, unassuming office lady like Aki really become a hero?<br/><br/><br/>Aki is the unwilling heroine of our tale. She\u2019s quiet and soft-spoken, and she finds it hard to assert herself. Bullied by her co-workers and criticized by her parents for her lack of ambition, Aki struggles to see herself as a warrior.<br/><br/>Contrary to her demure appearance, however, Aki is handy with a sword, being a kendo champion in her teenage years. It\u2019s been a long time since she last wielded a blade, however, and Aki isn\u2019t too confident about her abilities.<br/><br/>Can she really pull this off?<br/><br/><br/>Mina is a highly talented mage, and she\u2019s the catalyst behind this tale.<br/><br/>Mina might be a prodigy, but she\u2019s proud and haughty alongside it. She\u2019s aware of her own strengths and she doesn\u2019t try to downplay them. As a result, she can come across as being arrogant.<br/><br/>Mina is cold and aloof to most people, but she absolutely adores Luna. She\u2019s determined to find Luna again, no matter how long it takes, and she doesn\u2019t care who she drags along with her.<br/><br/><br/>Scarlet is the third addition to Mina\u2019s party, and she she has no shortage of energy. She\u2019s a perpetually cheerful foxgirl who fancies herself as a brave knight, who was kicked out of her former party for being a little too enthusiastic while fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Scarlet is a fierce fighter who\u2019s an asset to have on the battlefield\u2026<br/><br/>When she isn\u2019t scuppering well-laid plans by charging in like a lunatic, that is.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-01T07:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dd588de2c84787614a191e20ebb1e3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Winged Cloud"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Winged Cloud"], "esrb_rating": null}
