Each room is either an arena room, where the player must survive long enough to spawn that room's boss, kill it and collect its key, or it is a puzzle room, in which the player must have every button down at the same time, all the while both navigating around, and using, gem-changing lasers, RESET buttons, and color-specific walls. The player must also decide to spend their hard-earned points on either saving their progress in this unforgiving game, or risking it all and purchasing a new skill from the ever-expanding skills tree, hoping they will reach the next room with enough points to save.</p>\n<p>Can you reach the end?</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n\n<p>Keyboard/Mouse:</p>\n<p>wasd-Player Movement</p>\n<p>Cursor-Player Aiming</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Shoot/Throw Gem/Key</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button- Reload</p>\n<p>Middle Mouse Button - Lock Cursor Position</p>\n\n<p>Controller (PC/PS3/PS4/XBOX):</p>\n<p>Left Stick-Player Movement</p>\n<p>Right Stick-Player Aiming</p>\n<p>Bottom Right Trigger-Shoot/Throw Gem/Key</p>\n<p>Button 1- Reload</p>\n<p>**PLEASE DONATE**</p>\n<p>**A NEW ROOM WILL BE ADDED FOR EVERY $5 MADE**</p>\n<p>***The game-play video is not of the most recent update***</p>\n<p>All proceeds go straight back into NONNATIVE to fund the development of an app, online play, and more rooms.</p>\n\n\n<p>Because this game is currently in development, it has a lot of room to sway.
