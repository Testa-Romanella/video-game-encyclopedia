Programmed from scratch after learning Javascript on Codecademy. Art is all hand-drawn by yours truly.</p>\n<p>This is also my submission\u00a0for the <em>\"Three days until Xmas Jam!\"</em>. I decided to do a twist on the <em>\"Let it snow!\"</em> limitation, i.e. <strong>let it snow food\u00a0\ud83e\udd53\ud83c\udf3d\ud83c\udf73</strong>, cos I wanted to dedicate this little game to my mum as a Christmas gift of sorts - she loves to cook and bake, thus the butter and various food\u00a0ingredients. Hope you enjoy playing it too!</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>Don't get hit by the falling ingredients! Use the left &amp; right arrow keys to make Butter slide across the pan.</li><li>Butter will shrink in size as time goes by, ending the game when it disappears from the pan. So, don't forget to press the spacebar to make Butter expand!</li><li>Log your high score in the comments section below :)</li></ul>\n<p>*This game is only playable on web browsers. It can't run on mobile phones.</p>\n<p>Audio credits:<br/>\"sizzle.wav\" - Butter Sizzling\u00a0by hmoosher,\u00a0https://freesound.org/s/382709<br/>\"tune.wav\" - Light Tune ~ No. 1 by\u00a0\u00a0Jamessi,\u00a0https://freesound.org/s/410520/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fad01dadb6dee5f5f8bda81032838a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kaelynmauve"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
