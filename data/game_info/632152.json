Beware of difficulty. It is recommended to play this game in TRUE full screen mode (i.e. hiding the address bar, etc), which can be achieved on most browsers by pressing F11 (and F11 again to exit full screen). Do not be alarmed if your cursor vanishes; this is intentional so that the pointer doesn't get in the way. It will reappear again if you exit full screen and move the mouse upward.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df4e7dffcee7c9603c1ebb7c4c32f80c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nekozuki"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
