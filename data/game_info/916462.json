It was quite a lot of work! (Even considering half of the game is retro with simple lines and shapes.) Gotta love bosca ceoil! And... yeah... some of those sfx may actually be my voice... I'll never tell which.....\u00a0LOL didn't have time to do proper foley work ;p</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T16:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/959/959c5f4f676211e81f7bcd7c4a900e8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Two Felt Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
