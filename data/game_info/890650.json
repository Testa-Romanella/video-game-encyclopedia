Its owner played it the whole day long. At the end of the day its battery is low and Nokia goes to sleep and starts dreaming.\u00a0The more you play the more psychedelic the game becomes. At the end you might ask yourself how you managed to get here ... like in dreams where you never remember how everything started. The Game has 3 dream phases:</p>\n<ol><li>Easy - get used to the controls (Buffer is cleared on each Frame)</li><li>Dream - try to remember where your snake is (Buffer is cleared when eating apples)</li><li>REM - rapid eye movement - are you overwhelmed? (Buffer is never cleared)</li></ol>\n<p>I first started with Korge as Game engine but at the end I came up with P5.js.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T09:15:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff7000d529972a6bb5a466521b9787f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlorianMarsch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
