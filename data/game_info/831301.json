The project is incomplete, and I unfortunately do not have plans to update the game in the near future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To start the game, first you need make an adventurer. Choose a name and then choose between 6 different classes and backgrounds, which will give you stats and equipment based on what you chose</p>\n<p>I was a little hasty in uploading the game, so beware of bugs (and typos)! Feel free to leave comments on the game's page. I might not be working on the game currently, but I would appreciate any advice or notes on how to improve it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pro tip: You can click anywhere on the game screen after inputting a number. This will let the game register your input as if you had pressed the Enter button.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Kirsty font by Typodermic Fonts.</li><li>Azoth's Cave made in Unity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/472/4726f5e5998304f2310ccf366c6fed6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mithrase"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
