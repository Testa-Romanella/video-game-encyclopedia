Ever since you were born, your parents knew your destiny. Gifted a huge sword by a bee in your infancy, you were placed among the many to be trained to protect those trees that couldn't protect themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try and protect your tree, but don't forget to stay alive in\u00a0<em>The Treekeeper.</em></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Try to keep your tree alive by maintaining its resources. Keep it watered by stepping in the water and then running to the watering can. Make sure it gets enough food by hitting the bushes to get chicken to bring to the tree, and make sure it gets sun by keeping the palm fronds at the top destroyed. You can get upgrades for your tree by hitting the fertilizer on the right.</p>\r\nInput\r\n<ul><li>Use WASD to move</li><li>Click to attack</li></ul>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Game Engine: Unity</li><li>Art: Aseprite</li><li>Music: Bosca Ceoil</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>Newgrounds</li><li>Ludum Dare</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:54:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b09/b093bf87519f8e683f20ab7d3bf23480.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Riley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
