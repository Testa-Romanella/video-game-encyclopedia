The main controls are WASD for moving around and Space bar for jumping (helps when getting stuck). These cute little critters will follow you around wherever you go, they need to be fed with fruits and cuddled or brought back home to your cave, to keep them warm, until they are big enough to fend for themselves.<br/><br/>Have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f33/f3383649449a73de921e84605e0f750a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Farelle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
