Find the key to unlock the exit and proceed through bright gardens, dark caves, deep space and Egyptian tombs!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li> True retro graphics: Every tree, spike and coin was created from a single 16 colour pallet to recreate that late 80's feel. </li>\n<li> Beeps and Boops: An original soundtrack of simple yet catchy music and colourful sound effects accompany Axel as he waddles through danger. </li>\n<li> Classic game-play: Springs, platforms, spikes, teleporters, snails...
