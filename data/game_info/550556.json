With each piece of artwork found, the artist comes one step closer to unlocking their forgotten inspiration, the glimpse of a newfound hope growing steadily brighter in front of them.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a single-player exploration game\u00a0featuring beautiful hand-drawn graphics and original music/sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given that there are nearly a million species of\u00a0insects accounting for over 80% of the world's living creatures, a few bugs are bound to have found their way into our game. If you report them in the comments, our dedicated team of exterminators (read: coders) will get on the job. Unless it's Bugmageddon. In that case, you best run for your lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:13:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9a2ffe26a24be51c663c5a792c59e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Molina", "Memodol", "aschweich", "Renrith", "AdreiDFK", "Eugenia Zanarini"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
