The idea was to put it out as a simple game for iOS. I got quite far in the development until I started to show it to players and soon I realized that the players didn't understand the controls on the phone (you were supposed to tap on the screen and not follow your finger). I still wanted to finish the game, but lost interest on it during the spring time, mainly because I realized that I really, really, don't like mobile games or making them. </p><p>Main lessons learned:<br/></p><ul><li>Do not create an isometric, side scroller, game in 2D (layering objects is hell in 2D space)</li><li>Test mobile games early, even if it's just blocks on your screen</li></ul><p>Finally I decided to kill the game to get some closure for the project; so here it is in its last shape.<br/></p><p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Either use arrow keys to move up and down, or click with mouse above or below the boat to move up/down.</p><p>If the game is too cropped, you can access with it a direct link here: https://itch.io/embed-upload/219917?color=333333<br/></p><p>Code by @fatsopanda<br/>Artwork by @ivdza_</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffbd49b35524763b837f22f90e5afae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fatsopanda"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
