And you'd have to hunt them down; probably in some kind of intense, pixelated, twin stick shooter.</p>\r\nChoose Your Champion\r\n<p>Select one of four different characters to match your play style (or master all of them, to prove your skills):</p>\n<p><strong>The barbarian</strong> is slow but sturdy, hurling massive axes towards their enemies and charging forward recklessly. There's also a lot of yelling. Deadly yelling.</p>\n<p><strong>The mage</strong> keeps their distance and blasts foes with arcane bolts that steer themselves to the nearest target. Hang back and shred the air with razor sharp magical shards.</p>\n<p><strong>The hunter</strong> darts in and out of combat, sniping at monsters with fast-firing and long-ranged arrows then darting out of the way.</p>\n<p><strong>The cleric's</strong> greatest strength is their faith, which happens to let them fill the air with spheres of holy light that explode and tear apart the creatures around them. When their devotion is especially strong, they might even be blessed with free armor.</p>\n<p>No matter which you choose, you'll level up as you fight through the Retromancer's forces, gaining damage bonuses and recovering armor as you go.</p>\r\nArm Yourself Against the Madness\r\n<p>Take advantage of weapons and power ups to deal more damage, fire faster, dodge enemies, and freeze monsters in their tracks.</p>\n<p>Unlock permanent upgrades between games that enhance each character's strengths: mages get even more rapid fire, clerics get more blessings from their gods, hunters become even more deadly at range, and barbarians yell louder than ever before!</p>\r\nDefy Death\r\n<p>A unique death's door mechanic gives you a fighting chance to come back from the brink of death.</p>\n<p>Even when your armor has been depleted, if you can survive without taking a final hit for a few moments, you'll recover and be able to continue the fight.</p>\r\nEnlist Your Friends\r\n<p>If the Retromancer is too much to tackle alone, you can recruit up to three friends in the local 4-player co-op mode.</p>\n<p>When you do have your friends with you, you'll be able to revive each other when you fall in battle, so you'll never be stuck fighting alone.</p>\r\nSurvive The Journey\r\n<p>Battle through 30 stages spread across 6 areas on the cursed island of Qor, challenging a vast array of crazed monsters ranging from rats and beetles to sentient trees and extra-dimensional horrors.</p>\n<p>Endure a plague of locusts in the haunted woods, overthrow a cultist army in the ruins, surrender your sanity to the creatures of the Void, and kill the Retromancer.</p>\r\nFeature Summary\r\n<ul>\n<li>4 characters to master</li>\n<li>Unique death's door and multi-player revival mechanics</li>\n<li>Up to 4 player local co-op</li>\n<li>Both controller and keyboard &amp; mouse support</li>\n<li>Over a dozen weapons and upgrades to unlock</li>\n<li>30 levels spread across 6 areas ranging from haunted woods to a cosmic void</li>\n<li>3 dozen monster types to conquer</li>\n<li>In-game bestiary with monster stats and details</li>\n<li>Feats and achievements to earn</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05a/05ab28e91d662a79491116c9bdf3b7c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spinfoam Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
