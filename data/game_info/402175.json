{"id": 402175, "slug": "voxel-works-quest", "name": "Voxel Works Quest", "name_original": "Voxel Works Quest", "description": "<p>Mine and craft in 6DoF, but it's real work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0A prototype for Jog-In-Place locomotion on <strong>Oculus Quest </strong>using the Godot game engine to explore an infinite procedurally generated voxel world.<br/></p><p>The main intend of this prototype is to explore physical interaction in VR with the world as much as possible. The movement system with the jog in place detection is a core aspect of this. I will try to improve it as much as possible with the feedback I get but for now it will not be replaced by a more traditional VR locomotion method.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<ul><li>Jog-In-Place to move forward</li><li>Mine voxels: hit them with a swing</li><li>Grab objects: usethe grab button (or a fist)</li><li>Inventory: open by rotating your palm upwards, switch slot with buttons/pinch</li><li>Crafting: you can craft on top of tree trunks. Hit the craft area after you have placed the items.</li><li>Climbing: grab voxels in the world</li></ul>\r\nSome Notes \r\n<p>This is an <strong>early version</strong> and there are not a lot of mechanics and items implemented yet. You can craft wood from a tree, sticks from wood and a wooden pick from two sticks and three wood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you find <strong>bugs </strong>please report them and I will try to fix them.</p>\n<p>I have of course a lot of things in mind that I would like to add if possible in the near future but if you have an idea and you think it is doable from an effort perspective let me know.\u00a0Some things I consider (besides the obvious things like more voxel types, items and crafting recipes) are improved landscape generation, day/night cycle and in the far future\u00a0 procedural quests (I chose the name for a reason ;-)</p>\n<p>This version has <strong>hand tracking</strong> enabled but keep in mind that you need good conditions for hand tracking to work reliably enough for gaming. Touch controllers is the recommended way to play.</p>\r\nCrafting Recipes:\r\n<p>There are not yet many recipes implemented (and they follow at the moment all the quite obvious reference). Here are some of them but note that this might change in a future update (but it will be documented then). Crafting works on top of tree trunks.</p>\r\n\r\nT = Treetrunk; W = Wood; S = Stick\r\nWood:         [T]   Stick:       [W]\r\nWoodaxe:    [W W -] Woodpick:  [W W W]\r\n            [W S -]            [- S -]\r\n            [- S -]            [- S -]\r\nWoodshovel: [- W -] Woodsword: [- W -]\r\n            [- S -]            [- W -]\r\n            [- S -]            [- S -]\r\n\r\nContact\r\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/NeoSpark314</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The prototype was made using the\u00a0Godot Game Engine,\u00a0the Godot\u00a0Oculus Quest Toolkit\u00a0 and\u00a0the Godot voxel module.</p>\n<p>The textures and sound effects used are from the minetest_game<br/>released under Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc0a321cae82369b2db3fe5c64be7f48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["NeoSpark314"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
