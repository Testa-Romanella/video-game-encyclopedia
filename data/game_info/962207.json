The goal is to create a game that\u2019s fun to watch and manage with lots of complexity and stat tracking. <br/><br/>After decades of hobby programming, I decided to finally release one of my games to the public following all of support from the Legend Bowl community for the Legend Bowl Franchise Mod I created.  This game will remain FREE.  I made FFFL: Brutalball Manager for myself and family.  We've played many seasons together online, and I just want to share the fun.  There are no plans for microtransactions, just a Supporter Pack for those that want some extra races and other goodies.<strong>Primary Features:</strong> <br/><strong>8 v 8 football, players play both sides of the ball </strong><br/><br/><strong>Fantasy races:</strong> Orcs, elves, dwarves etc. <br/><br/><strong>True Simulations:</strong> Simulated games use the exact same engine as games watched at normal speed <br/><br/><strong>Total control of all teams:</strong> You can assign AI to manage any aspect of the game at any time.

Stories and personalities are an important part of management sims</h3><br/>With most sports franchise games it is difficult to connect to all of the players in the league - often there is little to distinguish players beside numbers and a few facial features.  Fantasy races make for quicker connections and associations with the players, immediately giving them a bit more personality.  Also, adding things like player death is more fitting in a cartoon fantasy setting.  This also makes it easier to let go of American football conventions allowing for more rule innovations.  The driving goal of this game is for the off-season and game play to foster stories and memories.  Coupled with internally consistent stats and recording of major events each league should generate an interesting history.<br/><br/><strong>Example stories shared by beta testers:</strong><br/>\"Had a funny moment in a game earlier, in a blood thirsty sort of a way. One of my players killed an opponent who had previously spent multiple All-Pro seasons with my club before parting ways with us in the previous off-season. A pretty brutal way to treat a former team mate who left in free agency!\"<br/><br/>\"The Championship game was 4-4 after 100 plays and it was WILD! Four of my starters were injured including the league MVP. I had a little goblin come off the bench who hadn't played a down all year, only for him to spark the winning touchdown drive. We scored the walk-off title clinching TD 20 plays deep in OT\"<br/><br/>\"I'm currently in the midst of a truly brutal season! We're 1-5 having made it to the championship game last season and have lost to four teams with a worse overall rating. I've had three starters killed including my star player, a two time league MVP. I'm looking forward to a very high draft pick and a lower team salary at least!\"<h3>Races in the base game:</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-16T03:44:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57dbd7650f7f0fc9e9c189c747bca4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stout Kassel Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Stout Kassel Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
