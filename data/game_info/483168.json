The game text might have some typos, the interface needs more adjustment. Anyway you will be able to test out the idea.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/227/2272b2fc99bba5c17d6ad210ce178e6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["asahnoln"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
