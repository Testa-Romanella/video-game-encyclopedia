Come test your mettle and see how far \r\nalong the corridor you can go !\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCorridor 17 is a\r\n mix between endless runner and shoot 'em up. Your objective is to pilot\r\n your ship as far down the corridor as possible without dying. In your \r\nway are devious traps, obstacles and a mini (somewhat suicidal) robot \r\narmy. Fear not though, for between your superior flying skills and laser\r\n marksmanship, this should be a walk in the park .... right ?\r\n</p>\r\nDevices Required<ul>\n<li>Oculus Rift DK2</li>\n</ul>\r\nGameplay instructions\r\n<ul>\n<li>Pilot your ship using the Oculus Rift DK2's head tracking capabilities. Dodge \r\nobstacles by leaning left/right and raising/lowering your head. </li><li>Aim your lasers using the mouse and hold down left-click to fire.</li><li>For the speed junkies \r\namong us, we have also included \"Turbo Mode\" ! Give this a shot if the \r\ndefault flight speed puts you to sleep !</li>\n</ul>\r\nConfiguration Tips<ul>\n<li>If the Oculus camera goes out of sync for some reason, pressing ESC will restart the level and re-calibrate your ship's position.</li>\n</ul>\r\nDevelopment Team\r\n<ul>\n<li>David Ho (Programming/Game Design)</li>\n<li>Julian Chan (Level Design)Music By</li></ul><ul><li>Our Black Dolphins</li>\n</ul>\r\nBug Reporting<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you have a problem with the game, do not hesitate to drop us an email and we'll fix it as quickly as we can.
