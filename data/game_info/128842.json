My goal was to make a touch-friendly game for Mobile &amp; PC. Swipe across the main character to fling him/her into the air.</p><p>(Two fingers or left &amp; right mouse buttons + swipe up to push or swipe down to pull in the 3rd dimension.)</p><p>On the PC version there is the beginnings of a spline editor for platforms. Click and drag a yellow control circle with the left mouse button to reshape the platform. Right click a yellow control circle to toggle smooth/sharp corners. Press an arrow key to add a platform section.</p><p>Special Thanks to Edward Ikeguchi for giving permission to use the background image for this project, seen here:</p><p>https://theblablab.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/a-claw-is-born-and-some-game-art/<br/></p><p>The text is Japanese and says \"kani pinch\" which means \"crab pinch\" :)</p><p>Links:</p><p>www.davidlycan.com</p><p>https://twitter.com/dwlycan?lang=en<br/></p><p>http://davidlycan.deviantart.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89ccd4e51a53d98592c2fb00ed89467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["DavidLycan"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
