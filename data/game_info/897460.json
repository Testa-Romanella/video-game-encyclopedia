Ok, I'll be serious.</p>\n<p>Baldi's Basics Classic V1.0 but for masochists is a mod that ramps up the difficulty of BBC's\u00a0already infamously hard\u00a0V1.0. This mod is in development, as there are several things that are to be done. What things, you ask? Well, you don't want to know, hehe.<br/><br/>Here are the changes found in this mod so far:</p>\n<ul><li>Baldi moves quicker the angrier he gets, so Baldi's ruler slap rate isn't all you need to worry about!\r\n</li><li>Playtime will now come over to noises like doors opening (Yes, it includes NPCs opening them.), provided that she is ready to play, is close enough to them and isn't chasing a more important noise. If she's too far away from a noise but still relatively close to it, she has a chance to go there, which obviously decreases as she goes farther from it.\r\n</li><li>Please make a video or at least a voiceclip of your first reaction to the tape recordings.\r\n</li><li>It's a Bully will now alert Baldi (and Playtime, on conditions above) to his position when you collide with him.\r\n</li><li>The less your stamina is, the slower you are.\r\n</li><li>When Arts &amp; Crafters catches you, Baldi will get much angrier. The lower your stamina is, the angrier he gets!\r\n</li><li>There's crack in Energy Flavored Zesty Bars, hehe. They also now only set your stamina to 100% rather than 200%.\r\n</li><li>Baldi gets slightly angrier when a BSODA spray touches him.\r\n</li><li>Playtime waits 30 seconds before she goes invisible and mute for 15 seconds, or until she catches you, which restarts the cycle.\r\n</li><li>Eating Energy Flavored Zesty Bars in front of the Principal is worse than any other offense. See the V0.2 changelog for details.\r\n</li><li>Goodbye, giant globes in the Principal's office!</li><li>It's a Bully spawns much more quickly after deactivating. He can also take up to 3 items from you\u00a0at once!<br/>\n</li><li>The more notebooks you have, the shorter the Yellow Door Lock locks swinging doors.<br/>\n</li><li>Previously locked doors unlocked with the Key will close after a third of a second and lock again and you can't delay that by clicking on them.\r\n</li><li>You have to go to the 4 exits twice to exit the school.\r\n</li><li>Jumping in Playtime's minigame will decrease your stamina.\r\n</li><li>The more notebooks you have, the more times you have to jump in her minigame.\r\n</li><li>Gotta Sweep takes much shorter to activate and sweeps for much longer.\u00a0This change was inspired by Benefond's idea where Gotta Sweep never stops sweeping.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Please give me evil ideas in Gamebanana DMs, not in the public comments.</strong> If you want BBC V1.0, you can get it\u00a0here. If you're looking for the Gamebanana page, it's\u00a0here. Also, please send me videos of the mod others have made!\u00a0Anyways, I hope you're a masochist! That's all I have to say!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T11:31:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/569/569ff3c0aff9229c56787ad051e20c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CreeperExplodeMakesGames1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
