A mobile \ud83d\udcf1 puzzle game in which you're a cute little dog \ud83d\udc36 who needs to feed your children \ud83d\udc15.</p>\n<p>You have to pick up all your children and then get them all on their food plate, easy right? Well yeah, BUT... You can't move to a place in which one of your children already is.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can move using the arrow keys on your keyboard and R to restart the level... For now, that's all xD.</p>\n<p>Even though this game is meant to be played on smartphones, I've decided to upload a web version here so people can test it out and let me know what they think.</p>\n<p>Please don't hesitate to let any kind of feedback. The whole idea of uploading a web version here is to know if people like the game, find bugs, and improve the game overall.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMERS:</strong></p>\n<p>Only 3 levels for now, more levels are coming soon.</p>\n<p>For now, this is just a side-project of mine, I do have the intention to release this game to Google Play and the App Store but right now I cannot give any release date.</p>\n<p>Sorry in advance for the bugs, spelling errors, and the fact that the game is in Spanish(my native language).</p>\n<p>I'm also planning to create a devlog here so I can share some progress every now and then.</p>\n<p><strong>DONATIONS?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for been reading this far! I'm a full-time software developer so right now I can only work on this game in my free time, since I normally work per hour, every dollar donated means that I can spend more time working on the game. It also helps me to keep motivated since this is a passion project that I would like to spend all the necessary time on in order to get the best version of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:42:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/221d98fce09060c84b00e2dc58c54c08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mejia Tavarez Software and More"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
