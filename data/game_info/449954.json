{"id": 449954, "slug": "mfa-prep-course", "name": "MFA Prep Course", "name_original": "MFA Prep Course", "description": "<p><em>MFA Prep Course</em> is an artist simulator and training application for those seriously considering advanced degrees in the field of visual arts.</p>\n<p>For gallery exhibitions,\u00a0the game is played with a dual analogue controller. The two arms are controlled with the two analogue sticks respectively. The buttons on the right and left analogue sticks control the picking up and dropping of items for the corresponding hand. The home version uses wasd + space and the mouse.</p>\n<p><em>MFA Prep Course</em> was created in the winter of 2010 by Marek Kapolka\u00a0and John Bruneau. It was exhibited at\u00a0Works/San Jose that same year as part of <em>Ring in the New</em>. In 2011 is was shown as part of the <em>SxM Guild</em> official selection in the Black Gallery at San Jose State University.<br/><br/></p>\r\nThe work is an interactive exploration of the idealized life of an artist. It is a game in so far as it occupies the same sociological slot that a game does- it is an escape from the drudgery of daily life, and allows the player to live the fulfilling and relaxing life that they wished they could. The game richly simulates the experience of drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. Individual cigarettes will burn out, and individual cups of coffee will be depleted, but there are always more cigarettes in the box, and more coffee available in the machine, thus the pleasure and angst of completing a cup of coffee or cigarette are captured, but not the terror of running out for good.<br/>\r\n- Marek Kapolka\r\n\r\nAwards\r\n<p>Second Place Finalist, \"MFA Prep Course\", Games Category, CSU Media Arts Festival, California State University Fullerton. 2011\r\n</p>\r\nExhibitions\r\n<p><em>SxM Guild Show</em>, \"MFA Prep Course,\" Black Gallery, San Jose State University, San Jose, CA. curators: Cody McCabe and Tamara Hoyt. 2011 (juried) \r\n</p>\n<p><em>Ring in the New</em>, \"MFA Prep Course,\" Works Gallery, San Jose, CA. 2010 (member\u2019s exhibition) \r\n</p>\r\nBibliography &amp; Press\r\n<p>Tim Wee, \"Browser Game Pick: MFA Prep Course (Marek Kapolka and John Bruneau),\" <em>Indie Games</em>, Jul 18, 2011\r\n</p>\n<p>Pietro Polsinelli, \"Five smart, different, creative indie browser games,\" <em>Gamamoto</em>, Sep 1, 2011\r\n</p>\n<p>Octavio Ortega, \"MFA Prep Course,\" <em>Gizmos</em>, Jul 19, 2011</p>\n<p>Victor Rosso, \"One of the biggest jokes in the flash game world,\" <em>Sens Critique</em>, Aug 24, 2013\r\n</p>\n<p>Chad Comeau, \"Fun Free Browser Games,\" <em>Fring Frang</em>, Aug 07, 2013\r\n</p>\n<p>Pierre Corbinais, \"MFA Prep Course,\" <em>l\u2019Oujevipo</em>, Jul 22, 2011\r\n</p>\n<p>Victor Depardieu, \"MFA Prep Course, l'\u00e9norme foutage de gueule vid\u00e9oludique,\" <em>Le Blog d'un Cochon Aviateur au Nom Hybride</em>, Sep 7, 2013\r\n</p>\n<p>Lewis Denby, \"This week's best free PC games,\" <em>PC Gamer</em>, Jul 22, 2011 (archived pdf)</p>\n<p>Herr Fabu, \"MFA Prep Course,\" <em>Superlevel</em>, Jul 18, 2011 (archived pdf)</p>\n<p>Florian Bayer, \"Antispiel: MFA Prep Course ,\" <em>Site 360</em>, Jul 18, 2011 (archived pdf)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T05:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d49af70a3d240ad6d2d5db3a82b1dc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Marek Kapolka", "Artfail"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
