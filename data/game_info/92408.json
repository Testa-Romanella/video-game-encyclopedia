You'll have to learn the rules of this world by yourself and use it for your advantages or fail.\r\nAt some moments, you may even think the game is broken.\r\nIt just means that you miss something and you need to keep looking.</p>\r\nONLINE MULTIPLAYER\r\n<p>In your journey, you can meet other players but current build\r\nof the game is not focused on multiplayer aspects.
