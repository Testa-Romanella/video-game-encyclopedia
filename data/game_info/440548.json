The theme was \"Invisible\", hence why the player can't see what is directly around them for the maze.</p>\n<p><strong>A Memory of Mazes<br/></strong>Chill out, relax, and play some maze levels, with a total of 10. Go to the yellow blocks to unblock some pathway. There are some timing blocks that will go off and on at a 1 second interval.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions<br/></strong>WASD or Arrow keys to move. Press ESC to pause and go to the menu.</p>\n\n<p>All work done by me, Gregory Weber.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:20:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06d4c2eb327af41b69b5e31271823598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gregoryweber"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
