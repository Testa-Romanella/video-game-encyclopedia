As the White or the Red Army, the players try to radicalize and recruit civilians during the russian civil war. The collected civilians can be used as ammunition to decimate the other's numbers.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of all levels is to be the first to collect a set number of civilians before the other player can. But think: If you \"throw away\" too many of your people to slow down the enemy, it might happen that there is nobody left to be radicalized, and death, the invisible third player, wins the game.</p>\n<p>The game is designed to follow the russian constructivism aesthetics of propaganda posters by El Lissitzky from the year 1919, which were of central meaning to the Bauhaus movement. Lissitzky was rooting for the Red Army.</p>\n<p>After every level, the players will find a fragment of the civil war story to reflect on their cruel role in this game. Which ways of action are left to actors in a society where everyone is radicalized? Will you, the players, go with the BEAT or not?<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5cc1562899417c96a6763130923acd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Topicbird"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
