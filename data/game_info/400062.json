It is a relaxing and brain training match 3 number game. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Just swap 2 numbers in any direction to match 3 or more same adjacent numbers horizontally and vertically. Then, they will be merged at their most far right-bottom tile so that their sum is converted to the nearest number of the series [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ..., 1024, 2048, ...]. It is the repeated multiplication of number 2.</p>\n\n<p>Google Play Store: Swap n Merge Numbers 2048</p>\n<p>Amazon Appstore: Swap n Merge Numbers 2048</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Simple rules:</p>\n<p>- No automatic swap-back even there is no match.</p>\n<p>- Every match gives 1 star.</p>\n<p>- Every swap without match costs 5 points. The cost is incremented by 5 points every level.</p>\n<p>- It costs 100 stars to remove a number from the grid using the Remove button.</p>\n<p>- The game is over when you run out of tries and stars.</p>\n<p>- It is your responsibility to save your progress to resume it later by hitting the Save button.</p>\n\n<p>Every new level: minimum and maximum generated numbers are increased by multiplying them by 2. So try to match all minimum numbers before the next level because they will not be generated again.</p>\n\n<p>Play, enjoy and have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:43:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97a1219da410ed5f83a6a05f7b9c1b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ganaysa"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
