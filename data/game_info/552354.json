Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Blackthornprod game jam. Following along with the jam's theme \"Less is More\", it ended up being incorporated into the story as a whole than a mechanic.\u00a0I would consider this game more of an episode rather than a full story due to 5 out of the 7 jam days I was able to work on it. Music, sprite and art graphics are made completely by me. The sound effects default presets from RPG Maker 2003!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/022/022502f4db115f47d5308f5f6fc54d54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RomVHS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
