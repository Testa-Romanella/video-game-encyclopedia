You run around in a 3D world but you can only play in 2D. The world made out of grass and dirt with trees on it to give the illusion of a small forest. Over you will enemy guns spawn and they will shoot at you (therefore Dodge the Bullets). You can shoot the enemy guns with your gun. There will spawn ammo boxes and medic kits that you can pick up. In the top left corner, is a timer counting the time you survive.
