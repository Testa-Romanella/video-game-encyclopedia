This is a puzzel game with a few basic mechanics and a fully working menu system and pause screen. We have only 2 levels because we ran out of time at the end but have the assets to make more. Its the story of a Black hole and their friend where one has been kidnapped and you are trying to save them. You need keys to open doors and be careful not to suck students in. If you eat a muffin your range for killing students decreases so you can get past them easyer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2</p>\n\n<p>By Tom and Max</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T08:56:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffe88644b5d070e8b01f3aef846e978b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tom_llong"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
