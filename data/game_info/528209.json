{"id": 528209, "slug": "college-escape", "name": "College Escape", "name_original": "College Escape", "description": "<p>You find yourself locked in your college and don\u2019t know how to escape from it. Luckily for you, you are not alone. By your side, there is nothing less than another classmate, who shares with you the same troublesome situation. As they say, united in misfortune! Will you manage to collaborate and rely on each other in order to escape together? To find it out, wear your school attire and remember: trust and communication are the winning card to overcome this challenge!<br/></p>\n<p><em>College Escape</em> is a 2D cooperative escape the room game, which features an online multiplayer for two players only. The goal is quite straightforward: collaborate and communicate with your classmate in order to escape the building you are locked in. Before starting a new game, each player has to join the same room to play together. Since communication is required and mandatory to make any progress in the game, external programs such as Discord are necessary due to the absence of an internal chat.</p>\n<p>On their way to the exit, players will be engaged in incremental challenging puzzles and riddles distributed in different rooms, whose solution has to be searched by the other player (or not!) and vice versa. Puzzles generally require the interaction of one player or both with almost one mechanic (for instance, a button or a plate) in order to be solved. Solving a puzzle will grant access to one or more rooms, thus allowing players to further progress towards the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Control scheme</strong></p>\n<ul><li>W = move up</li><li>A = move left</li><li>S = move down</li><li>D = move right</li><li>E = interact</li></ul>\n<p>Due to the possibility of remaining stuck inside walls, another set of commands is available: I, J, K, L which act respectively as W, A, S, D. These keys allow the player to move the character by a fixed amount in each direction. Please note that these commands also may allow a character to move outside the map, so use them only when needed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game relies on an external service to perform its multiplayer functionalities. We do not take any responsibility related to networking issues.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The current version is a prototype, and for this reason it features only the strict amount of rooms needed to test each mechanic implemented so far and lacks any complexity as regards the map layout. Please remember that this version does not reflect how the final version will look like.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T05:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff1/ff1a955e032f2e25eba8a9f4447c4358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
