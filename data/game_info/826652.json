This behavior will not be tolerated and will be addressed at a future date. Please remember to report any workplace health concerns related to Cheryl\u2019s rampage directly to HR so we can throw them directly in the trash.\u00a0<br/><br/>\n</li><li>Veteran Employee Frank will not stop staring directly into the player\u2019s eyes after a successful drop and whispering sweet nothings into their ear. It is making the new hires uncomfortable. Appropriate action will not be taken. Keep up the good work, Frank.<br/><br/>\n</li><li>We have received reports that some depots refuse to populate with more jobs. This is an error and not at all a result of depot worker strikes, but hey, nobody likes that district anyways.</li><li>On rare occasions, delivery drivers report nearly being thrown into orbit due to strange interactions with their Extendo-Arms\u2122\ufe0f. For ease of delivery, Go-Go-Listo does not recommend delivery drivers launch themselves into orbit. It is unclear whether or not delivery drivers can survive in orbit. More testing is needed.</li></ul>\n<p>\tSincerely,\u00a0<br/>Go-Go Listo Corporate</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T14:10:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6af5c34f8437b5a56074a1d3c53e5382.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Centauri Interactive", "Honeydatura", "chibaneon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
