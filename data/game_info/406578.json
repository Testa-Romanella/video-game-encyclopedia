Before this, I had never finished a game by myself, let alone one in such a short amount of time. I've been learning Unreal Engine for a little over 6 months now, and this project was a wonderful way to showcase the work I've put in and knowledge I've acquired while also giving me clear indication as to what areas I need to improve in. Thank you for taking the time to check it out! PLEASE don't hesitate to share your high scores with me in an itch.io comment or a tweet!</p>\n<p>My Twitter: @ElkGSamoe<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a308528b42db6603450bde153735db6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samoe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
