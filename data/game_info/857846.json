(Jam version)", "description": "<p>While everyone was enjoying summer, the Bookmaster was sorting. And sorting. And cleaning. And sorting again. Checking, very carefully, every inch of every\u00a0single book from his library. Everything got inspected.<br/><br/>And, suddenly, the worst happened :\u00a0Autumn came back.<br/>Everyone in town went frenzy,\u00a0wanting to get ready for a cozy season.</p>\n<p>Help the Bookmaster to survive this very very\u00a0dangerous day.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This small game version\u00a0has been created\u00a0for the\u00a0<em>Cozy Autumn Game Jam 2022.\u00a0</em><br/>The theme selected for the jam was\u00a0\"COZY\u00a0AUTUMN\" (no surprise so far !). This theme triggered the idea of \"everyone wanting to get an appropriate\u00a0book collection at the same time, right when Autumn starts. A situation which might be quite challenging for a librarian\".<br/><br/>I decided to implement game mechanics that are very close to a board game that I like (Bazar Bizarre), with a focus on\u00a0providing\u00a0the player with a similar feeling : having to make supposedly easy choices, based on observation and with\u00a0some time pressure. As usual, with Arcade Eleven : the game has to be arcade/action-oriented, interesting approach when combined with the \"cozy\" aspect, which I tried to reflect everywhere except in gameplay.<br/><br/>My personal challenge here, was to test some coding practices. Using variables with events &amp; delegates, and settings \"clever\" difficulty mechanics on randomized items, what I did with the books spawning rules. <br/><br/>Last : the fun.\u00a0I also wanted to try basic pixel art, what I usually skip/outsource. I went for fantasy graphics, which allowed some basic but enjoyable\u00a0work on\u00a0the books. My time being limited for this jam, fantasy was convenient since great fantasy assets under CC0 are pretty easy to find. I just had to recolor them, to match the color palette constraint included in the jam. Along with the fantasy direction, the librarian was promoted \"Bookmaster\". Congratulations to him.<br/></p>\n<p>Arcade Eleven is a young game development studio, consisting in 1 guy and some casuals friends/guests/contributors.\u00a0If you want to support us, the best way is to share the game to some friends, as well as\u00a0to follow us\u00a0to keep informed about upcoming releases. Leaving a comment is always a great source of motivation, and it also helps us to see if there's an interested in going further with the game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The JAM version is using several assets\u00a0under CC licence.
