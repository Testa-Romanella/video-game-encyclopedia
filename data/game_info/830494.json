Just get the highest score possible!</strong><br/><br/>I managed to get a lot of experience for this Weekly Game Jam! I couldn't finish the previous one at all and had a hard time finishing its mechanics. So, I decided to change the engine and give Godot a try! There were some things that I had a hard time with but I prevailed! <br/><br/>It is unfortunate that I couldn't make some music and sound effects since\u00a0 I have experience in music and sound design. There are things that need to get fixed though which are:<br/><br/>- Fix UI</p>\n<p>- Make the gameplay better</p>\n<p>- Fix particles</p>\n<p>-Add a water trail on the boat</p>\n<p>-Sound Effects</p>\n<p>-Music<br/><br/><strong>I tried to upload an HTML file but I couldn't make it work.
