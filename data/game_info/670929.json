Weather will affect the living conditions of animals and the overall capacity of the environment. At the end of each round, the species and opacity on the island\u00a0will change.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The number of changes depends on the following factors: under the premise that the total number of animals does not exceed the overall capacity of the environment, the reproduction rate will affect the population size of the next round; carnivores will be affected The effect of hunger, and the herbivores in the scene provide food for the carnivores. If the amount of food provided is less than the needs of the carnivores, the carnivores will starve to death. In the process of the game, players need to focus on the species diversity of the current island, so that there are as many species as possible on the island. In addition, the number of species should also be considered. In the game settlement panel, the factors that affect the score are also the above two points. Taking into account the factors of randomness, players must continue to play the game to obtain higher scores.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T03:17:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dec/decc2a6ecec5f794d859c6198047f6e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["whaleOMO"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
