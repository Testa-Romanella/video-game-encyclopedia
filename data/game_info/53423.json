{"id": 53423, "slug": "midnight-club-street-racing", "name": "Midnight Club: Street Racing", "name_original": "Midnight Club: Street Racing", "description": "<p>Midnight Club: Street Racing is a racing arcade game, developed by Angel Studios and published by Rockstar Games. The game focuses on competitive street racing and the import scene. The game was released for the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance platforms, the former being a launch title for the platform. It is the first game in Midnight Club franchise, followed by Midnight Club II.<br />\nThe title of this series is a reference to the Japanese street racing team\u00a0Mid Night Club. In the late 90&#39;s, they were infamous for their high-speed runs down the Bayshore Route on Tokyo&#39;s Shuto Expressway, which is why the &quot;Wangan&quot; (Bayshore) kanji is also included in the title, although it is also a shout-out to\u00a0Wangan Midnight, as the &quot;midnight&quot; portion of the logo is stylized similarly. Curiously the few Japanese releases of the\u00a0Midnight Club\u00a0games (the first game and both\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0and\u00a0LA Remix) omit the kanji from the logo, presumably to avoid potential rights issues with\u00a0Wangan Midnight\u00a0rights owners Kodansha.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2000-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T20:27:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f32/f32a2462e6d21fa3010e6573d62e5734.jpg", "website": "https://www.rockstargames.com/games/midnightclub", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 5, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 6, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Rebellion", "Rockstar San Diego", "Angel Studios"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games", "Destination Software"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
