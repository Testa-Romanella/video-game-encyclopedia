The main mission of the players is to find the mothership in the space full of Centripedes. In space, players will face some space creatures called Centripedes that will attack players. Players can kill them by using a laser gun. Sometimes the Centripede is hard to kill, so the players need to charge the laser gun so that they deal more damage to them. Players will find some \u201cclues\u201d when roaming in the space. These things can help players to find the mothership and start the boss fight once they collect enough clues. The game aims to provide players with an interesting experience of exploring and fighting in space.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move:\u00a0 WASD</p>\n<p>Boost:\u00a0 Space</p>\n<p>Aim:\u00a0 Mouse</p>\n<p>Fire Laser:\u00a0 Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Charge Laser (Spin the ship 360 with right mouse down to charge):\u00a0 Right Mouse Button</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Michael Anderson\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Jamie Carmichael</p>\n<p>Sam Yeung\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T08:26:17", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JamieCarmichael"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
