I\u2019m Maria, I\u2019m a 22-year-old and I have just finished my Game Design study program. I have worked with Unity for about four years  now and am happy to show what I have learned in this Game Jam. I wrote  the game\u2019s code, implemented to Assets &amp; the UI and made the  VFX/Shaders/Materials for the game. Everything I did in the project was  created during the jam.    </p>\n<p>Hello, Daniel here. I am 20 years old and currently working as a web designer. My job was to create the art for the game - this  includes the initial concepts, 3D models, textures, UI, artwork,  sound effects as well as music. On the last day of the jam, I  also focused on the presentation of the game online. The game assets  were created in blender, the music was made in GarageBand. We have used  sound effects from online sources that require no crediting.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing and commenting!<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33e/33e1cc36ef1acd58d88436b03e1ceb44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["tranquilmage", "linkiba"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
