Instead of a last meal, you're offered one last moment with the artwork of your choice.\"<br/></p>\n<p>What is art to you? How would you face death, despair, ineluctibility? What does your senses reveal or hide about our world? Is there a way for you to survive? Should you even try?<br/></p>\n\n<p>This work was created to validate a course and is my first game ever. It's not much: all I hope is that it provides an enjoyable moment of heartfelt reflexion. Some parts may touch your heart, other may seem completely absurd. It's part of the experience: art is a state of mind and no two people will feel the same thing at the same time.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game contains nine different endings. Each path takes only a few minutes to be completed. Overall, expect less than 20 minutes of gameplay,.</p>\n<p>For any inquiry, remark, advice, please seek @maurel_perrine on Twitter.<br/></p>\n<p>TW: Death mention, body horror<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T10:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de6/de62001fbaee8e917e17d2f04a411aaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BlueBleuViolet.te"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
