To our surprise, there has never been a game based on <em>The Last Unicorn</em>! We set a goal of making a small Zelda-like 2D action game that loosely follows the plot of the film. After 24 hours, the result was a prototype of such a game, consisting of one complete area, two screens of the first \"dungeon\", one enemy, and an animated unicorn sprite with one attack.</p><p>Credits:<br/>Mila Pokorny: Art, Design</p><p>Jill Leonardi: Design, Level layouts, music selection</p><p>Alex Raymond: Programming</p><p>Special thanks to Steve Pettit, Keith Maggio, and Sebastian Hanlon for answering my Unity and programming questions :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c2/0c24b0931455a80a4945da679bce03f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eleniel"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
