If it isn't meat he doesn't want it since it will make his 'stache fall out. Dodge running Grapples and shooting Watermelgnomes as you make your way to the finish to \"shave\" your 'stache.</p>\n<p>This is literally my first game jam, and while we had idea's we had to drop due to time, I'm pretty happy with the result. I'm working on other games, but this quick platformer, while not perfect, was a fun way to reset myself. Feels good to finally be able to show off a game I made too. May revisit this and add more to it post-jam.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys (or WASD) to move</p>\n<p>L\u00a0to Die</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming: Brian \"Bridiogames\" Diomede (Me)</p>\n<p>Art: Nick Nunez</p>\n<p>Sound Effects from zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T03:41:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649e85d9dfecc69d15e0364dab2d05f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bridiogames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
