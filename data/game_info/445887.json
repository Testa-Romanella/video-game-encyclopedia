There is some merit to the current system, as it can throw your concentration, which mimics the overall metaphor, probably more effectively, than the softer transitions I\u00a0was aiming for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Likely to work on this idea again in the future, but not this specific iteration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3d/c3d2142220580ab9ae019f6b49f15b88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Layalas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
