However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>Tzar Yaromir has given you the rich province of Cologreve for your own but its current three governors, the crime bosses Kratov, known as the Godfather, Strong Arm the Dwarf and the Fairy Godmother, have vowed not to give up control of the province without a fight.<br/>They plot to gain independence from the Tzar and they, along with Kozney the Deathless, have put a price on your head. Meanwhile, Kozney wants the throne of Lukomorye with a beautiful queen by his side. His minions have captured Princess Vasilisa.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Luko III\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 50 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T04:15:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9dfd48a0a6f92def725390e2304ba8d5_SIxWnDE.jpg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
