With money being your life you can't just let them take it. So you defend it viciously with your only weapon: a teacup. But be warned, the monsters are growing ever stronger, so you must too. Be careful though, strength comes with a price, just be sure you can pay that price.</p>\n<p>This is my first ludum dare, and my first game using Unity. I must admit I am surprised that I made it. So of course I am jumping off the walls (mentally) from pent up tension. Anyways, I hope you like my game, I'm\u00a0 going to go pass out now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Xbox one controllers are supported, not sure about other controllers)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T11:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b1/8b1d2db43b49e9d436d6f94edeb467be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Pocket Fun"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
