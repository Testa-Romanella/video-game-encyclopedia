There are asteroids! You need to destroy the asteroids for some reason!</p>\n<p>This reboot of the classic arcade game tries to hew close to the original. Shoot asteroids to earn points. But be careful! Shooting larger asteroids causes them to break off into two smaller asteroids, multiplying your problems.</p>\n<p>And watch out for flying saucers! They don't like you! The big saucers fire randomly and make for easy targets, but the small saucers are hard to hit and have deadly aim. Be careful!</p>\n<p>In a tight spot? Jump into hyperspace! But without precise calculations, you could fly right through an asteroid or bounce too close to a flying saucer, and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? Only use hyperspace as a last resort!</p>\r\nPoints\r\n<ul>\n<li>Large Asteroids\u201420 Points</li>\n<li>Medium Asteroids\u201450 Points</li>\n<li>Small Asteroids\u2014100 Points</li>\n<li>Large Saucers\u2014200 Points</li>\n<li>Small Saucers\u20141,000 Points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are awarded an extra ship for every 10,000 points you score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T09:10:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/3538ed851b633024144dcac1d4e84752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GenRelativity"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
