Often, I struggle with the pace at which the world progresses, and I forget to look around me and see that which I love so so much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rise in Fall originally started as a single improvisation session on my piano. I sat down and thought through three different phases in my thoughts. One was melancholy, one was sad, and one was happy. I find my thoughts are easy to drift any one way so quickly, so I figured I could show these ideas through an interactive art piece. It has been a while since I've created something entirely by myself, and I feel in finally doing so, this art piece is in a lot of ways, me.\u00a0I hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Kevin Sadi</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9f/a9f9c2fc661b00cf039c448807d1128f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kekkekin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
