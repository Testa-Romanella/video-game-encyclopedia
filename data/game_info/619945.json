I had so many ideas for the first day and i tried many of them but with my current skillset i couldn't create any of them like a snake game / jumpking hybrid.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the bad art I'm not an artist and I had 10\u00a0 minutes to make the menu and once again I'm not an artist and to make sure i finish on time I made it barebones.</p>\n<p>My interpretation of joined together is that the hooks join to cube to the wall. Its a pretty big stretch but because of all the testing i did on the first day I only had 20 hrs to do this and this is my first time building a game without much help. I did have to watch a video of grapple mechanics because my code would slingshot the player.</p>\n\n<p>Once again thank you &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:46:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47c24c83d5777fec7f77a511dac1b84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["<3 Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
