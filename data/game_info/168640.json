Navigate a virtual playground with other users and collect as many stars as you can in two minutes. If there\u2019s a enough time before the bell rings, why not partake in some throwback recess activities like swooshing down the slide, swinging on the swing set, soaring off the see saw or even dodgeball. And if you're feeling adventurous, sneak out of the schoolyard and play in the secret Pirate Ship and Castle! It\u2019s recess. Have fun!
