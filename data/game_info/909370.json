While working on this project, I learned a lot about game development and had a lot of fun in the process. Unfortunately, I missed the deadline for the game jam that I was planning to submit to, but I hope that you will still enjoy playing it.-_-</p>\n<p>In this 2D spider game, you play as a little spider who wants to go into the computer to fix the web. Use your grappling hook thingy to navigate through the platforms and overcome obstacles. Please be aware that the game may be lacking in certain areas. I would love to hear your feedback on how I can improve it.\r\n</p>\n<p>A little Web Problem is available for download on Windows. Have fun playing!\"\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:09:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/218282632155fa5cf16508ac41441551.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["seydiss"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
