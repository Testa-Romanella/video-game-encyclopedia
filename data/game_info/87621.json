Free is the #2 free app in the UK!<br/><br/>This is the full version of Will It Fly, with nearly 70 different takeoff scenarios.  <br/><br/>As a bush pilot of a small aircraft you must take off with as much cargo and as many passengers as you safely can, while avoiding terrain and obstacles.  Earn points by pushing your airplane to it's limit, but beware:  The more you carry, the worse your aircraft will perform!<br/><br/>How many passengers and how much cargo can you successfully take off with, and still outclimb obstacles and terrain? This game applies the real-world laws of aviation to a variety of challenging scenarios. <br/><br/>As in the real world of flying, a headwind can be your ally. Wind reduces the speed at which you travel over ground, but it does not affect climb speed, so a strong headwind can provide pilots with a steep climb angle.<br/><br/>Hot, High, and Heavy. Any combination of these can produce disasterous results. Hot or high atmospheric conditions indicate thin air, which reduces aircraft performance by lengthening the takeoff roll and reducing your climb angle. Too much weight will have the same effect on aircraft performance.<br/><br/>Be sure to check out Airport Madness Mobile and Airport Madness Challenge!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3e383a212e32a30c0c5226cb3345f65.jpg", "website": "http://fluik.com/wif.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fluik"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Fluik Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
