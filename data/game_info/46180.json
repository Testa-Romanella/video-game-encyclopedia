You have become an agent of death: a Reaper. You have the powers of death, but there are rules in this supernatural afterlife.<br/><br/>Reapers can cause death, but they cannot control humans directly due to the Free Will Clause. As a reaper, you must plan, time, and execute your killings by using the environment to your advantage. Be wary, Minions of Light work against you and will try and save humans from their grim fate!.Key Features<ul><strong>\u25cf  Isometric \u2018God\u2019 Perspective</strong></ul>Look down on your hunting grounds from a top-down perspective. Follow the lives of your targets and those out to stop your reaping.<br/><br/><ul><strong>\u25cf  Non-linear Design</strong></ul>There isn\u2019t a singular solution and a single item can kill multiple targets. Each level has a sandbox-esque design. So it\u2019s up to you to use whatever way you wish to complete your objective.<br/><br/><ul><strong>\u25cf  Observe, Plan, Execute</strong></ul>Observe the pattern of victims to know their behaviors and characteristics. Utilize dangerous items at the right time to perform effective kills. The better you know their routine, the better you can prepare extreme death traps.<br/><br/><ul><strong>\u25cf  Reactive A</strong>I</ul>Victims will hang around spots they like and will change their actions and behavior when something happens to them, such as seeing death.<br/><br/><ul><strong>\u25cf  A Morbid Sense of Humor</strong></ul>From suburbia to missile bases, there\u2019s always a wacky way to cause destruction.
