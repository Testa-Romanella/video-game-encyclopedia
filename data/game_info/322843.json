It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke.\u00a0<br/><br/>The amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most.\u00a0<br/>-There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings.<br/>-You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine<br/>-There is a band and a small secret lair<br/>-There is no beginning or end<br/>-There is no winning or losing<br/><br/>And there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction:\u00a0<br/><br/>Hit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they\u2019re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They\u2019re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up.\u00a0<br/><br/>To see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things.\u00a0<br/>If you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well.\u00a0<br/><br/>Before you download, I encourage you to download the 100+ page manual which I am giving away for free.

If you\u2019re looking for some fun, addicting type game with slick mechanics do not download this.<br/>-Play in single player mode, start a server or join a server. LAN works but usually from the .exe directly rather than from the app inside Steam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:44:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55c/55ca10f7a473cc271acb8981bf87a5e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeremycouillard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
