And tonight, the town that experienced a massacre under the Blood Eclipse centuries ago will not be letting its guests go without teaching them that lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's a zombies vs humans scenario. Up to 6 players can play at a time, with up to 4 human heroes, and 2 zombie players. Each player will choose the character they'd like to play as and join or create a match! <br/>\r\nYou start in an abandoned creepy house in the middle of a ghost town surrounded by forest. Once in, the humans will have a limited amount of time to search for weapons and items and try to complete the scenario objective. <br/>\r\nThe zombies just need to prevent that from happening, by doing the thing they do best, eating humans (don't worry you'll have AI zombies helping you too).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough an internet connection is technically not required, as you can play just against AI zombies, the game is significantly more fun if you're playing with a few humans :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/017/0176efedc8eb091e899711d62de2caf6.jpg", "website": "https://www.onlyhumanstudios.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Only Human Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Only Human Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
