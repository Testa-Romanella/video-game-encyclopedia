You're running low on resources, and you don't have enough power to get all the way home.

If I had more time I would definitely looking into addressing the load-time issue, and make a more efficient method of restarting the game/dying but I was on a time crunch. I started at 2:00 pm on Saturday so all in all it took 55 hours from start to finish. The only things that are not mine are some of the particle textures, the skybox and the music, which was made by god-among-men Kevin Macleod of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programs Used:<br/>-Unity<br/>-Blender<br/>-Inkscape<br/>-Asset Forge<br/>-Bosca Ceoil</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fda/fda5134d122d84531873108c696a8afb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["willgraygames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
