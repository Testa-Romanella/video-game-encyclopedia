In the meantime, please enjoy and let us know what you think!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:51:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9aee10db0d26940f3b436bc93a7fa7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CGBilz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
