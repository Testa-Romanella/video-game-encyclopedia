The theme of the jam was \"It is not real\" and I think I managed to make a game with a pretty cool concept around that. The game is a resource-management game where you are in a campsite trying to gather wood to keep your fire going, and food to keep you alive, while running from wolves from your imagination. You know the wolves aren't actually real, but your character sure doesn't. You'll have to learn how to keep your fire alive while keeping your sanity meter high to get a high score in this game.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>Arrow Keys </strong>to Move</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> to Interact</p>\n\n<p>Also, this is my first game I have ever posted online, so feedback on anything would be great!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T10:04:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa503d09c260bff86d9cbe466418617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cryob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
