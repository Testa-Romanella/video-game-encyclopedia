{"id": 576410, "slug": "towards-the-sky-2", "name": "Towards the Sky", "name_original": "Towards the Sky", "description": "<strong>Towards the Sky</strong> is a relaxing and minimalistic 3D platformer that\u2019s all about reaching the top of the level.  You jump from platform to platform while collecting coloured orbs with different bonusses and effects. Yellow orbs give you a speedboost, green ones allow you to double jump, and red ones launch you into the air. It's up to you as the player how you will get through the level, as there is no wrong way to do it.<h3>Now there are many platformers out there. What makes Towards the sky different?</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>Random level generator:</strong> Every level is randomly generated, with the player defining how tall they want the level to be, and difficulty deciding how many platforms spawn. This ensures that no level will truly be the same, allowing for an almost endless amount of gameplay. <br/></li><li><strong>Gamemodes for everyone:</strong> The default experience, while fun, doesn\u2019t suit everyone. If you like to live dangerously, there is the <strong>\u201dRandom Mode\u201d</strong> gamemode, which replaces all orbs with a white one that gives you a random effect every time you pick it up. There\u2019s also the <strong>\u201dLaunch Mode\u201d</strong> which only spawns red orbs, allowing you to peacefully fly from platform to platform without having to worry about doublejumps or speedboosts.<br/></li><li><strong>Laid back or competitive:</strong> Towards the Sky was made with relaxation in mind. To that effect, I have added the <strong>\u201dZen\u201d</strong> UI option, which disables anything except for the ingame menu. If you have more of a competitive spirit however, fret not! There\u2019s also the <strong>\"Speedrun\"</strong> UI option that adds a timer to the UI, so you can record speedruns or compete against your friends, to see who\u2019s truly the fastest among you. <br/></li><li><strong>Minimalistic design:</strong> I\u2019m a developer, not an artist. So I went with a minimalist, colourful design that everyone can enjoy, while still allowing the player to immerse themselves in the gameplay.<br/></li><li> <strong>Sound-free experience:</strong> Nothing is worse than an annoying item pick-up sound, or poorly curated music. Towards the Sky features no audio of any kind, allowing you to play with your own choice of music, or while chatting to friends without missing what\u2019s being said.</li></ul><br/>The game isn't perfect. And I am working hard to try and improve it when I can. To that effect, I am working closely with playtesters and streamers to fix bugs as they appear, improve performance, and add more fun gamemodes and mechanics. I am only one person, but I really believe Towards the Sky has potential, and am devoting all of my free time to it. No game can survive without its community, and I am thankful for everyone's help. Without it, Towards the Sky wouldn't have made its way onto Steam.<br/><br/>If you're still reading this, thank you for checking out Towards the Sky. Even if you aren't planning on buying the game, I still appreciate you taking the time to read through this. If you are planning on buying the game, I hope you have as great a time playing it, as I have had developing it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T03:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408e9baf97f6c2da64605090751c0bd4.jpg", "website": "http://unuslupus.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unus Lupus"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Unus Lupus"], "esrb_rating": null}
