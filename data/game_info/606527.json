Fly around as a dragon and just have fun with it!</p>\n<p>This project was originally intended as a school project, but I've decided to expand upon it. I hope to add more movement modes (e.g. climbing, swimming) among many other things (e.g. combat, better UI, better onboarding), so stay tuned for more updates!</p>\n<p>This project was made in UE4, and all current 3D assets are from the UE4 store. But for the most part, this was my work.</p>\n<p>Check out some music that I'm making for the game!\u00a0https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Alqo_FqEXimQpQHkFgzV-wuLTrfRQ0Wb?usp=sha...</p>\n<p>Feedback is absolutely appreciated.
