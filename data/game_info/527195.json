Theme: Pathetic Creature</p>\n<p>Less of a full thrilling game and more a proof of concept. There were many more ideas I didn't get time to implement but it is (hopefully) a playable game.\u00a0 Best played with mouse and keyboard, music sounds better with headphones and art looks best with your eyes closed.</p>\n<p>Music was written by me, and arranged by my mum (thanks mum)<br/>All the rest was just me!</p>\n<p>I appreciate all feedback and ideas! Thanks for playing!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T10:07:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ab/2ab57f99953cb128660c6e684b215d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yozoraki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
