It is intended for VR. I'm not sure how it'll work with Vive.</p>\n<p>Objective: You are a bird. You and your rival are competing for the affection of the yellow bird. You need to gather items around your area and bring them back to your nest. The bird with the best items in its nest is the most desirable. The yellow bird will not notice you unless you start to dance. You win if the yellow bird chooses your nest. Good Luck!</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Target Item:</p>\n<p>MotionController (L) FaceButton1 - Oculus X</p>\n<p>MotionController (R) FaceButton1 - Oculus A</p>\n<p>-Hold down Facebutton1 and use motion controllers to target items. Targets will light up if they are selectable. Release Facebutton1 and your bird will pick up the item. Once holding the item, target your nest and bring the item back. Items are worth different points depending on their type. When your nest contains enough items to attract the yellow bird, the dance button becomes enabled. You must dance for long enough to attract the yellow bird to win. It is not instantaneous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-You can target the rival bird's nest to steal items from it. The rival bird will attack you if you're too close to its nest. The rival bird will also attempt to steal items from your nest.</p>\n<p>-You can target the rival bird to attack it.</p>\n<p>Dance (Once you've collected enough items)</p>\n<p>MotionController (L) FaceButton2 - Oculus Y</p>\n<p>MotionController (R) FaceButton2 - Oculus B</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:15:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06b/06b92f99c0a5d29dac10214c944474e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["muaddib505"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
