My idea was to try a few things related to dice games and the theme of the jam forced me to do this.\u00a0\u00a0Good thing is that I had never worked with vehicles so this was fun to learn.\u00a0I also tried a new workflow and architecture in Unity which made me really happy how it ended up working.\u00a0 Fun jam overall.</p>\n<p>Sorry there is no AI, I started working on it. But I decided to leave it for a future iteration so I would have time to get it right. For now enjoy this practice mode.</p>\r\nThanks to\r\n<ul><li>@KenneyNL\u00a0for his lovely art. I keep defaulting to it on every jam (https://kenney.nl)</li><li>The jam organizers for the inspiration.</li><li>@Peche for the help in finding the lost scriptable object. xD</li></ul>\r\nGame Controls\r\n<p>You can play with the dice as it was my original idea. You can roll your dices every turn and select which ones you want to apply to either your steering wheel or your accelerator. Then you hit drive and the car responds for a few seconds to your input.</p>\n<p>For this you just need to click the corresponding buttons to Roll, Drive and the arrows to assign the dices on the top of the screen.</p>\r\nTest Controls\r\n<p>I\u00a0also left my test controls because I wanted to allow people to test the idea beyond using dice.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Arrows Up/Down - Modify\u00a0accelerator</li><li>Arrows Left/Right - Modify steering wheel</li><li>Space - Execute turn</li><li>F - Flip your car back to normal\u00a0(just in case)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40de302f7ef1ff9bf33cb8c84695a875.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jlreymendez"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
