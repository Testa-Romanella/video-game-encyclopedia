Fortunately, the Devil is kind enough to provide you with a 'phantom mode', allowing you to become untouched while it's on. Not only that, but you can destroy any ghosts you touch while in this mode.</p>\n<p>However, there's a price. While phantom mode is active, you also slowly lose health. It's a good strategy to pick and choose when you enter phantom mode, as there will likely be times where you get cornered and will need to escape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You can also chat with the Devil before each wave. Whether it's listening to him have no faith in you, or possibly trying to bargain, there's a nice variety of content.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game! It's short, but I'm proud of it. Oh yeah, and Happy Halloween everyone!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T04:40:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/096/096dca358f6266bd1dabc88fbbcaf76d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["stephen-berry"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
