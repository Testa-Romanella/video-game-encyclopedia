They made games on those for us already ancient computers. Now you have a chance. To play an ancient game in the ancient theme. <br/><br/>Five Days is a text-based game where you build your own small village. <br/>Each day new opportunities arise. Research, build and in the end, FIGHT! <br/><br/>This game was originally made for compo from scratch but I started too late and wasn't able to finish it on time. Even tho I'm posting this on the last second. I would be glad if you could report me some bugs and feel free to post anything into the comments :). <br/><br/>Key game feautures: <br/>Building, <br/>Researching, <br/>Days, <br/>Simple combat with a simple story, <br/>Resources, <br/>and most importantly ... writing! <br/><br/>Hope you all enjoy this game. I put a lot of effort into it and it's not really completed yet. <br/><br/>Balancing is a huge issue since the game has a small \"economy\". And the balance is definetly not good at this point. Will improve later. <br/><br/>Thanks :D <br/><br/>( Game requires Java to be installed on your system. ) </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a4/9a4cf34a82c7784bec286fb62238a4f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DUDSS"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
