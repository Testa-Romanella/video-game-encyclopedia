You will control a pair of brother and sister who strayed from their father because of a war. <br/>On the dangerous warfield, there is no mercy. They don't have power to fight, so you only can rely on Clency's detection of elements that can make you see the enemys' next motion. Use your Intelligence to help Clency and Livia make through these difficulties.<br/><br/><br/>Besides, they have different tallents that you can use: Clency can push the character or obstacle away; Livia can cast a magic bubble to move object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The only thing what they can do  is supporting each others. But after the war, is there still any hope in front of them, or it is just a bigger tragedy?<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T06:01:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01fdb170b62ff2bed4ff7173ed09e48.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/gaming/LuluBearStudio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lulu Bear Studio \u9b6f\u9b6f\u718a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4", "Lulu Bear Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Lulu Bear Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
