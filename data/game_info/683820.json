The chicks will keep following their mother as long as they are inside her circle. <br/><br/>Prolonged distance between the kids will cause them to RESET back to their original position. <br/><br/>The mother hen can give commands to her chicks while in close proximity with them. But only one command can be issued at the cost of a RESET after its execution. <br/><br/>Getting all the chicks to the flag will advance to the next level. <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>WASD - Move the hen. <br/>Shift - Sprint <br/>Right Mouse - Lock any chicks within the circle in place. <br/>Right Mouse + Left Mouse - Command them to move to any location within the map.[Caution tends to be buggy. Always try to click on the ground itself instead of on any objects.]</p><p>Made for BYOG2021 following the theme \"Reset\".</p><p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T06:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e44f84cd5f5bde3d0445ec7c83a18032.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sh4nks0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
