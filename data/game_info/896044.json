If you've come across this, that means you probably know me in real life! This is the game I made for my game design class in my last semester of college. It's nothing much - just two short levels - but I wanted to be able to share my work with anyone who wanted to see it! Thanks for checking it out and I hope you enjoy it, even if it's just a silly little skeleton platformer. I'm not a game designer, so just keep that in mind. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Move: W, A, S, D\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump: Space Bar</p>\n<p>Shoot: Left Mouse Button</p>\n<p>Teleport: T</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T18:30:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/908/90886731091a59fed5ec1e57ac2e9369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ashtynkelley"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
