In the game itself, there is a \"Start\" button to spawn into the world, but to leave the game, you'll need to manually exit the window, or use the standard Windows shortcuts ALT+F4 or CTRL+W. </strong><br/></p><ul><li><strong><em>Controls:</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>A , D - Yaw</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>W, S - Pitch</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Q, E - Roll</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Space - Stop Thrusters (Brake)</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Shift - Boost</em></strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ff1c90a9e07aa3680dc2192ba57d1b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beanco Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
