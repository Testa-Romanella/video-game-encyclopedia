This is an old project I worked on for some time it still lacks a lot of polish and has some issues but it is in a very playable state.\u00a0Your goal is to kill all your opponents by destroying them with items or sending them off the cliffs of the map.\u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>This game revolves around a dashing mechanic similar to the shield of Cthulhu in Terraria double tap left or right\u00a0or double swing your stick left or right to dash. This will propel your character in that direction sending anyone you hit flying. Smashing is your other ability pressing the smash button will lock your character in place making them vulnerable to dashes. Once it finishes charging your character will be launched toward the ground killing anybody you hit and launching anyone near you away when\u00a0you land.\u00a0 You can double jump by pressing jump again when off the ground. Your jump and dash are recharged by touching the ground.\u00a0You can pick up and use items you find with the use button and drop them with the drop button.\u00a0</p>\r\nUI\r\n<p>Your player's UI will have several boxes the same color as your player representing their lives. The large bar denotes the availability of your smash. The box next to the large bar denotes your dash availability.</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nKEYBOARD 1\u00a023\u00a04CONTROLLERMOVEW\u00a0A S DI J K LT F G H5 1 2 3JOYSTICKDASHDouble Tap A/DDouble Tap F/HDouble Tap F/HDouble Tap 1/3Double Swing Stick Left/RightSMASHLEFT SHIFTNC0Right Bumper ButtonUSEEOY6X / Square / Right TriggerDROPQUR4B / Circle / Right Trigger", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/5575e33b5f8632e9627250f4bc99b147.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeafesMan"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
