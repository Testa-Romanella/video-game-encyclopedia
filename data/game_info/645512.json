I was inspired to make this game by many old platform games like Contra , Mario Adventure of Island . There are various types of monsters, animals, and human enemies . Each with a different way of attacking . There are many traps, some easy and some hard to dodge. Levels are designed so that the player would face challenges each time he goes further . Level Designing is inspired by Mario and Prince of Persia to challenge the players. difficulty rises the further the player goes .There are a total 5 levels till now .
