Close to crossing a portal for a calmer world, its soul escapes from its body.\u00a0</strong></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>We wanted to make a game similar to a poem : a simple and evasive story, but yet beautiful. We also wanted to infuse the gameplay with trial and persistence through the notion of the Way of the Cross . In terms of graphism, we wanted to have a horrific but yet beautiful environment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To suit our intention, we thought about the artist <em>Zislaw Beksinski.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Beksinski was a polish painter who pictured surrealist painting of his dreams, with recurrent themes of war, catholic repression and loneliness, depicted in surrealist landscape, morbid but yet beautiful. And also a bunch of humanoid creatures.\u00a0 His style is recognisable by the recurrence of organic patterns and flesh matters. All of these make us chose Beksinski as our main artistic direction, as it suited our attentions. We tried our best to fill our game with the same feelings as his paintings.\r\n</p>\n<p>The team :</p>\n<p>Hincourt (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/echinopsps\u00a0)\u00a0<br/>Steven Favre (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/lioniks\u00a0)\u00a0<br/>Tom G\u00e2tineau (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/tomgatineau\u00a0)<br/>Alhynae (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/alhynae\u00a0)<br/>Mah\u00e9 (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/maheaheo\u00a0)<br/>Lalie Picot (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/lalie_picot\u00a0)<br/>Nolwenn Rouget (\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/nol_wenn\u00a0)<br/>Me\u00a0\ud83d\udc4b ( https://www.artstation.com/laura_moget\u00a0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T09:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d65/d6509f11c85ee9996a177a38252bf08b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laura Moget"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
