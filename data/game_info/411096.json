These two have been friends since they were small. \r\n  </p>\n<p>On one faithful evening the duo went into the woods to find one last ingredient for a potion, the blooming Tulip, a rare and exotic flower that only grew on specific years. They wandered deep into the mystical forest and within a matter of a few days they found their prize. A beautiful tulip right beside an old tree. Kiba went ahead to pick the flower for Bella, but at the instant he kneeled he felt a pulling force drawing him closer to the tree. With one fell swoop he was consumed by a hole under the tree. Bella in despair ran to the hole, shouting on the top of her lungs \u201cKIBA, KIBA ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\u201d her shouts echoed in the hole, As soon as she tried to move, the force pulled her down into the hole as well.\r\n  </p>\n<p>She spiraled all the way down with visions of horrors. * Kiba getting possessed*\r\n  </p>\n<p>With a loud thud echoing into the valley of nothingness she woke up, looking around, not knowing how she got there and where she was. In front of her was what looked like Kiba but much larger. \u201cKiba\u2026 is that you\u201d \r\n  </p>\n<p>The monster turned around, looking at her with a look of hunger and devastation, and with a loud roar Belle began to run. She tried using her spells to stop beast in its steps, but at no avail. She was nullified. Void of magic. She ran without looking back, but the beasts voice echoed through the valley. \u201cRUN BUNNY, RUN.
