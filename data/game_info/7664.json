Pretty much the freshest tower defense  strategy game I have played in ages. <br/>The more I play it, the more I love it. I don't think I've ever been this challenged by a tower defense game before. If tower defence or strategy games are your thing, then you REALLY need to try this out. It's seriously amazing.\" <br/>Touch Arcade Forum Review<br/><br/>Description<br/>Have you got what it takes to keep your cool and win?<br/>You take on the role of the Android Commander to lead your forces back from the brink of extinction and inflict the ultimate revenge on those who put you there. Test your strategic knowledge as you strive to complete primary and secondary objectives whilst building a successful defense against the enemy waves of attack. A strategic, story driven, tower defense game with boss fights that builds tension, and puts you under pressure to prove you have got what it takes to win ... have you? <br/><br/>What people are saying:<br/><br/>App Store Review \u2013 Lite Version<br/>\u201cEpic story driven tower defense with boss fights! I really enjoyed this game, nice graphics and an interesting story that keeps the momentum building, accompanied by some great music. The word strategy in the name is apt with defense placement and resource management being key to success.  I especially like the levelling system and upgrade options. Great game, highly recommended\u201d<br/><br/>Touch Arcade Forum:<br/>\u201cGreat game. I can take or leave some tower defense games, just holding off wave after wave, but I found Strategic Defence really spiced things up a little with primary and secondary objectives. I found it taking me back to my younger days of playing games like Command and Conquer\u201d<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s also nice to have an underlying story and theme which evolves throughout the game. I like games that have a story, it makes me want to play through to the end. All in all I would definitely recommend this TD game.\u201d<br/>\u201cThis is a really good game.
