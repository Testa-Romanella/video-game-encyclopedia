Talk to island inhabitants, relax on the beach, find all the secrets the island has to offer.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>[WASD] to Move<br/>[SPACEBAR] to Jump</p>\n<p>[Escape] Pause menu<br/></p>\n<p><strong>---</strong><br/><strong>Development Notes:</strong><br/>This is my entry for LSD Jam 21. Inspired by the atmosphere of LSD Dream Emulator as well as trips taken around California and the western U.S. The writing in the game is generated randomly, written via a cut-up technique or transcribed directly from dreams to the best of my ability.<br/></p>\n<p>I may update this project with new content/fixes.\u00a0Due to time and other constraints there's a lot I didn't get to include,\u00a0particularly a number of\u00a0scripted dream sequences. Instead I focused on building\u00a0distinct areas for the island.\u00a0In the future\u00a0I'd like to\u00a0create a tighter, more\u00a0narratively focused experience using some of these assets or concepts. I had a lot of fun making it and following the progress of other developers, I hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:51:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d9/8d9fbe4df6bf98de6644c739014e9449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Potterfield"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
