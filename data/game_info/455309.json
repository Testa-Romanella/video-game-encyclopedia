This is an old version dating from roughly 2015-ish that I found in my hard drive this morning and decided to upload it in hopes that maybe someone will like it and I'll finally continue developing my game!</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some screenshots of this prototype VS the current version in development<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Prototype<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Current<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Alot of things including monsters and music were removed due lost information and credits to their creators. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Added content that I can trace however belongs to the following:</strong><br/>Mack Sprites (edited by me) and Mack tilesets<br/>Germania tileset<br/>Futuristic tileset<br/>Icedragon SciFi<br/>Luna X\u00a0 DS X Germania<br/>Fishing game no longer present in this version by Galv's-scripts<br/></p>\n<p>(If you recognize any other non-RPGmaker content in game, please let me know so those creators can be properly credited) <br/><br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot of dialogue in this as it was scrapped pretty early, but I thought maybe someone would be interested in exploring the maps a bit, and getting a feel of the beginning story to Raxis Saga. Alot of typical RTP npcs were added with the intention of being replaced eventually with Mack Size sprites. However one party member can be seen in the second village who is the same size as the player. <br/></p>\n<p>The current version of the game is in early development but it going VERY slow as I am attempting to make all the sprites in the game. I am hoping to release it in episodic format (at cheap prices of course) . I am also thinking of removing battles entirely to focus on the story a bit more with puzzle/mystery solving.\u00a0 If theres enough interest in my project, I may possibly make a twitter account for updates.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>And finally the story:</strong></p>\n<p>Raxis Saga begins with\u00a0 a unamed\u00a0human female who seems to be captured by a strange species. They want a treasure called the void crystal, but ??? has never heard of it, so she is forcefully put under a strange experiment with unknown results. Escaping through a portal with the help of an unseen person, she manages to find herself in a strange new world inhabited by non-human beings. <br/></p>\n<p>(As I wasn't able to make monster girls and such with rpg maker creators, everyone looks like humans instead)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:52:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e96508ecf0985a2e9d210c0964a6238c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sim"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
