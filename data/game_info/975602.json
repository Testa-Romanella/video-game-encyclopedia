{"id": 975602, "slug": "cubecuberubik", "name": "CubeCubeRubik", "name_original": "CubeCubeRubik", "description": "The Rubik's Cube is a classic toy with a long history. It is simple to play. You only need to slide and rotate the cube to align the colors on all sides. CubeCubeRubik is a casual Rubik's Cube game, intended to restore the classic Rubik's Cube gameplay on the computer.<br/>\r\nThe game supports keyboard, mouse or gamepad controller.<br/>\r\nSecond-level, third-level, and fourth-level Rubik's Cubes have been added to the game. A standard three-level Rubik's Cube has 43 trillion transformation possibilities. You can try to race against time and try to complete the Rubik's Cube challenge in the shortest time, or try to complete the challenge in the minimum number of steps through rigorous logical analysis.<br/>\r\nThere is also a blind twisting challenge mode in the game. You will try to complete the restoration of each level of the Rubik's Cube with a limited number of viewing opportunities, challenging your memory and logic ability.<br/>\r\nIf you are interested in the Rubik's Cube, want to challenge the limits of your speed or logic, or want your children to learn about the Rubik's Cube, a classic and interesting toy, you might as well give it a try.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSince this was my first time trying to make a game, it was fun and challenging for me to do all the design, art, and coding work and ship the game by myself. Because of this, there may be a lot of shortcomings in the game, so any feedback, impressions or constructive criticism from you is greatly appreciated. Or if you have other fantastic ideas about the Rubik's Cube game, you are welcome to communicate with me to discuss the feasibility of implementation. Thank you~!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T05:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6e/a6e9efb47388ba36557792a3ce95a834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iceblue Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["iceblue Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
