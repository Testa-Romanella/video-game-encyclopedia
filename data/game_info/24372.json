The wild and far West! Come and see the fastest \n      cowboy in action; you will visit a typical western town, with its grand \n      saloon, its sheriff office, and its bank. Here you will meet the classic \n      doctor, the powerful \u201cmaster of the land\u201d, an industrious pioneer, and \n      men and women who, with their blood, their sweat, and their tears, \n      raised a great nation.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      But there are things that cannot be helped, and one of them, very \n      typical in the West, is the continuous fights between farmers and cattle \n      ranchers. And if farmers used to win the sympathy of most people, the \n      truth is that cattle ranchers always had victory in their hands. They \n      had more money and more men; they were very powerful and very strong. \n      Only a cowboy as peculiar as Fenimore Fillmore could side with the \n      farmers when the rest of the cowboys were paid by the cattle rancher, \n      the most merciless and sinister of characters in the game.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/449/449d3f2f365b5b4923287770a037cd16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Revistronic"], "esrb_rating": null}
