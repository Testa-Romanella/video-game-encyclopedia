The theme was \"Duality\".</p>\n<p>Use left/right arrows or A/D keys\u00a0in your keyboard to rotate the ball.</p>\n<p>The goal is to maximize the number of bounces. If the ball collides with a square with the same color, one bounce is incremented. Otherwise, the square is removed. You lose when the ball moves below or above the limits of the board.</p>\n<p>Credits: Francisco Moyano and Sergio Dominguez.
