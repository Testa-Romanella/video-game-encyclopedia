Seriously, don't even attempt to play this in Safari, it will look like ass and the audio probably won't work properly. Don't be a Safari. </p>DescriptionDear Chancellor is like, a totally highbrow critique of late capitalism. You wouldn't understand.<p>Made with Construct 2 in a couple of hours. This was somewhat of a last-minute project as I had other obligations and I lost like half a day of work to a system freeze. Because I didn't do an initial save of the project then, C2's autosave function didn't do its job. So yeah, fun times. I feel like I could have done a lot more with this idea, but there you go. Might do a post-jam version, I dunno. We'll see. </p>Credits<p>Music CC-BY-SA by Jake Cataford<br/></p><p>Laser Sound and Mega Horn from freesound.org</p><p>Explosion Sprites from Adam Atomic's Abandonauts Set</p><p>Amazing Coin Sprites by Clint Bellanger under CC-BY-SA</p><p>Picture of Merkel wearing 3D glasses CC-BY-SA by Armin K\u00fcbelbeck</p><p>Picture of Merkel's Hands CC-BY-SA by Armin Linnartz</p><p>Menu screen gif from some movie via google image search, sue me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/464c2dba5347c7c22ad8de5119ca1c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ludonaut"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
