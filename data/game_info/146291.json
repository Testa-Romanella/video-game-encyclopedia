The full version will be available for purchase very soon here, starting with 50 levels and with more being added in updates over time. </p>\n<p>Feel free to donate, and any and all feedback is encouraged!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/9178f01d236c42f279a103d4427e3a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stoogebag"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
