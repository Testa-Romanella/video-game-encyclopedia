It isn't as simple as getting your block to the goal but you have to also keep in mind that your block must be 'hooked' at all times on to the platform\u00a0so that it doesn't fall through.\u00a0Try and complete the level in as few moves as possible.<br/><br/>It's ready for testing and would love any kind of feedback<br/><br/>I have 12 levels for testing so far and a further 8 completed. I have many level ideas which include an array of different enemies, bigger platforms, multi platforms etc but I will wait for testing feedback first</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>(Controls can be changed in the settings menu)<br/></p>\n<p>Rotate Left - <strong>A</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate Right - <strong>D</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate Up - <strong>W</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate Down - <strong>S</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate Anti-Clockwise - <strong>Q</strong></p>\n<p>Rotate Clockwise - <strong>E</strong></p>\n<p>Menu - <strong>M</strong></p>\n<p>Toggle Mode - <strong>TAB</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T08:31:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f1508848a3f04234be06d4a492a9160.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balcony Projects"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
