Upon entering its wretched walls you are trapped within, but where are you really? What is the true nature of the house that you find yourself in? Why do strange horrors lurk in the darkest corners of the house's expanse and--perhaps most importantly--why did you come here of your own free will?</p><p>(Made with Lazarus over three days for a Hallowe'en game jam.)</p><p><strong>WARNING: Contains scenes of a disturbing nature. Discretion is advised.<br/></strong></p><p><em>UPDATE 3: Removed a bug that makes an item in the first room after the Foyer inaccessible if you inspect another object in the area before obtaining it.</em><br/></p><p><em>UPDATE 2: Major spelling and grammar fix. Also changed some of the wording to better reflect my intent. This will hopefully be the last update for this game. (Also, removed ***OLD*** versions now that the game has been judged in the game jam it was made for.)<br/></em></p><p><em>UPDATE 1: Fixed a bug that locked the game up if you examined the final door too early in the game. Fixed a bug where a narrative section was missed out in the third room from the left.
