They decide to let you find them in order to see if you meet the requirements. They warn you about passing out from heat exposure and will call off the search if they see signs of overheating.</p>\n<p>The Car you\u2019ll use is an old Jeep the rangers use for supplies runs. It\u2019s a bit rusty but it\u2019s a great off-road vehicle and shouldn\u2019t have any problems except the AC doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019ll need to keep track of how long you\u2019re out in the sun for since the heat will start affecting your vision.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Letko</strong> - Programmer\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Evan Knebel</strong> - Programmer\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Patrick Boyd</strong> - Vehicle Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Brandon Gonzalez-Rivera</strong> \u2013 Character Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Jake Evans</strong> - Environment Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Colton Greer</strong> - Environment Artist\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Install</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Installation instructions:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Extract the files by right clicking the downloaded file and choosing extract here.
