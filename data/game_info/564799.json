The overwhelming majority of us want to be kinder to ourselves, but don't know where to start. Kinder World breaks down the concept of 'self-kindness' into something accessible by pairing houseplant care gameplay with evidence-based activities. We\u2019re using our experience as game developers in collaboration with psychologists like Harvard-based\u00a0Dr. Tara Cousineau, PhD, to create something evidence-backed, relaxing and accessible, helping us to be kind to ourselves and to others.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5da1d795576d6d9ec02f43c93c0aa9d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Lumi Interactive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
