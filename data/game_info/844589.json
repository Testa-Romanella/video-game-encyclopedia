The theme for this jam\u00a0was \"As Above, So Below.\" We used this theme throughout our game with references to Armageddon, the war between Heaven and Hell, but also because we used this jam to make our first ever top-down style game. Top-down was new but very fun to work with, and although we didn't have enough time to flesh out everything we wanted to do with the game,\u00a0we're glad about how things turned out. We hope you enjoy playing Armageddon Resurrection, have a great day!<br/><br/>Click and drag or click mouse to move, 1-5 to use Combo Abilities</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T06:52:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ce/9ce577554c841052992b9872f89a2fc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameJay2112"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
