Yours is a\u00a0small kingdom at the borders of the Roman Empire. Its fields are plentiful with strong grains, its hills overflowing with sweet wine.

As Roman troops and colonists start encroaching on your lands, the people look to you for guidance.\u00a0 You still\u00a0have some diplomatic influence over\u00a0the Roman commanders near you, but\u00a0the Emperor's absurd decrees and increasing demand for tribute can only lead to more conflict. At the end of the day, you are sure of only one thing: the Romans are coming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: left mouse button.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>My entry for the WASM4 Game Jam 2022.
