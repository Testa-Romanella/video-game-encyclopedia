{"id": 755048, "slug": "voxquest-the-firebird", "name": "Voxquest: The Firebird", "name_original": "Voxquest: The Firebird", "description": "An open world fantasy adventure in a voxel art style! Explore a massive, continuous overworld with puzzles, upgrades, a variety of weapon aspects and six dungeons. Play with keyboard or XBOX-style controller.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor centuries, the land of Rus has been defended by the mighty Firebird, who awakens to duel the great demon and drive away its darkness. But this time, as the darkness spreads, the Firebird is nowhere to be found, and the Gods have secluded themselves from man. You are Sveta, a young girl who sets out into the world to find the gods, to wake the Firebird and ultimately, to save the world she loves.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a retro adventure heavily, heavily influenced by the older Legend of Zelda games. You can roam the overworld as you please, gather weapons and powerups and take the dungeons in any order. It's a potent shot of nostalgia for those of us who cut our teeth on these games, and can never get enough.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T14:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/81488e1f5e052dd8e7fef2eaecb2ed1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lierinwait", "lierniwait"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Lierinwait Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
