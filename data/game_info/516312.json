The bouncing mechanic is not perfect and I couldn't get it to the level I would like but I hope you enjoy regardless.\u00a0I would love to hear your feedback, or if you have any ideas about the bouncing issue. Thanks :)</p>\n\n<p>Controls: basic fps controls</p>\n<p>wasd: movement</p>\n<p>left mouse click: fire projectile</p><p>Issue: Despite my best attempt to have a working HTML5 build there seem to be issues with the mouse controls and fullscreen settings. Therefore it's best to use the windows build.</p>\n<p>Assets used are:</p>\n<p>BGM:\u00a0Firefly Memories by Rewob (c) copyright 2020 Licensed under a Creative Commons Noncommercial Sampling Plus license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/rewob/62213\u00a0</p>\n<p>First person all in one by Aedan Graves:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/first-person-all-in...</p>\n<p>Forest Pack by FinderSai:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/forest-pack-5516/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T02:36:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4969587b8dc4ccc0d1402bcbb34331d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Verxus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
