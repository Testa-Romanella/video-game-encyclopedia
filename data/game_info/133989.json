Build a \"bridge\" of special cubes for to exit a location. The task is complicated by the fact that the number of cubes for construction is limited, so there is no room for error. The game has a variety of chips, such as \"dynamic cubes\" that you can move yourself and which obey the laws of physics. Sometimes you just build a road, at other times you\u0412'll put the cubes on the buttons that activate different mechanisms. A pleasant and relaxing style of music keeps you engaged, and the lack of a time limit allows you to carefully consider each decision. Features: - Multiplatform. The game looks equally good as personal computers as well as the iPhone and the iPad. - Fun puzzle game based on the spatial thinking. - Soothing music helps keep things interesting - No time limit, no rush!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01e20e5c8d54e3c4285785fa0a07e8c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["danil998333"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
