It is meant to be a first person shooter taking place in a world ravaged by post-nuclear winter where the player needs to stop a cult from destroying what's left of [generic US city].\u00a0Due to crunch, we could not include any menus in-game, so here's the controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Fire Weapon</strong> - Left-Click</li><li><strong>Zoom Weapon</strong> - Right-Click</li><li><strong>Switch Weapon</strong> - Scroll Wheel</li><li><strong>Walk </strong>- WASD Keys</li><li><strong>Look </strong>- Move Mouse</li><li><strong>Crouch/Slide</strong> - Left-Ctrl</li></ul>\n<p>WARNING: Shift+Alt+W closes the current window in Chrome, so it is recommended to download if you wish to test out sliding and such.<br/><br/>Some gameplay elements to be implemented in future releases are stagger, different damage types, another enemy type, unique bosses, grenades, and equipment.\u00a0Please provide feedback and ask any questions about the project!
