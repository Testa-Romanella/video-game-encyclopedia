Beautiful graphics with antidepressant bright colors!</li><li>12 fantasy missions in single player campaign.</li><li>Multiplayer skirmishes offline and online, casual or with global leaderboard.</li><li>10+ unit types with crazy skills.</li></ul>\n<p>Exorder\u2019s got looks and smarts! Under the layer of colorful graphics lies a cleverly designed tactics system. The game is a solid entry into the turn-based tactics genre that focus on fun and easy to pick up combat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Single-player campaign consists of 12 missions linked by a fantasy-style story about three neighbouring countries and a game of the throne after the deceased king. This mode gets you acquainted with skills needed to successfully command a roster of Exorder's quirky units.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Multiplayer Mode you can choose between online matchmaking and casual skirmish. Fight against randomly selected players of a similar skill level. Defeat your enemy to climb up global leaderboard! Or casually create a custom multiplayer game for up to 4 players, either offline or online.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The purpose of Exorder is to provide a solid entry in the underrepresented genre of turn-based tactics games that focus on fun and easy to pick up combat. The game is being developed with a team of three (the entirety of Solid9 Studio) and we do our best to provide you - the player - with the best gaming experience possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/570/57091b13ee2a9a239df0866f1002c451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fat Dog Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
