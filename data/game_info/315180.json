We had the usual crew around for this plus a little extra but this time we have a group logo! We're still trying to stick to genres we haven't done or tried yet. This one sort of threw us for a loop as we had a harder time coming up with an idea that we thought would be too close to our last. However in the end the roguelike style we went with ended up feeling like a much different game.</p>\n<p>As usual we had a lot of fun coming up with Craigs next adventure and what new characters he'll interact with next. We hope you enjoy! And if you can't get enough of Craig we made 6 other games with him in it! Go check it out.</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>[Logan Marks] - Programming (Enemies, Bosses, Map, Effects), Sprites/Animations (Enemies), Sound effects/filters, Voice (drifter)</p>\n<p>[Amanda Gallant] - Sprites (Enemies, Bosses), Slide Art, Voice (Killjane)</p>\n<p>[Brodie Beaman] - Programming (Powerups, HUD, UI Elements), Sprites (UI) Sound Editing\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Chad Gerein] - Programming (Enemies, Parallax, Bosses)</p>\n<p>[Mitchell Maclean - Programming (Player, Powerups, Bosses), Voice (Jingle), Humor Consultant, Game Design</p>\n<p>[Brenden Roach] - Story Board, Slide Art, Humor Consultant, Voice(Fossil Fuel)</p>\n<p>[Taylor Seely] - Sound Finder, Story Board</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a8dee410539edef59f9c6210fac1271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Logicon211"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
