The player controls several parties of four characters each, and commands different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic side view, such as often used in Japanese-style RPGs. The outcome of some battles can also be affected by other tactical decisions, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire to prevent enemies from coming through it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-13T04:19:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba6dc02961f02c32f8b13cf7b621b187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 5, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Square"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Square"], "esrb_rating": null}
