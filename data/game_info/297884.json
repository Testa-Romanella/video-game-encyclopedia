The main focus is to discover and explore abstract installations and areas of intense light and sound. Inspired by psychology and light experiments as well as early video art from the 1970s, Luminous Flux is an anti-game that challenges the traditional rules of the computer game world.</p>\n<p>Luminous Flux, explore mode, contains five themes and over 50 installations. Most of the installations are easily accessed, but some are hidden and require solving a puzzle or finding a specific item to open. Each theme has short-cuts to the main menu were you can jump between the different themes. You can also move through the game using doors, portals and elevators. If you are lost follow the arrows, signs, or press the K\u2013 button on the keyboard or the Start \u2013 button in the middle of the controller to change position or restart the game.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong><br/>- Explore 5 different themes<br/>- Discover over 50 installations<br/>- Find hidden art works<br/>- Solve the main puzzle to find the exit</p>\n<p>In photometry, luminous flux is the measure of the perceived power of light. One lumen is defined as the luminous flux of light produced by a light source that emits one candela of luminous intensity over a solid angle of one steradian.<br/></p>\n<p>The game designer, Christian B\u00f8en (born 1978), works with interactive art and draws impulses from computer games, art history and natural science. He often mixes self-composed audio and music with the visual and has released six albums in electronic music.</p>\n<p>More information about his work on www.christianboen.no and www.surrealist.no</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>An art game by Christian B\u00f8en<br/>Music by Termodress<br/>Beta and test player Ludwig B\u00f8en-Zahl</p>\n<p><strong>Royalty free and creative common assets,\u00a03D models, audio, materials and textures by various artists at:</strong><br/>www.unrealengine.com/marketplace<br/>www.turbosquid.com<br/>3dwarehouse.sketchup.com<br/>www.freesound.org<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Also thanks to:</strong><br/>Wikipedia<br/>Unreal Engine 4 Team<br/><br/><strong>WARNING</strong><br/></p>\n<p>THIS ART GAME CONTAINS STROBE LIGHT EFFECTS AND HIGH FREQUENCY SOUNDS WHICH MAY AFFECT VIEWERS WITH PHOTO-SENSITIVE EPILEPSY OR OTHER SUCH CONDITIONS.
