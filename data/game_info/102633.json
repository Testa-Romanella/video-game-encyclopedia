It is a parody of a near future FPS game (or Call of Duty as of BO2). It sucks, I know. I couldn't get it done. Consider this a pre-alpha demo for a game that will never be finished. Textures from CGtextures. Models made by me. Please don't rate so horribly, I know it sucks. At least rate this for self awarness!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae1dac5e610daab45dfba03a63997ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Crawler Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
