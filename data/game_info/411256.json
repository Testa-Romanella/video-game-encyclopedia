With this game my hope is that when younger kids play it they will realize that PEOPLE create games by making decisions and being creative. I'm planning on using this game as a way to spark conversation with kids in the classroom and ultimately inspire those with an interest in video games. Shout out to my teacher friend Mr.\u00a0Dilly - who helped me with phrasing things in such a way that 1st graders would understand them. Making this game was really fun. I created all of the art, sounds, music, code, and even voice over. It was fun to explore player choice- something that I will continue to do. (Hey, this probably isn't the final version of this...) I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T03:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/724ec15d50115477b80292b7578dc3ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brad Kraeling"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
