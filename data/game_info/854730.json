{"id": 854730, "slug": "connexion", "name": "Connexion", "name_original": "Connexion", "description": "<p>Connexion is an audiovisual music performance for VR. The performer uses 3D interface to control the granular synthesis and spatial positioning of sounds within the auditorium. The visual representation gives the performer clues about the characteristics of sound, also being an indicator of the spatial propagation of sound. This gives the performer an actual feeling of performing with their gestures and movements as one has with the material instruments. The form of the interface itself is digital artwork.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Connexion was created using Unreal Engine 4. It employs granular synthesis as the modulator of the pre-composed music. The performer moves the sounds with his hands (which are the emitters of sounds) around the round object, which is called a \u201emonad\u201d. The movement makes the sound flow around the soundfield. The position of hands also changes the parameters of the synthesis \u2013 sound emission time and granularity. This gives control over dramatic aspects of music piece.<br/></p>\n<p>Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 11 64-bit</p>\n<p>Supported headsets: HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, Oculus Quest via cable link, Valve Index</p>\n<p>Room size requirements : minimal required is 2 meters by 2 meters</p>\n<p>Shortcuts:<br/></p>\n<p>SPACE - start the experience</p>\n<p>R - restart experience</p>\n<p>P - pause</p>\n<p>C - re-center</p>\n<p>ESC - exit the application</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac9/ac9529441dbbf80685bf4d14121da7c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["INEXSISTENS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
