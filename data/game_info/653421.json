Being occupied by an evil federation known as the VOLTEGA forces; among a remote planet in the galaxy, he is brought into captivity with his squadron and the woman he loved and tortured into submission with them. Eventually, the enemy turns him from a cyborg, into a full-bodied cyber soldier, only...they forgot the Volteka grade AI chip, and left what was known as the \"Power Glove\" too damn close.</p>\n<p><strong>Play the Classic Fury-Driven Cyber-Lover:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Escaping in fury, desperation and pure vengeance; he's after three things: the VOLTEGA forces blown to smithereens, his friends rescued and his cyber-girl back.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Run Through Eternity, and Out of Space:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>It's an endless, randomly generated 3D \"runner\" where you are \"running out of space\" when two ray shields are put between you and a never ending space-labyrinth of hazards, obstacles and cyber enemies...in one of the largest VOLTEGA space compounds known as <em>Eternity</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>Controls, key-bindings and so on are listed in the game's options menu, accessible through the main menus and pause menus in game (Esc / P or Right Special on Gamepad). It is singleplayer, and loading screens with hints are also available in game for convenience. Mouse Wheel Up / Down toggles the player's combat state currently, so it would switch between unarmed / and the glove for now (this is also planned to be added as a key binding when Axis mappings are added).<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>What to Expect after the Jam Submissions have been Judged:</strong>\n</em></p>\n<p>LOTS and LOTS of updates, I had so much fun with this project in fact in the short time I had, that I actually really want to improve upon the concept and maybe even push it out to Steam once it's polished and depending on what players would like utmost.</p>\n<p><em>After the jam, what will be added / implemented immediately are but not limited to the following:</em></p>\n<ul><li>Accurate crosshairs and possible customizability.</li><li>Ability to toggle off in-game monitor effect, and lessen bloom.</li><li>A gamma / in game brightness\u00a0setting.</li><li>Key bindings for weapon equipping / unequipping (aka; Scroll Wheel or D-Pad Up / Down on Gamepad).</li><li>You now start with your weapon equipped and a setting may be added so you have the option to have this or not.</li><li>Audio settings will now save properly.</li><li>Cancel button is fixed (Graphics settings).</li><li>Fixed missing sound classes on some audio.</li><li>Added Mouse sensitivity settings for overall vertical and horizontal looking.</li><li>Cyber-Heavies now have a weakness (back energy tanks), and are actually much slower as they should be now. They are also larger.</li><li>Projectiles no longer kill other enemies that are of the same class (Enemies will not murder each other).</li><li>Improved Cyber-Guards' shock baton effects and added SFX when active.</li><li>Added metal projectile impact sounds, improved decals and added proper physical materials on characters. As well as default projectile reactions.</li><li>Tweaked and slightly improved AI.</li><li>And perhaps more...?
