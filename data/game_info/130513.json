The game aims to explore the concept of social indifference by making the player reflect on how an apparently banal environment, such as life in a big city, can be a huge challenge to a homeless person. The game adopts a minimalist style, seeking to focus the player solely on the essential elements of the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a6/5a6e2b91ddf9b76e31155a30cb5f7833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedro_rosa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
