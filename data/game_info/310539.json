Inspired by my mother's hope to travel around the world I wanted to make a game where you get to relax and see a few things.\u00a0<br/><br/>This is currently a work in progress, but I plan to add more to China and Switzerland, as well as adding Egypt, Italy, Vietnam and Lapland. This is more of a passion project, but as this was born out of not being able to afford gifts I figured I may as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy and feel free to inform me on what needs to be added to really make the countries feel right and anything extra the game as a whole could use!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-19T06:13:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/807/807662e4e873ec5d9d89a5f3a555d746.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ghostbom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
