The game is the third instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to Entombed. In the game, aristocrat adventurer Sir Arthur Pendragon is trapped on board a haunted galleon and must free the soul of its captain. The game is presented in a 3D isometric format.</p>\n<p>The Pendragon series was created and designed by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, with Ultimate founders Tim and Chris Stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development. The game's setting and graphics were heavily inspired by HMS\u00a0Victory and the surrounding city of Portsmouth. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release. Critics were divided over the game's graphics and re-usage of sprites, but criticised the game for its vast similarities to its predecessors. It was followed by a final instalment to the series, Dragon Skulle, which was released later in 1985.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb1e2c4e326f664fe477d7946d60381.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Ultimate Play the Game"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Rare", "Ultimate Play the Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
