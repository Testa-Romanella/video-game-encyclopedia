No, but this is the most I have ever done! <br/></p>\n<p>There's not much of a UI, but the professor said that was okay.</p>\n<p>The story is that you are a time traveling car, and it is alive for some reason. It is looking for its time traveling companions. None of that is clear by the small amount of game play that I have made. If I work on this game further, I would like to add levels at different time periods.<br/></p>\n<p>What am I proud of? I think it looks nice! It's supposed to be the future, if that wasn't obvious. I made the skybox really colorful and the bridge that the car drives on have a star pattern. I liked how it looked but it seemed a little overwhelming. In order to counteract that, I made most of the additional items on the bridge white so that it didn't clash with the other colors.</p><p>I could have made it so the car doesn't spin so wildly, but I think it's fun this way.<br/><br/>A simple tutorial showed me how to make textures move. I applied this to the bridge/road. That knowledge also helped make the platforms move.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T13:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd4ae6144b4ed8da5587be5bbd0bae19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Easily Forgotten"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
