Grab planes and boats and shake people out of it, sending them right to their munchy death. Watch out, though! Some of the people got a nasty disease, so you better drop them on the island before your cute fishes get a taste of \u2018em!</p>\n<p>Every now and then, your fish population will multiply. But beware, because the more hungry mouths to feed, the harder it gets. If all of your fish die, or 5 fish have died throughout the game, you\u2019ll get game over and have to start back at square one!</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 Controls</em></p>\n<p><em>Mouse enthousiast rejoice!</em>\u00a0This entire game can be enjoyed with your mouse only.
