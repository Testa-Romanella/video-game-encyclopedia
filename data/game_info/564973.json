While getting stuck is already associated with failure it is not the only thing that fits the theme. Some levels require you to progress by moving in a certain direction, but moving too far will cause you to fail the level.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember to leave a rating and comment with feedback! :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:02:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/828bb28d28ed8110afc70854e7ba6f59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mytheria Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
