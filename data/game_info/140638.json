You have 100 peds to get as high a score as you can and you can control the escalator speed by either slowing it down in order to accumulate as many peds as possible or speeding it up in order to launch them forwards. When activating either mechanic you have to click the appropriate button when the arrow is as far as possible to the right of the bottom bar in order to get the best results possible. Once you have pressed the button once you have to press it again while the arrow is inside the allocated space in order to successfully launch the peds. If you miss time the click the whole process will be reset and you will have to wait for a cool down\u00a0period.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/9055abbf1e6740e0f6528239decff74e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Franzenza"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
