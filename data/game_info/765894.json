There were a couple unexpected challenges in this project that I had to overcome, which made it a lot more gratifying to complete. For instance, creating a sphere of targets seemed like it would be pretty easy but I ended up having to do a lot of research into different methods of creating an evenly spaced sphere of points. I also struggled to create the arrows the guide you to the next target, since there could be targets above, below, in front, or behind you at any point.     </p>\n<p>If I were to go back and change anything about this game, I would add more options for generating the sphere, such as size, distance, density, and maybe even generating only a portion of the sphere so that you don't have to constantly look behind you or directly up or down.\u00a0\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T12:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99ef67c37d0f49f6fbbb4b9cc9e08e95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kelvination"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
