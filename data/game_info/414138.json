You will have to repeatedly wander through the same corridor in order to uncover the causes of insanity and understand who you are. Be patient, and the house will open previously locked doors and show you frightening memories of the past. The narrative of the story is transmitted through the environment. Each item tells a story, relying on your imagination. Only the player decides to reveal the idea of the game and be in the center of events, escape or pass it as a room of fear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/9090b3ed7285844f3e40a12755530c31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMIKA_GAMES"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
