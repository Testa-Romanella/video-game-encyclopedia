This is a student game developed over the course of 5 weeks. It's a game where you play as a knight to attempt to beat you opponent by breaking your lance on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Artist Statement</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As this game is VR, I really wanted to make the game visually pleasing, I had 5 animation students working on numerous models and textures. The theme I was going for is a really eerie and dark environment, creating a more serious atmosphere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to focus the more detailed models on the players weapons, adding specular shaders to these models with normal maps and reflections because these are the closest to the players view. Closely followed by the opponent and atmospehric effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Collaborators</strong></p>\n<p>Design</p>\n<ul><li><p>Gary Reid</p></li></ul>\n<p>Programming</p>\n<ul><li><p>Troy Martens</p></li></ul>\n<p>Animation</p>\n<ul><li><p>Toni Giacopelli</p></li><li><p>Isabelle Britton</p></li><li><p>Rebecca Owen</p></li><li><p>Dylan Marcer</p></li><li><p>Lizzet Arias Rhor</p></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/177/177b245276898f6f5b9759e40cb47a2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gary Reid"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
