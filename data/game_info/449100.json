Designed with the Seven Deadly Sins in mind, the player must confront each demon by defeating them in specialized mini games.\u00a0When confronting Greed, for example, the player must bet their own points and choose between randomly valued packages to reach a target value range in a bizarre take on Black Jack. The player should also be careful not to give into their own greed and lose it all.\u00a0The overall goal is to overcome impulses and defeat all the demons. The problem being, giving in is just too much fun.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T07:13:18", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dayvson"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
