{"id": 187051, "slug": "echo-maze", "name": "Echo Maze", "name_original": "Echo Maze", "description": "<p>Echo Maze is a first-person maze-navigation game with a unique twist. The player view is restricted to a flashlight size area making it harder to see where you are going and easier to get lost. To help players navigate, they have the option to perform a sonar / echolocation scan of the maze. The scan shows a brief top-down view of the maze's walls before returning to the player view. </p><p>Be careful using the scan because the timer does not stop while it is in use. Use it too much and you'll run out of time. Use it too little and you won't know which way to go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e44fc201809d6ce4feced31ed3d306f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["20kgRhesusGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
