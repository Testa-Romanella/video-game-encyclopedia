The plan was for the first release to allow loading levels generated with the Donjon Random Dungeon Generator, but unfortunately, this feature was only partly finished. Hopefully, you'll be able to load new levels already in the first post-jam update.</p>\n<p>Post-Jam I have many ideas I'd like to explore, including procedurally generated levels and items, and expansion of pretty much all mechanics.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and try not to die!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:15:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79c/79c791e394ac5fc10390e2a1e87cede0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Huyderman"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
