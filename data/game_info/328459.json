I am Anindo Neel Dutta from Cyclone Games Inc. I am making a game which I like to call Skull and Bones. It's a horror FPS game. The ALPHA2 version of the game is now available for download!!!\u00a0</p>\r\nThe story:\r\n<p>You were admitted in a mental hospital for treatment of your mental illness. The evil Dr. Bones had turned every patient and Doctors of the hospital to Zombies with his special serum. But, somehow you managed to escape. Now, you have to stroll through Dr. Bones\u2019 secret base to take down Dr. Bones. But, beware!!! The zombies do not like intruders.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>As the story suggests, you have to take down the zombies created by Dr. Bones. You'll be put in an eerie building which is Dr. Bones' base (At least that's what it's supposed to be). You have to kill the zombies that come in your way and find a key to pass through each level.\r\n</p>\r\nOur goal:\r\n<p>The 32% of India's population stay below poverty line. We are going to do charity from the donations we get from the game.\u00a070% of the total raise will be spent on charity. Your money may make someone's life better.</p>\r\nSocial:\r\n<p>Website:\u00a0https://cyclone-games-wixsite.com/index</p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0https://instagram.com/cyclone.games</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming and level design: Anindo Neel Dutta</p>\n<p>Composer: Isak Erlandson</p>\n<p>Send feedback and tell me what us think about the game and how can we improve it.\u00a0If anyone of you do any play through of SnB on your YouTube channel\u00a0then don't hesitate to share the video down below in the comments.
