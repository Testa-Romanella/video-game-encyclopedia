Off course,\u00a0I\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0team to work\u00a0with,\u00a0as\u00a0I\u00a0am\u00a0only\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0developers.</p>\n<p>My team consisted of Lisa Sijnstra(me), Mimosa Lehtinen(the lone artist), Dennis van der Loo(developer), Rens van Aggelen(designer) and Alireza Doustdar(designer). This team had a rough time making this prototype, but that is not making any of us any less proud of the product.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you have just survived a big flood taking most of the Netherlands with it. A small Island, depicted with the Martini Tower as a windmill for energy, is where you and a few other citizens managed to survive. You were able to make an emergency dam, but you will need to strengthen it, as well as trying to keep your citizens happy and alive. You have been chosen as the mayor.</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, this game only works on android phones, as it was designed for phones, but I was not in possession of a mac, which ruled out the iOS development. <br/></p>\n<p>Use the icon up here as your playing field, and get to surviving!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343842759156039819775b7a3a6bb5e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Anna Lisa Sijnstra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
