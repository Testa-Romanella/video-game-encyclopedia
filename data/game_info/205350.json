You can't do anything, just watch the two neural networks learn to play Pong. I learned how to do this from a udemy course by\u00a0Penny de Byl. You can find the link here\u00a0https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-with-unity/. I would recommend having experience with unity, although it's not necessary. You can learn more about neural networks here. This guy explains the concepts and not much of the code so if that is more your cup of tea then go for it:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/6534fba6962b202203e0a7166c28d7e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zanetheninja17"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
