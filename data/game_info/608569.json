{"id": 608569, "slug": "jetborne-racing", "name": "Jetborne Racing", "name_original": "Jetborne Racing", "description": "<strong>Jetborne Racing</strong> is an online multiplayer air racing game from the creator of VTOL VR. Pilot a high performance jet aircraft through challenging courses in a race to the finish. Fly in VR (recommended) or on desktop with either virtual or physical HOTAS controls. Compete in up to 8-player online races or run hot laps to rank in global lap-time leaderboards. Get immersed in the heart-pounding sensation of flying over Mach 1 through tight and and technical race courses. Do you have what it takes for a podium position?<h3>Take Control</h3>Fly using the innovative and immersive virtual stick and throttle, popularized by VTOL VR, or bind your hardware HOTAS! The key to victory is mastering control of your aircraft and finding the perfect racing line. Life-like aerodynamics and physics are simulated, so fundamental racing concepts like braking points and apexes apply.  If you're familiar with road racing, you may need to adjust your technique -- there's now a third dimension and instead of being limited by traction, you need to consider the limits of G-forces on the pilot! <br/><br/><h3>Feel the Need</h3>Throttle up your lightweight race jets and propel yourself at supersonic speeds around winding courses. You can only handle so much force before you begin to black out -- if you carry too much speed into the corner, you might lose control! Will you risk G-LOC (G-force induced loss of consciousness) to come out in first on the other side? Can you ride the fine line between pushing the limits and wiping out in a blaze of glory?<br/><br/><br/><h3>Get Competitive</h3>Host online races for up to 8 players or play offline to chase the ghost of your own best lap and set personal records. Find the perfect racing line and shave milliseconds from your lap time to climb the global leaderboards. Customize the racing experience with options for damage, powerup items, laps, respawns, etc.<h3>Boost Your Advantage</h3>Enable items to take the action to the next level.  Pick up shields, cannons, missiles, tractor beams, mines, and more to secure your lead or battle your way to the top.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T02:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aad9d3658247a22b4c102aa5a7e7814.jpg", "website": "http://jetborneracing.bdynamicsstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Boundless Dynamics"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boundless Dynamics"], "esrb_rating": null}
