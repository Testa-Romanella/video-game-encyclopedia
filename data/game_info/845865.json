In particular, this game contains Adult themes such as Body Horror, mentions of cigarettes, loud burst of noises and strobing lights and disturbing visuals, et al.<br/>Now that's out of the way -- Sit back and enjoy the ride, this work is yet to be done!        The game is still in the demo phase, and about half of the game is what I consider 'done'<br/>... So please stay tuned, will you.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<em>There would be a family gathering, they said.<br/>There surely would be your family residing in this exact position presented in the letter, they said.<br/>Follow the direction and you shall meet your family after a god-knows-how long has it been since you last met them, they said.<br/></em>\n<em>They said so.</em>\n<p>You, as a very man, are in a severed quest of locating your home for annual Christmas Family Gathering (CFG).<br/>But upon successfully injecting yourself into the so-called your family house, it was revealed that the house was in fact, nothing but deception -- Lies. Obsoletion. Left-to-rot-away.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong><em>Yet never give your hopes up!</em></strong>\n<p>Even though there is no visible human race, let alone your familys' trace was left, this still remains a fact: It was the very place where your family had been living on for a long time. It's just that they have since moved unto another position a long, long time ago.</p>\n<p>Your only hope to find your family's current location, is now nothing but a remains of what used to be a successful addition to you and your family's house; A mysterious videotape playing device, and an one (1) videotape.</p>\n<p>Are you ready to reunite with your family yet again?</p>\n\n<p>A standalone tester type beat of the game, BA\u030aA\u030aB\u00d6SA\u030aA\u030aNGJA\u030aA\u030aR.<br/></p>\n<p>'BA\u030aA\u030aB\u00d6SA\u030aA\u030aNGJA\u030aA\u030aR' is a videotape in a videogame form -- You will watch yourself belonging to unconventional places, meet inexplicable people and situations: All thanks  to the old videotapes your former self have recorded using a Hi-tech, bleeding-edge, state-of-art videotape system. Available for you to utilize it to find the clues behind your mysterious past, and to extent, your family.</p>\n<p>To word it differently, it is a 3-D, semi-horror adventure game / interactible diorama of sorts: Taking heavy inspirations from theatre of absurd, surrealism, many works of the internet user 'PilotRedSun', and most  importantly, 200X-era internet humours such as 'Youtube Poop' and amateur motion films made with 'Garry's mod' and 'Source Filmmaker'.</p>\n<p>Sit back, and enjoy as the visages of your forgotten past enfloods your oculus -- Even the blink of an eye could lead you to somewhere else.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD / L stick to move</li><li>Mouse / R stick to pan the camera</li><li>Mouse wheel / D-pad up/down to zoom in/out</li><li>Shift / Left Bumper to sprint (if you can)</li><li>ESC to pause the gam</li></ul>\n<p>As the work is unfinished, there are many nooks and crannies that needs to be ironed out; Afterall, the reason I'm putting this demo out is to aid the development from the potential feedbacks and bug reports I could get.<br/>Therefore any bug reports and constructive criticism are always more than welcome.<br/>And while that's cooking, you can check out the game's micro-progresses on my Twitter page: (@ZIKBAKGURI)<br/><br/>Oh.
