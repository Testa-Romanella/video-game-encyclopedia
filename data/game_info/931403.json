It is nothing but a relaxation or a\u00a0stress relief game. You can drive around this city alone. There is no traffic, no interactions, no goals, no time limits, no easter eggs ect. Just a big enough city model to get lost\u00a0and a car.\u00a0Its driving simulation is not even advanced.\u00a0 I did not add engine sounds for tranquility reasons.\u00a0So if you want to donate, please be sure.</p>\n<p>Rar document includes:</p>\n<p>-Game</p>\n<p>-Maps</p>\n<p>-Soundtrack</p>\n<p>-Screenshots</p>\n<p>For Donations: I have modeled everything and made almost every textures by myself. No assets used from internet. I have made soundtracks too.\u00a0 I want to make more games, art and comics.\u00a0I have modeled and sketched almost every aspect of the other games\u00a0and wrote scenarios for them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for your interest,\u00a0</p>\n<p>DIY-ART</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T09:20:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b7/5b721f81d9e16cd216fd3fa2406d9be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DIY ART"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
