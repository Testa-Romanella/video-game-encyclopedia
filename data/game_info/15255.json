Cubotrox is an addictive puzzle game that challenges you to complete pixel art images by managing falling neon-colored cubes. Catch, drop and rotate your way to victory in a game with retro-futuristic neon visuals and synth-retro-wave music that excels at being \u201ceasy to play, hard to master\u201d. <br/><br/><br/>EASY MECHANICS THAT ADD UP TO KILLER MIND-BREAKING CHALLENGESThe game can be summed up in a real easy way: you have pixel art images that must be completed by managing some neon-colored cubes that are constantly appearing from all sides of the screen. You must manage these cubes to complete the image. Mechanics are rather simple: catch, drop and rotate the cubes and rotate all the screen. But as you progress you start to face increasing challenges related to the limited time, the management of the cubes, the frequency of the cubes\u2019 fall, etc. But there\u2019s no use on explaining this: go play the game. By minute 1 you will say \u201chehe, this is stupidly simple\u201d; but by minute 20 you will be fully engaged and screaming \u201cdamn! I didn\u2019t think of that! Let\u2019s re-start this level AGAIN!\u201d. Believe us: you will end admitting that Cubotrox is a masterclass on \u201ceasy to play, hard to master\u201d. <br/><br/><br/>A BEAUTIFUL ENDLESS STREAM OF PIXEL ARTCubotrox\u2019 puzzles are comprised by pixel art images that must be completed through cube management. Don\u2019t fool ourselves: there\u2019s an ongoing pixel art craze and we\u2019re not trying to fight against it. We love pixel art and Cubotrox is like an interactive pixel art gallery where every piece is turned into a puzzle to be solved. And it also is a HUGE pixel art gallery: +100 levels to be played and even an endless mode (coming soon) that dares you to find your skills\u2019 limit. Get better at Cubotrox and rotate your way to the first positions in a global world ranking for both level and endless modes. <br/><br/><br/>LET\u2019S TURN GREAT INDIE GAMES INTO AWESOME PUZZLES!So we were building this kick-ass pixel art library when we realized the only way of making it really perfect was by adding some of our favorite beauties. We contacted pixel artists and gamedevs we admire to ask them for permission to add their creations to our games. It turns out to be that the indie community is freaking cool and most of them agreed almost instantly. <br/>So now we have proudly included levels based on games we love such as Nuclear Throne, Enter the Gungeon, Elliot Quest, They Bleed Pixels, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and many more!<br/><br/><br/>ALL ABOUT THE GAME FEEL // WHY THIS TEXT IS ALMOST USELESSLet\u2019s be brutally honest: this text is almost useless. And why is that? Because Cubotrox is ALL bite and no bark. Damn, see the our video: it is just little cubes being rotated and dropped at seemingly simple pixel-art images. We know. All people start by being a bit skeptical with Cubotrox because of its perceived simplicity but almost all those people ends addicted to it once they start playing the game.
