According to their official website, the game reads:\r\n</p>\n<p>\"Tara and the Magical Typing Adventure is a 2D platform runner where you guide Tara, a little explorer, in order to avoid obstacles and pits to reach her destination by typing the correct key that each obstacle is assigned to. The more keys you get correct, the more confident Tara becomes. Therefore, she'll get increasingly faster until you reach your destination.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>The game seems to have been canceled due to the devs being unmotivated to continue with the project. I managed to find a copy of the game in the comments of the website, but I didn't manage to go very far due to a few glitches and a pirate screen triggering all the time. I'm only sharing this here to spread more awareness of this game and hopefully show the devs that the game should keep going forward, even if what I have is a badly functioned build.\r\n</p>\n<p>---Dev notes---\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>All names mentioned here are not from real people, they're only here for story and immersion purposes.
