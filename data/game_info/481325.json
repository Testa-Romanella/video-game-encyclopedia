Along the way you have to dodge pesky greenhouse gases by tapping left or right.</p>\n<p>Each collision with a greenhouse gas causes your beam to lose some energy. If you keep grazing the gases, it\u2019s game over.</p>\n<p>Your journey through the air is divided into levels \u2014 each one an actual layer of the atmosphere! Making it through the stratosphere into space is a great accomplishment! It means your ray has done its part to cool down the Earth and offset global warming. As a reward, the game converts your Joules into Jewels, that you can use to purchase interesting science trivia in the shop!</p>\n<p>We also have a helpful teacher\u2019s guide for the game if you are a teacher and interested in using this game in the classroom!</p>\n<p>The easiest mode is the pre-industrial past, so there aren\u2019t as many greenhouse gases to dodge. The hardest difficulty corresponds with a much more polluted future. Light-speed reaction times will be needed to conquer this mode, since greenhouse gases are so tightly packed in the air.</p>\n<p>Infrared Escape was designed by Samuel Dassler, Professor Dargan Frierson, Amara Kitnikone, Rikki Parent, and Ben Peterson. Make sure to crank the volume on Dargan\u2019s pulsing electronic dance soundtrack!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:32:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7d3ceeefc9e1d0525514cbe2f54b80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EarthGamesUW"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
