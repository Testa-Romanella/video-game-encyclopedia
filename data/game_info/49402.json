A game you can let your child play without having to worry about micro transactions, unlockables or trading cards. Play with Gilbert takes inspiration from classic platformers and adds a touch of sandbox to the mix. Gilbert, or any customized kitty can go around the levels and find their friends, collect all the pink fishies, or, manage to grab the golden fish from ninja lady.<br/><br/>There are four levels in the game. Gilbert's neighbourhood, Timmy and Tommy's house, the park and Gilbert's Play Gym. Each level has it's own kitty's to be found and has tons of places to explore, fishies to discover and collect as well as meeting other inhabitants.<br/><br/><br/>You can create your own kitty to play with. Complete with accessories to wear and be able to choose from a varieties of fur. You can name him or her and it'll be proudly displayed everywhere in the game. Play with... Whiskers ?<br/><br/><br/>Play with Gilbert also has a completely dynamic day / night cycle system implemented. You can choose at which time of the day to start the game. The cycle can be adjusted to how long a day takes, from ten minutes to one hour.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Parents! As a father myself it was important to me that the design behind this game evokes a sense of exploration. The game started as a small side project meant for my 4 year old daughter to play. She loved it so much that I decided to make it into a more full fledged experience. Everything is designed around my observations watching her play and also through her own suggestions. I hope that your own child has as much fun as mine has.<br/><br/>Also important to note is that there are no micro transactions, unlockables (everything is unlocked from the get go) nor are there any cards or achievements. These things are thrown at children constantly and I am personally not a fan of them so I decided to leave these things out.<br/><br/>The game is about having fun, trying to find all the kittens, collect all the fish or try to get the golden fish. The end reward is a nice fireworks show, nothing more. I wanted to keep the rewards to a minimum and something that means more than some unlockable reward or a high score, something that can be experienced.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Play as Gilbert or your own custom kitty.<br/></li><li>Fully dynamic day / night cycle.<br/></li><li>Start the game at whatever (in-game) time you want.<br/></li><li>Seasonal events (Halloween and Christmas).<br/></li><li>Choose which level to start and travel between levels during gameplay.<br/></li><li>Two in-game seasons, summer and winter.
