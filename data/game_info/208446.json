It's up to you to contain these massive powers of destruction, with the help of your spaceship, the Ortogonalis, a unique vessel with Hyperspace travel capabilities. <br/><br/>Goal: <br/><br/>Contain the supernova by closing the hyperspace borders (blue borders). You do this by changing the color of the borders from Blue to Purple. <br/>Don't let the supernova grow into it's maximum size, or else we're doomed! <br/><br/>Instructions: <br/><br/>There are only two buttons: A and Escape. <br/><br/>Button 'A' selects game, changes the direction of the spaceship, enters wormholes, and enters the blue borders. <br/><br/>It's important for you to keep track of the spaceships current direction. <br/><br/>Button 'Escape' pauses the game and restarts. <br/><br/>Use the first level for practice purposes. You'll need it in order to achieve highscores! <br/><br/>The faster you are with the controls, the more you'll score. <br/><br/>Requisites: <br/><br/>HTML5/CANVAS browser. Warning: I've noticed sound issues with chrome browsers. If possible use Firefox instead. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/341154b7248aa48f0e01db40de0fc388.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pjimmy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
