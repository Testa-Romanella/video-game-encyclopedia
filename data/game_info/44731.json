Grandson enjoyed it so much is asking if you doing another.. Graphics were wonderful. Each story kept max amazed he's started from the beginning now.\"<br/><br/><strong>Jeni R., on 16. September 2016:</strong><br/>\"My 4 year old's first game Wanted to finally introduce our 4 year old to games and chose this for its cute characters and innocence. He needed some gentle explanation for the controls and the idea that he could let go of things to try them in places but after that, he loved it. His eyes lit up on the second level when he saw a little boy Zwuggel play with a train, enthused to Mama &amp; after stopping, he emulated the girl climbing across the waterfall using sticks for hand and footholds.
