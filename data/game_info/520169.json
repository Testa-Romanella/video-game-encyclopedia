Spectrum characters are very different from each other, each with unique abilities. Despite this, they all form a unit, since their essences make the existence of visible light itself possible. This is because white light is composed of red, green and blue. Without these, white would not exist; and without white light there would be no colors. The mechanics and dynamics of the video game come from this premise, achieving an immersive experience.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Agustin Luna: </strong></p><p>Programmer, Technical Artist, Game Designer\u00a0</p>\n<p>agustinluna23@gmail.com</p>\n<p><strong>Juan Pablo Santoro: </strong></p>\n<p>3D Artist, Character animator, Level Designer, Game Designer</p>\n<p>0juanpablosantoro@gmail.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sabrina Cinzer: </strong></p>\n<p>Concept Artist,\u00a0 UX &amp; UI Designer, Motion Designer, Game Designer</p>\n<p>sabrinacinzer@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T08:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bf/3bff54aed48f265e2fa4e9b9ae2205b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sabrinacinzer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
