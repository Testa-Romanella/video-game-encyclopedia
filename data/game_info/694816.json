This is a fun game that focuses on an aspect of life that many of us struggle with: focusing. </strong><br/><p><em>The concept is simple, really. If you focus you can achieve anything you want and if you don't, you'll struggle. As it is in real life, so it is within our game. If you lose focus, the game forgets you. As soon as you lose the items from your view, they respawn back to where they were. But if you manage to keep in focus, you will leave a mark that will stay.\u00a0<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><em>Life is like a box of chocolates... yeah, a super cheesy quote but it holds true. You never know what situation life will put you in - but one thing is certain: whatever it is, you will just have to find your standing and work your way through it. Thats what this game is all about. Not an easy task... but if you focus, you can do everything. The real world never provides clear directions anyways.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>So, enjoy! But as it is  in real life so it is in this game - it's all up to you.</em></p>\n<p><strong>\ud83e\udd13 THE SERIOUS ASPECT \ud83e\udd13</strong><br/></p><p>The game *focuses* both on raising awareness as well as training the player's ability to remain focused through the use of  fun game mechanics, interesting challenges and a safe environment for trial and error. <br/></p><p>In hopes of promoting bigger proactiveness and engagement the game  relies on the player's ability to <strong>interpret the situation </strong>rather than follow given instructions.\u00a0<br/></p><p>The aim of the game is to develop player's <strong>f</strong><strong>ocusing strenght, personal adaptability</strong> and <strong>resilience to failure</strong> as well as hopefully enable player's to<strong> learn how not to give up</strong>. We feel like that's a good message to take home.\r\n  </p>\n<p>And we designed this game from teenage players to adults in mind - the mechanics are fun and fun is motivational. So, you know, just don't get distracted or something... and you got this!</p><p>\ud83d\udc49 we discussed the potential of using this game to collect data for scientific  research. An example would be a research question like: <strong>how goal setting and environment recognition influence  goal achieving</strong>, possible by possing a simple question at the start of the game and comapring it to the resuluts. <br/></p><p>\ud83d\udc49 at some point in the future we wish to explore the therapeutic\u00a0potential of this\u00a0 game as training for those who struggle with ability to focus <br/></p>\n<p>But thats all far in the future.<br/></p><p><strong>For now, you </strong><strong>Get\u00a0what\u00a0U\u00a0see.\u00a0</strong>\n</p><p>*The developement of this game continues.
