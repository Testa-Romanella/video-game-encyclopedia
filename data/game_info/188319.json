For game functionality, keep to Blueprints. It's much safer, faster\u00a0to work with, and generally better. The C++ classes can and should only be used when doing complicated mathematical checks, since doing that in Blueprints quickly makes it become spaghetti-code for real.</p><p>Check out the\u00a0 GitHub Repo for the source code.
