This demo features 1 tutorial level and 1 unlockable bonus room\u00a0showcasing some of the unique mechanics of this brand new genre. Because of the robust GMS2 physics engine, many more mechanics can be implemented to fit any theme the game takes on.</p>\n<p>The vapor-wave aesthetic is a placeholder theme implemented because I\u00a0am not an artist, I am an engineer and am much more proficient at designing systems than sprites and sounds. I would love to partner with artists, level designers, writers, or other creative teams\u00a0to flesh out this project in the future. Don't hesitate to reach out.</p><p><strong>NOTE: Game designed to run on\u00a0Windows 10 or greater\u00a0via a wired connection to a\u00a0PS5 Dualsense\u00a0controller.
