An amazingly functional game with perfect sprites and lovely design, Not a JSAB Clone throws aside useless garbage like story, characters, and conclusion, and just throws its players into\u00a0 a garbage main menu with no exposition whatsoever! Amazing, isn't it?</p>\n<p>I made this game in, like, 8 weeks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T06:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d5d6a87bc942c9168d5d6048ce0acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shreesh_Fuup"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
