The game has 2 modes: a small storyline and a custom game.<br/>\r\nIn the plot, the character wakes up in an incomprehensible place and gradually remembers what happened, while building his assumptions about where he got into.<br/>\r\nIn a user game, the player sets the level of complexity and can set, or use the ready-made seed for generation.
