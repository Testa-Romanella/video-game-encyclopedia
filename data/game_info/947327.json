You start with a simple sloop, but with a couple cannons you will climb to the top with huge ships of the line!</p>\n<p>Controls cuz I forgor to add them in game:<br/>- WASD to control the ship, W and S hoists and unhoists the sail, no need to keep holding!<br/>- Click the starboard or larboard side of your ship to fire those cannons.<br/>- Drive over collectibles to pick them up.<br/>-\u00a0If a ship has surrendered, it will have a\u00a0halo around it. Click and hold it to abandon your current ship and claim the new one. Claimed ships are restored to 50% health.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T09:49:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdc/cdcceaedab990f28c72f7bb32d49a0b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Argore"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
