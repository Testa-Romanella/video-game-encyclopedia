You really need to plan and time your movements to complete the levels. Playing with gravity when you can only propel yourself in two directions is often tricky. </p><p>The best way to get a good feeling of the game is to try out our DEMO ! </p><p>You are Captain Miaou, traveling back to your planet with a cargo full of high energy food. Hit by a meteorite, you're ejected and your food scattered all around the 5 orbiting moons. How will you survive, lost in space?</p><p>2D physics puzzle plateformer.</p><p>Your only chance of survival is to grab energy food to propel yourself forward. Too few energy and you'll starve to death, too much and you'll explode! When you eat, your cat gets stronger and bigger, but deflates each time you propel. A bit of strategy is involved you can't spam your control buttons like in other plateformers.</p><p>Make way through 5 moons displaying different physical properties, adapt your gameplay and tweak your cat's suit to survive!</p><ul><li>60 Levels</li><li>5 moons with different gravity and bounciness</li><li>Upgrade system (suit capacity, visor, weighted armor, propulsor, attack, emergency food)</li><li>Hidden levels</li><li>Huge bosses</li><li>Fun progressive gameplay features (pikes, bumpers, magnetic winds, glue, teleports, falling rocks, laser beams, stalling zones, various monster types, etc.)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7d/f7df4de4b4e665c5d3b21a7beee813e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["paifu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
