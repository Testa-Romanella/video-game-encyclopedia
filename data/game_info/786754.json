{"id": 786754, "slug": "hostile-squashedskinner", "name": "hosTILE (SquashedSkinner)", "name_original": "hosTILE (SquashedSkinner)", "description": "<p>This game is a portfolio project for my university dissertation, titled \"<em>Utilizing Multiple Procedural Generation Techniques to Construct Organic 2D Levels</em>\".</p>\n<p>[WEBGL NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE ZIP UNTIL IT IS RESOLVED :)]</p>\n<p>The overworld was created by using Perlin Noise to generate a noise map. The gradient magnitudes of each pixel\u00a0determines the biome type of each cell, which is translated to both a render texture (world map) and to a tile map (game level). Natural resources are then instantiated in the appropriate place.</p>\n<p>The cave levels are constructed using Cellular automata, a process that randomly assigns a grid of size n^2 with either \"alive\" or \"dead\" cells. These cells are then compared to their neighbours to determine their next state using birth and death rates. Four iterations of this produces an environment of snaking tunnels and open space.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to build a boat to escape the island. To do so, the player must harvest resources found around the island.</p>\n<p>Be wary of the slimes that roam the island, they will target you or the local wildlife to chase down. On top of this, be sure to stay hydrated and eat food to recover your health, having no water will drain your health very quickly! Food can be harvested from the plant life or from hunting rabbits or ducks. Meat will grant more health than vegetables.</p>\n<p>You can also build structures in build mode to keep away from the monsters or block animals in a pen. To get started, all you need to do is craft walls using five pieces of wood, then click on the tile(s) you wish to build on!</p>\n<p>Finding the cave entrance will transport you to the caves where you can gather more iron, which is scarce on the overworld.</p>\n<p>There is a basic crafting system which allows for the creation of items such as:</p>\n<p>- Armour to take more hits before dying</p>\n<p>- Bow and Arrows for long range engagements</p>\n<p>- Spyglass to get a better perspective of the play-space</p>\n<p>- Walls to build a home</p>\n<p>- Boat parts to complete the game</p>\n<p>The level generation was the primary aspect for the project with the game mechanics being\u00a0implemented at the end of the project. I'm very happy with the outcome having taken on such a large task.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Free download for the soundtrack here! -\u00a0https://josephskinner72.wixsite.com/website/music-by-me</p>\n<p>If you wish to give any feedback, please leave a comment or fill out a survey linked here:\u00a0https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/GKC6FS6</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:10:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e36/e3664bd7dbcd46b5d283bd70fe4bc1b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SquashedSkinner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
