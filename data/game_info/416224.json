This means no pay to win items in the game (on a mobile game?! thats craaaazy!) yup that's right. We plan on having\u00a0 cosmetics and nothing that give players more power over another that hasn't bought items in game. The only power you can have is the power to dab on the competition with your\u00a0awesome looking ships!</p>\n<p><strong>What's in the Technical Demo:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>2 ships from 2 ship classes, Destroyer and Frigate Class with pre-loaded ship abilities.\u00a0</li><li>1 map, the Maginot belt,\u00a0an asteroid belt that borders human and Orcoid space which saw witness to a battle around one of the many observation posts build to warn of incursions by orc vessels.\u00a0</li><li>1 game mode (Deathmatch)</li><li>Bots\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Plan:</strong></p>\n<p>So here is the plan, in order to complete this game we need funding, and in order to get\u00a0 funding we are planning on announcing a crowd funding campaign, but in order for the crowdfunding campaign to get some traction we need some hype.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>That's where you come in, YOU are the ones who will decide if this game is something awesome or if it's back to the drawing board. Your enthusiasm for the game will fuel our conviction. So share the game, follow us on our social media profiles and get word out! Keep the game servers alive by donating on Patreon.</p>\n<p><strong>The future of the Game?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Immediate</em><em>\u00a0Future (adding stuff to this technical demo):</em></p>\n<ul><li>New Ship class, Battleships, Hard hitting vessels that are slow,\u00a0 tanky and mean as hell.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>early look at the first battleship class ship in it's grey-box\u00a0phase</em></p>\n<ul><li>New Map Abandoned mining outpost. A large mining complex that was owned by a wealthy mining company now lies abandoned as the threat of incursions by other factions has made it too dangerous to stay operational.</li><li>New turrets for each of the ship classes to side grade your ships with.</li><li>optimizations and bug fixing.</li></ul>\n<p><em>Far Future:</em></p>\n<p>When the game gets funded we will be working full time fleshing out the each of components of the game to deliver you the features listed at the very beginning of this page.</p>\n<p>Warfleet - Captains will have a rich lore being built in the background as this is our first serious IP, we wish to expand on this universe with other games in the future.\u00a0 At the initial release of Warfleet - Captains\u00a0much of this lore will be delivered through flavor text on ship descriptions and loading screens for maps. However! We plan to release updates that allow us to explore this universe more via PvE mode that begins to tell a tale of epic conquests, and tragedies alike.\u00a0In order for us to do this however, we need to make sure we are funded adequately to work on the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Good News?</strong></p>\n<p>We have done the ground work, the tech is in place and ready. Progress is going well on the creation of a robust customization system.\u00a0 From here it's all a matter of providing ourselves with a means to cover our expenses while we flesh out the game.<br/><br/>Living costs in Sri Lanka is nearly half that of western countries. What does that mean? well it means we don't need nearly as much funding as a typical indie team from Europe / US. To show some perspective getting $500 a month from Patreon will allow one member of the team to work on the game full time, in fact it will leave us some change that can be put into sever upkeep.\u00a0<br/><br/>This means the help we need to get this project up and on its feet is far less than what you would expect. In fact we estimated that roughly $30,000 will pay for everything\u00a0\u00a0 the team needs to work on the game for 1 year from the point of funding. This is adequate funding and\u00a0time for us to develop the game up to version 1.0 with the feature set outlined for version 1 (outlined at the top of the page).</p>\n<p><strong>The\u00a0Bad News?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Well he big one is that currently we can only support up to 20 CCU (concurrent users on our game ) this means we can only have up to 20 people IN A MATCH at any given time. In order to increase the concurrent user limit, we will need your support.</p>\n<p>\u00a0we are still a new indie team. Therefore we need to build faith with you, that we are capable of delivering on the goals we have outlined.</p>\n<p>We have used up all our resources at the point of releasing this technical demo, therefore in order for us to continue development we need to secure funds.</p>\n<p><strong>What can you do to help?</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Donate!\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>Well as of right now we use the photon engine to handle the networking, and you will notice that there are cues, these are in place because we don't have a package that can handle alot of concurrent user traffic. You can help us secure a boost to the concurrent user amount by donating enough so that we can purchase an upgrade to the photon services. <br/><br/><strong>You can either donate here, or head on over to our\u00a0Patreon on\u00a0:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/ironbloodgames</strong></p>\n<p><strong>where you can come and help us keep the project alive by getting a monthly subscription. Every dollar will help.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a02.
