Will Grace discover Duluth\u2019s secrets, or will she meet the same fate as her mother?<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Lore-enriched gameplay shown through unlockable journal pages, secret lore bits, and much more.</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Exotic items that drastically change the way the game is played.</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Randomly generated levels that make each run new and exciting!</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Beautiful environments and distinct enemies with special attack patterns!</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Enemies, items, and special NPCs inspired by Lovecraftian lore!</strong></li></ul><br/><br/><br/><strong>Traveler\u2019s guide to the Whispering Abyss</strong><br/><br/><strong>The Wandering Eyes</strong><br/>Half of a deadly pair and one of the more common enemies found in the Abyss. These eyes like to hunt in packs to overwhelm their prey rather than take it on alone. You should have nothing to worry about if facing one of these creatures, but be careful and don\u2019t dawdle on taking them out because they can very quickly become a problem. Take your gaze off a wandering eye, and the next time you spot it, you\u2019ll have way more than one to worry about. Standing and fighting a horde is a death sentence find a way to thin it out or take them out in bottleneck areas.<br/><br/><strong>Tendrils</strong><br/>The other half of a deadly pair and a common occurrence is the tendrils in the Abyss. Like the wandering eyes, these tendrils are weak, especially alone, but the danger lies in their ability to corner you. These tendrils occupy valuable space and rely on their friends to push you towards them for the kill. The easiest way to deal with a tendril is by being aware of your surroundings so as not to get pushed into their range. Tendrils cannot move horizontally, only lunge, and using this against them is paramount to your survival down there. Do not underestimate them or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/><strong>The Forgotten</strong><br/>Once humans just like you, the forgotten are special because they\u2019re the only monsters that can hit you from range. They want your attention elsewhere, so they get a perfect shot at you with the massive rocks they hurl. The forgotten have buried themselves in the ground, rooting themselves for greater durability and the ability to attack from range. Use this against them, as long as you keep moving, they won\u2019t be able to target you accurately. Don\u2019t ever double back against a forgotten, or you\u2019ll find yourself waking up at the pearly gates a bit too soon. If you\u2019re fast enough, you can get away with leaving them for last, but be warned, these creatures will take any chance to strike you with a lightning-quick boulder to the head.<br/><br/><strong>The Stalker</strong><br/>Stalkers like to watch their targets, then charge up a dash attack that only matches its power in speed. They say if you listen close enough, you can hear the huffs of a stalker tracking you at some points in the Abyss. Their tough hide makes them harder to take down than most enemies but not impossible and if it bleeds, it dies; remember that. Stay light on your feet, traveler, and never stay in the same place too long lest you want to feel the fate of the many unfortunate victims before you.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Ritual</strong> Consumes hp, enter a very strong berserk mode, increased dmg, speed, fire rate.<br/>Picking up this item consumes some of the user\u2019s hp to enter a beserked state, granting her increased dmg, speed, and fire rate.<br/>\u201cJust because I use some of their enchantments doesn\u2019t make me comparable to them.\u201d<br/>\u201cThis is a necessary evil. I can tolerate it this once.\u201d<br/>\u201cBreathe Grace it\u2019s just a little pain for a lot of damage.\u201d<br/>\u201cBlood Magic, the most painful of magics.\u201d<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Ricochet</strong> Chance for bullets to bounce to a nearby enemy<br/>Bullets have a chance to bounce to a nearby enemy causing damage.<br/>\u201cMom always knew I was a great shot. This just proves it.\u201d<br/>\u201cEfficient\u2026 Perfect.\u201d<br/>\u201cA bouncing bullet eh? I can work with this.\u201d<br/>\u201cWhat makes it bounce? Magic! Definitely magic.\u201d<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Tentacle</strong> Summons a tentacle that rotates around the player dealing a chunk of damage to the first enemy hit; tentacle then despawns and respawns after a short duration.<br/>Summons a friendly tentacle that will deal damage to enemies around the user. <br/>\u201cTurning them against each other\u2026 I never even thought to try that.\u201d<br/>\u201cTime for them to get a taste of their own medicine.\u201d<br/>\u201cFinally they get to feel my pain!\u201d<br/>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you help me, you won\u2019t be spared in the end.\u201d<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Double shot</strong> % chance to fire two bullets.<br/>Gives a chance to fire two bullets for the price of one.<br/>\u201cTwo is always better than one. Unless you ask my mother who would say one is plenty.\u201d<br/>\u201cTwo bullets to the face are better than one. Good riddance.\u201d<br/>\u201cMy revolvers never cease to surprise me.\u201d<br/>\u201cA surprise to be sure, but a very welcome one.\u201d<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Gambler\u2019s Choice</strong> A huge stat up for a huge stat down (randomized)<br/>Grants a random large stat up and a large stat down.<br/>\u201cIt\u2019s not gambling if you\u2019ve already made peace with everything you\u2019ve lost.\u201d<br/>\u201cGo on. If you give me something bad I\u2019ll make that work too. I\u2019ve had worse\u201d<br/>\u201cTime to be a god or time to run?\u201d<br/>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with a girl who\u2019s got nothing left to lose. She\u2019s crazy.\u201d<br/><br/></li><li>...
