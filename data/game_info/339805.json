{"id": 339805, "slug": "overnight-exhausted-boi-studios", "name": "Overnight (exhausted boi studios)", "name_original": "Overnight (exhausted boi studios)", "description": "<p>Overnight is a short, 5-10 minute story based game where you collect items for your three puppies\u00a0while simultaneously confronting your gradual loss of memory. As you explore the woods, you think\u00a0of memories from previous seasons and the nearing threat of winter. Spoiler: it's pretty sad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is one side quest during the events of Overnight. While not necessary to complete the game, it will slightly alter the ending.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has been a large labor of love, and I really tried to test my pixel art and music making\u00a0abilities with it. The OST, strategy guide, and story explanation\u00a0are all available for download on this same page. I highly suggest reading the story explanation after finishing the game, unless you want to make your own theories first :)</p>\n<p>This game would not have been remotely possible without the help and/or use of\u00a0<strong>Bitsy</strong> by Adam le Doux,\u00a0the\u00a0<strong>Bitsy Discord Server</strong>, <strong>Borksy Game Hacker</strong> by Ayolland, and a variety of Bitsy hacks including...</p>\n<ul><li><strong>bitsymuse</strong> by\u00a0David Mowatt</li><li><strong>directional avatar</strong> by\u00a0Sean S.
