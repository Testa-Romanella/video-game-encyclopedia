After an economic crash many members of your neighborhood have been left behind without a place to live. Occupy the old abandoned factory and decide how you want to live.<br/><br/>As you construct your habitat you will:<br/><br/><ul><li>Craft shelter<br/></li><li>Manage your workshop<br/></li><li>Acquire machines and equipment<br/></li><li>Manage your crew<br/></li><li>Automate construction<br/></li><li>Scavenge for materials and resources<br/></li><li>Farm food<br/></li><li>Sell products in the market<br/></li><li>Build machines from open-source blueprints<br/></li><li>Repair broken equipment<br/></li><li>Provide water and electricity to the community<br/></li><li>Share or sell your creations in the marketplace</li></ul><br/><br/>The core Common\u2019hood experience is a survival simulation where you grow your economy and your community. New characters will attempt to join your crew, and it will be in your hands to provide shelter, water, and food in exchange for their skills. Each character that joins will have their own unique story, helping you understand what led them to end up without a home. By working together, you will be able to provide shelter and facilities to improve the life of your community. This will involve farming and researching technologies to improve the way you generate food and resources.<br/><br/>Common\u2019hood has been inspired by the Maker Movement and all DIY initiatives that attempt to take re-claim production with a hands-on approach. In Common\u2019hood you will be able to design furniture, Tiny Homes, Architecture, farming rigs and all sorts of structures to improve your way of living. Nothing will be standard, all can be customized to your needs.<br/><br/><strong>Blueprints:</strong><br/><br/>Common\u2019hood uses a powerful grouping system that we call \u2018Blueprints\u2019. By grouping elements into blueprints, you will be able to automate construction or request it to be built by your community workers. Blueprints are the cornerstone of how Common\u2019hood allows you to grow a catalog of modular creations that could become amazing constructions. Blueprints are also the main online sharing format allowing players to download creations by others.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Marketplace (Online):</strong><br/><br/>Common\u2019hood will offer a marketplace for player\u2019s creations. You will be able to share your work in a \u2018creative commons\u2019 format, increasing your reputation and attracting skilled new members, or you can sell your creations getting the resources you will need to buy machines or parts that you might be missing. Larger creations might need many hours of work, so why not use the aid of fellow players and learn from what they have done already!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Dynamic Characters and Events:</strong><br/><br/>In Common\u2019hood, your community is your health. Only by growing your community you will be able to achieve larger goals. Each member that you recruit will have its own back-story and baggage. Dealing with your community\u2019s needs will be essential for creating a peaceful environment, which might not be an easy task.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Automate:</strong><br/><br/>Everything you can craft you will be able to automate if you have the right tools. Robots and machines will help you in streamlining the production of architecture and furniture, as well as objects that you can sell in the market. Go explore the factory while the robots take care of the rest.<br/><br/> <br/><strong>Grow your food:</strong><br/><br/>It will be in your hands to grow food and produce the resources you need to survive. This can be achieved by farming or developing technologies that might form for you! Automate food production by researching contraptions that can off-load the work from your shoulders and help you create a fully automated eco-system.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T23:37:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b8faa16a50ef8642fcf64ee1220f89.jpg", "website": "https://common-hood.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 9, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 43, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plethora Project"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Plethora Project"], "esrb_rating": null}
