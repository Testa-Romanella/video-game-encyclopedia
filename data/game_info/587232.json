This demo is a short taster of the whole game.</p>\n<p>SpacePants Games are a couple of old developers returning to the Genesis to try to create some nice new games.</p>\n<p>Everything is made from scratch, no engines are used, the toolset is completely written from nothing, and the game is in 100% 68000 assembler. We're recreating the environment from the mid 90s! :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to run it?</strong></p>\n<p>You will need a Genesis emulator. There are many good ones available, such as Blastem\u00a0. You can also use NesBox\u00a0to play online, though it appears you need a OneDrive account. Also Genesis Plus GX\u00a0seems to work online but the sound is broken.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T08:40:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b78c1af9520c9e81f0bbe743b99c151.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpacePantsGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
