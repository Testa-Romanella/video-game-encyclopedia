But hopefully you'll enjoy those 4 polished, very fine minutes! (jk its all a big buggy entangled mess of hard coded events)</p><p>After the jam ( 8 bits to infinity - revision jam btw, here is a link to the prototype this is based on that I made around 4-6 years ago:\u00a0https://dino0040.itch.io/marhaus) I'm even more convinced that this should become an actual mobile game; I'll probably continue to work on this one.<br/><br/>For anyone actually interested in the scoring, here are the combos I was able to check for before I was taken over by the sweet sweet relief of sleep:</p><p>\"Single\" to \"Quad\" kill - pretty self explanatory -\u00a0100 to 400 pts<br/>\"Kill Chain\" - kill\u00a0an enemy that also kills another enemy - 250 pts<br/>\"Traitor\" - Make an enemy shoot another one - 150 pts<br/>\"Suicide\" - Make an enemy kill itself - 200 pts<br/>\"Inside Man\" - Make an enemy kill another one, that also kills another enemy - 400 pts<br/>Every lost life costs you 10% of your score soooo... I probably should have only left you around 2-3 lifes for those few levels...<br/><br/>Well, thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:39:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c6/2c66eb08288fa38ab4ec222f79e67d4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dino0040", "Mr.Hippo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
