I was feeling pretty good beforehand as I had been finally getting my feet under me after a fairly long period of depression and anxiety. But after the rejection I could feel myself slip into the same thought patterns of hopelessness I had felt before I had begun getting help. But thanks to the help I had received I caught these thoughts before I fell into a spiral. In this moment I realised I really wanted to hold on to the progress I had made but it was going to be hard to that. So I made a game about that feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- press the keys displayed on the limbs to hold on</p>\n<p>- click and hold left mouse to pull limbs and climb</p>\n<p>- escape to close the game</p>\n\n<p>Music from https://filmmusic.io<br/>\"Sad Trio\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Touching Moments One - Pulse\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Bittersweet\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Sovereign Quarter\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>\"Despair and Triumph\" by Kevin MacLeod (https://incompetech.com)<br/>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b844ae228b8b991a0b91b35ce8dddebe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["NoahlSeymour"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
