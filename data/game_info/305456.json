{"id": 305456, "slug": "reclamation-itch-joel-marler", "name": "Reclamation (itch) (Joel Marler)", "name_original": "Reclamation (itch) (Joel Marler)", "description": "<p>This game is set approximately 200 years after the collapse of the economy. Most of the world has reverted to feudalism, but one island is re-industrialising under the tutelage of a supercomputer originally built to avert the collapse. This 'kingdom' has received a distress signal from another island assailed by strange forces. The kingdom's agents must uncover where these forces originate from and defeat them so that they can convince the island to become their vassals.</p>\n<p>This is a steampunk RPG. Most communities in this world are neo-medieval, but have preserved relics from the technological age which preceded them. The protagonists' community has redeveloped to roughly our technological level. Although the plot and world is dark, it's also a comedy. It's also the prequel to a book I wrote earlier, 'Rise of the Iron Sun', which is available online for free (https://www.booksie.com/489562-rise-of-the-iron-sun).</p>\n<p>The main game mechanic I use is making all skills be provided by your equipped items, as in a little-known game called Card Quest. Equipping a pistol provides the player several small-arms tactics, for instance; equipping an axe provides more reckless techniques. Once these skills are balanced I'm going to make equipment level up with use and unlock new skills for the player.</p>\n<p>Any feedback and bug reports would be appreciated, and if you want to join the project, let me know!<br/></p><p>CREDITS</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Tanner Helland<br/>Ove Melaa</p>\n<p>Voiceovers:</p>\n<p>Simon Marler (mansion guard, fisherman, Barkstone, Barkstone's son, drunkard, hermit, waiter, senile man)<br/>Frances Marler (outlaw, CEO's receptionist, CEO's wife, bag lady, female farmer, horse<br/>breeder, healed woman)<br/>Oliver Sanders (eastern boss, left-most lumberjack)<br/>Andrew Anderson (eastern guard, barracks soldiers)<br/>Paul Hickman (roof soldier)<br/>Aaliya Nelly (Airi, flashlight girl, liquid emporium girl, beach singer)<br/>Brendan McGorry (Minister Sasaki, mansion ministers, illiterate man, wall guard, outer prison guard, right-most lumberjack)<br/>Kevin McGorry (blacksmith, drunkard's dog, mechanical man, cursed tower door, inner<br/>dungeon guard)<br/>Michael McGorry (weapon trader)<br/>Natalie Miles (Tepid Bath's old woman, logging student, harpy)<br/>Mark Thornton (bard, curator)<br/>Oskar Lottermoser (right-most veteran, duelist, priest, middle lumberjack, sewer mayor's guard, plantation worker)<br/>Tristan Marler (butcher, gambling lumberjack)<br/>Giorgi Meladze (sewer mayor, scientist)<br/>James Shaw (pig man, CEO)</p>\n<p>Plugins:</p>\n<p>Yanfly (SkillCore, InstantCast, AbsorptionBarrier, BattleAICore, BattleBgmControl, BuffsStatesCore, RegionRestrictions, BattleEngineCore, ClassChangeCore, ForceAdvantage, X_AnimatedSVEnemies, X_Subclass, X_VisualHpGauge, X_InBattleStatus, X_TurnOrderDisplay)<br/>Galv (BasicEventShadows, MenuFade, MessageSoundEffects, StationaryTurn, TerrainBattlebacks)<br/>Hime (BattleExpDistribution, BattleWeather, EnemyReinforcements, OverridingStates)<br/>SumRndmDde (AudioFader, BattleBackScroll, MasterVolume, MetronomeSkill, SellShop, SummonCore)<br/>mjshi (Wuxing)<br/>Sasuke Kannazuki (WeaponSkill)<br/>Nilo K.
