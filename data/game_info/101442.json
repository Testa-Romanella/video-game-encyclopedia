IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE FINAL GAME. </strong></p><p><strong>http://store.steampowered.com/app/320140 </strong></p><p><strong>ABSOLUTEDRIFT.COM</strong></p><p>Absolute Drift is a car drifting game. The core mechanic is drifting, which is the driving style of intentionally over-steering so that the car loses traction and starts sliding. The goal is to remain in this state as long as possible, but it takes skill and practice to become a master.</p><p>This demo is a chance to get feedback from players and to see which direction the game can potentially take. Do you like the Drifting Tracks or the Freestyle Tracks more? Are the controls too hard/easy?</p><p>Included in this demo:</p><ul><li>Tutorial level, displayed when first loading up the game.</li><li>3 Freestyle levels, where the goal is to get the max points in 2 minutes.</li><li>2 Track Levels, where the goal is to get max points within 3 laps.</li></ul><p>Check out the Replay System- watch a video of yourself at the end of each level with rewinding, fast forward and slow motion. (Changing cameras has not been implemented for the demo).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb4fee00b6f5666a1f2b4e256887d39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["funselektor"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
