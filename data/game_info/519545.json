You have been called to a tiny secluded town where people's dreams have gone so far out of control that they started affecting real life. Each dream is a puzzle and that's where you can show of your skills and help some people.</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, but it is fully playable. Right now it contains:</p>\n<ul><li>Three unlockable town areas.</li><li>14 dreams to be solved and 15 characters to interact with.</li><li>Many objects in the environment to interact with.</li><li>Dream gallery to ponder about the dreams that have been fixed.</li></ul>\n\n<p>To give some context: I am a professional illustrator in real life and this is a little game I'm making for fun in my free time. I do my best to make this game not suck/ be awesome, but there is only so much a single person can do so I would like to hear your opinions and feedback.\u00a0 People have been very nice so far on other platforms by giving me some good advise and the game has been getting better because of it. Hopefully I can continue improving it. More content and features will keep coming, I have quite a bit planned.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:10:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/108d6a1670d45eb2005c26df5f47067a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ultra Shenanigans"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
