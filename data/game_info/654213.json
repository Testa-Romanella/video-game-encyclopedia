Currently one city state serves as the major commercial hub of the world. That city state being Vacancy, a man-made island built within the East Sea near the coast of west Japan. Originally created as a safe haven for many working migrants quickly became a cesspool with overcrowded buildings and mega-corps taking residence. Many crime syndicates and gangs began to emerge to take control of the streets of Vacancy, which resulted in heightened public security.
