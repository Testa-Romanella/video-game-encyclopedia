Brick breaker games never were so exciting, fun and challenging.\u00a0<br/>The game where you can improve your reaction and creativity. \"Krakout challenge\" is not a simple game where you do not need to think and must wait for random bonuses. Every level covers self bonuses, a self tactic to go through. During the first time, it can be a little bit challenging, but I hope you like challenges and complete all 300 levels and we will see your records on the top of the leaderboard.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>The game has an integrated level editor.
