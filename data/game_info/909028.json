Cyber Shapes is an endless twin-stick shooter where you will clash with a (relatively) wide range of enemy types.</p>\r\nHelpful hints\r\n<p>- The game is playable with mouse &amp; keyboard, as well as a controller. However, it is an aim based game and there was no time to add aim assist or lock on for controller.</p>\n<p>- Use your harvest ability to finish off enemies that are at low health.</p>\n<p>- If they leave a core on the ground, let it grow for a while before you pick it up, you'll get much greater benefit from it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T15:49:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cdc6a0b5037e921a299ee759d65758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["mhorth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
