The fastest player to reach 300 points wins.</p>\n<p>You need to pick up food and bring it back to your plate, and try to stop your opponent from doing the same by throwing food at them! Heavier food is slower to carry but you will get more points! There are also food with status effects, but be careful if you eat these!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Submission for the</strong> Good Eats Food Jam<strong> with the theme \"Buffet\"</strong><br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<strong>X-Box Controller</strong><br/><strong>Keyboard (Player 1)</strong><br/><strong>Keyboard (Player 2)</strong><strong>Move</strong>Left Stick<br/>WASDDirectional Keys<br/><strong>Pick up Food</strong><br/>AENumber Pad 2<strong>Throw /Place Food</strong><br/>XRNumber Pad 3<strong>Eat Food</strong><br/>BQNumber Pad 1<strong>Dash</strong>YSpaceNumber Pad 0\r\n<p>-<br/><br/>Made By:<br/>Ryan Pocock<br/>Jasmin Habezai-Fekri<br/>Janine Janer<br/><br/>Special thanks to Adam Pocock</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1fda4e34de42cfcbb1737ae865728a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["En"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
