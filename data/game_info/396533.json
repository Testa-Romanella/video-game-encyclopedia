When players wake up, an item will appear in the bedroom regarding the dream you just had. The player will need to go through the dreams in order to uncover the story and discover the ending.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The concept of this game came from the idea of Sigmund Freud\u2019s Interpretation of Dream and 'Impossible Space'. A dream is a series of random events, visuals, emotions and perceptions, it is almost impossible to make sense of it. But a dream is generated from the source of our daily life and deep desire. Impossible Space is a space that defies common sense and act against rules of the real world architecturally. The closest path to visualise an impossible space is through dreams.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This game is to introduce the player to a journey of impossible space through a dream that is driven by narrative.</p>\n<p>Spotlight On: Herman Ho, MA Games Design \u2013 LCC Postgraduate Shows 2019<br/></p>\n<p>Trailer:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:59:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5eeedb6cef28bb87c70ab2619a5b17ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HerminatorHo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
