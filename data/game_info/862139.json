The player plays as Octopirate who is looking for lost treasure chests.</p>\n\n<p><em>Move the magnet, collect gold and solve puzzles to get where you need to be!\u00a0And hey, don't go near the garbage, it's no good!</em></p>\n\n<p>This platformer was made by <strong>'Maple Mavericks'</strong>, a team of three Game Development students for our\u00a0<strong>Rapid Prototyping Class. We</strong>\u00a0were presented with a constraint to create a game using the Atari Controller input.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>How to play the game?</strong></p>\n<p>You can enjoy our game with just a keyboard. \u00a0However, do you have an Xbox or the DualShock 4 controller lying around?\u00a0Simply connect them to your computer and you can play the game with them!</p>\n<p>In fact, we recommend playing the game both through a keyboard and a controller to experience the different styles of gameplay they offer.</p>\n<p><em>We are supporting all standard\u00a0keyboards, DualShock 4s and any controllers using XInput.</em></p>\n<p>Benefits of playing with keyboard:</p>\n<p>- Simple and easy to use, with next to no setup required in most cases.</p>\n<p>Benefits of playing with a supported controller:</p>\n<p>- Take advantage of the axis dead zone feature specially designed for controllers to truly experience how the atari controllers felt back in the day.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\r\n<strong>Lead Programmer</strong>: Harsh Koranne\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>(https://www.linkedin.com/in/harsh-koranne/)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager, \u00a0Artist</strong>: Madhur Arora\r\n</p>\n<p>(https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhur-arora-design/)\r\n<br/><br/><strong>Level Designer, \u00a0Animator</strong>: Nicholas John\r\n</p>\n<p>(https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-john-524108173/)</p>\n\n<p>Any feedback on this project is greatly appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T11:41:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03ae1860feefd8986b4e72a771018e31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["hklabs", "Diff", "AccidentalMallu"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
