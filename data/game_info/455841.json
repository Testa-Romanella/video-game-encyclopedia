The week-long period gave us some extra cushion time to discuss, plan, and create the game. Unfortunately some unexpected obstacles occurred for both of us, but we are still proud to have gone as far as we did. Issues arose with AI and texturing.</p>\n<p>- AI: Decided to break mid-development and we didn't know how to rectify it in the time alotted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Texturing:\u00a0Originally the grassy ground textures were only going to be placeholders, but for some reason the track design wasn't functioning correctly. Also, this was Drew's first time having to deal with spliced imagery (in chunks of 256x256 pixels for example). It caused a delay in graphic design so the art could be plugged into the game.</p>\n<p>- There are problems with the gameplay:\u00a0if you drive as soon as the game lets you, the initial jump pad tends to whiff so both spheres land in the spikes. It can be hard getting the pad to launch you over the spikes- try jumping just as you run over the jump pad.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T03:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc17765ea2753ab251f146eb452c754.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrewUniverse"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
