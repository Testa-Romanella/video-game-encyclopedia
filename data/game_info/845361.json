Optionally you can pick up <strong>checkpoints</strong> to teleport to them when ever you want. You can also pick up <strong>stars</strong> that are usually hidden / hard to get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game has <strong>2 endings</strong> depending on if you collected all of the <strong>stars</strong> or not.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the game doesnt have any<strong> saving</strong> mechanics so ragequitting the game will make you replay it from the start again.
