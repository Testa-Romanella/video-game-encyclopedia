What if that contract stated all town residents must use the LeafCorp's phones and computers - but couldn't tell the outside world about it? What if things got weird?</p>\n<p>LeafOS is a mystery game set in Chantilly Valley, USA. The story unfolds through\u00a0\u00a0texts, emails, chats and events. Players change the\u00a0story\u00a0through the choices they make. Gameplay unfolds over the course of January, with the conclusion of the story happening on the 31st day.</p>\n<p>Screenshots provided show placeholders for icons. The battery bar is currently showing in the negative because it's not detecting a phone battery level to display. LeafOS detects both phone battery\u00a0and local time\u00a0as the game hides the notifications bar. A future version for PC is also planned.</p>\n\n<p>Chat can be sped up or slowed down to allow for a quicker play time. Timestamps on chats are done in local time. Players can choose dialogue options, which will affect the story throughout the month.</p>\n<p>Events the player chooses to attend will affect dialogue options and occasional\u00a0story elements. Some events are weekly or monthly, while others will only happen once.</p>\n<p>Chantilly Valley is a fictional town with surreal and supernatural elements. It is a game that mixes narrative gameplay with bite-sized mobile play styles.</p>\n<p>LeafOS is currently in an Alpha state. With the inclusion of texts and emails, it will progress to a Beta state. In Beta, content will need to be created for daily chats (1 day done), texts (not in), emails (not in), and the remaining news articles (almost finished).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T03:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf2/bf2734b7a55affcbc4603bdf3d9e441d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Empathy Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
