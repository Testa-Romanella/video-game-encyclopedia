Build stores and workshops. A certain count of workshops allows longer struts to be used.<br/></p>\n<p>Settlers love sight and hate too much neighbours and noisy workshops around.</p>\n<p>It's just a little demo game, coded within a 4 days jam to proof the concept. Far from being weighted well and many features missing, but have fun to play with physics.<br/></p><p>Tip: <br/>In the demo level, there's a hidden fixed joint on the ground to the right. Build about 10 boxes high, let it fall to the right and stop it with a strut. So it's possible to build a very stable base and high towers,  see screenshots.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83b/83be7e57d254fa8760bac29a4277f9c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joeydee"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
