Climbing the corporate ladder to success.</p>\n<p>Using your innate power to instill fear into humans. Create an efficient, emotionless work machine!</p>\n<p>Navigate different scenarios and maintain balance between profits, ethics and credits!</p>\n<p><strong>**Disclaimer: This game is a prototype/proof of concept. Certain features may be missing, and certain bugs are present**</strong></p>\n<p>Tutorial:</p>\n<p>Space: open stats HUD</p>\n<p>Left mouse button: Click on employees to instill fear into them</p>\n<p>Right mouse button: Click on employees to fire them (once fired, they cannot be returned)</p>\n<p>In Corporate Cthulhu, you need to maintain a certain balance between your company funds,\u00a0 working conditions, and public reputation. These can be seen by pressing space to open your stats HUD.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falling too low on any of these warrants an immediate furlough. Thus, making you restart the game.</p>\n<p>Stats are affected by many things, for example, your worker stat is directly related to how much fear you instill into your employees, doing too much can cause this stat to drop too low. Doing too little will in turn impede your workflow as incompetent workers clog up the daily work quota. So on\u00a0 and so forth.</p>\n<p><strong>**There is no plans to further development on this game as of now**</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T05:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc41a08e39ad1864073783328522f20d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JBroook"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
