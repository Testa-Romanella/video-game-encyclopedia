Melissa the witch knows of a special remedy in the Magic World of the Druids... But a terrible eclipse threatens the inhabitants. What can they do?\"\r\n </p>\n<em>The central concept of Mon Village est Magique  (abbreviated to MVEM) is that the real world is surrounded by multiple,  invisible Magical Worlds. Seb and Tommy travel to some of these places.  They are all connected to a mysterious location called the Infinite  Ocean ...</em>\n<p>A narrative adventure game with a rich story and inventory puzzles,  available in English. Made in a month by The Argonauts during Yaz Jam 2 (2021). \r\n </p>\n<ul><li><strong>Gameplay:</strong> MVEM: A Druidic Adventure is a point and click adventure game in 3rd person view. The  player will go through the story and will have to solve a few puzzles. Despite the cute graphics, it's\u00a0 not necessarily intended to be played by young people, as the game is not that  easy: you'll have to keep clear focus on items and characters, check all dialogues and\u00a0 explore the world. \r\n<br/><br/>Note: The game can be fully played with mouse only (left click is for interactions like use, pick up item, talk. And right click is to look at objects and characters). <br/>You are also given the possibility to move the characters with keyboard, and to switch Seb and Tommy with Space bar (when available in game).<br/><br/>Use F1 to switch between automatic text change or manual text change during dialogues.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Audio:</strong>\r\n The music and\u00a0sound\u00a0effects\u00a0were\u00a0created\u00a0with\u00a0mouth,\u00a0as\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0the theme\u00a0of\u00a0Yaz\u00a0Jam\u00a02.<em> </em><em> </em>\n</li></ul>\n<p> If you liked this short game, please discover the other games created by The Argonauts: <br/>https://the-argonauts.itch.io<br/></p>\n<p>Learn more about the world of Mon Village est Magique and subscribe to the newsletter! https://www.monvillageestmagique.fr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:05:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c15/c15ed91fa0b51386fe6c79e39a287079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Icehouse", "Esmeralda", "The Argonauts"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
