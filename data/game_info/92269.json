Choosing which to equip requires strategic thinking - the way you lay them out is crucial, and some must be sacrificed because cards are also the precious resources you need to heal and use powerful abilities.</p><p>Careful though because baddies can loot you! The cards they steal drop into other players' games. When you defeat an Elite Baddie you'll get another player's card: will you return it or keep it for yourself?</p><p>Either way, prepare for a visit from that player's Holographic Helper to shower you with thanks or terrible vengeance - Loot Rascals is a tale of friendship, loss, and redemption!</p><p>Every game is different in this procedurally generated roguelike: gather Loot Cards, show the Thing Below who's boss, and fly Big Barry to victory!</p>ONLINE INTERACTIONS<p>\r\n\tFor Loot Rascals' online interactions to work you need to sign in so that you can access the server.
