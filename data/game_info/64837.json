It's CCG meets action RPG, combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.A Real-Time Card Game<br/><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.<br/><br/>Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.<br/><br/>Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.A Character-Driven Story<br/>A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge. <br/><br/>The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin. Instead, they brought monsters.<br/><br/><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns. Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, <strong>The Land of Glass</strong> tells stories that are both personal and small\u2014it is a character study first and an epic fantasy second.<br/><br/>Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.Key Features<br/><ul><li>    Four campaigns with eight different characters<br/></li><li>    A unique take on deck-based card games<br/></li><li>    Character driven story<br/></li><li>    Nine different types of magic<br/></li><li>    Hundreds of cards to collect<br/></li><li>    In-depth crafting system<br/></li><li>    Stained glass art style</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ab/0abd58f7ad4a1cd16dcfcec6b1ea1460.jpg", "website": "http://www.dualwieldsoftware.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 8}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 265, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dual Wield Software"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dual Wield Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
