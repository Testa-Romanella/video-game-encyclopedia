Be careful though, something lurks in the light. Find dark cells to hide from a mysterious shadow creature. Sometimes it's best to be left in the dark.</p>\n<p>This is a game that I've wanted to make for a while. The original concept was in 2D, but I decided to try to make it in 3D. This is a prototype for a potential full game in the future. If you like the concept, let me know in the comments below. If you don't like it, let me know in the comments below.
