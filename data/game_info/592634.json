This was the result. This was fun to make and I even learned a thing or two while making it. This game is great if you want to kill some time with a friend while you're waiting around to do something else. If like me, you have no friends to play it with, you can always play it by yourself by controlling both platforms.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The cube spawns in the centre of the game and will move in a random direction. You must stop the cube from going into your barrier. If the cube does go into your barrier, your opponent will gain 1 point. The more points you have, the better.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move the left player with the W and S keys<br/>Move the right player with the Up and Down Arrow keys<br/>If the ball or platforms bug use the \"R\" key to reset the scene (scores are not reset)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:24:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbf/dbfb64c742f544c781656a31a44d936e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["actuallyKron"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
