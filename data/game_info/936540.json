You can't eat curses while the laser is going, but you can blast 'em.</li></ul>\n<p>Made in 72 hours for Minijam 127:\u00a0 \"Cats\", with a color pallet limitation. I wasn't *required* to stick to the pallet, but I\u00a0did anyway. I didn't really utilize the greys of the pallet, and I would probably add another darker color to spice up the background. This was a very relaxed jam, I worked well within my comfort zone. Interesting movement controls, and good visual feedback I think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T05:59:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/424326e6535813de68c40f9c9ffd3d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Inkspinner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
