It's a fast paced game where you have to mix and match colors to gain points! Here's how to play the game if you're confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play the game</strong></p>\n<p>In the game, there is a help menu but here's another explanation incase that wasn't clear enough.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of the game, you are a red square on the left. With W, S or the up arrow key and the down arrow key, you can control your character. Enemies randomly spawn from the right and you must match your color. For example, if you're red, you must touch the red enemy in order to become a new random color. You again, match the colors. As far as the points system goes, it's fairly easy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>+15 points for matching</p>\n<p>-50 points for mismatching (Touching a wrong color)</p>\n\n<p>Also, there are \"levels\" in this game. Basically, after every 50 points you get, you get onto the next level or difficulty,\u00a0 and more enemies spawn and faster. It gets super fast paced and exciting, so have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:11:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1a/a1aeee7d3ca17e618f7e93a34e6c7663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Arj783"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
