In this fast-paced simple game, you'll take on the role of a sphere, racing through a level filled with deadly cubes that threaten to block your path at every move.</p>\n<p>As you journey through each level, you'll need to use your fast reflexes to dodge and weave around the cubes, rolling with precision to avoid being caught. With each passing level, the speed will increase so watch out, pushing you to the limit!</p>\n\n<p>This is my First Unity Game! Thank you for playing, and hopefully I\u00a0can create more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50c/50c862c1f0ceda30d27d87a39893fca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kurtzeus22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
