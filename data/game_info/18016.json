{"id": 18016, "slug": "multiscreens", "name": "Multiscreens", "name_original": "Multiscreens", "description": "Multiscreens is a early-access program that lets you have as many screens as you want in VR. Specifically, each program is its own screen and can be moved around as desired.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRight now you can:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Change the target framerate of each window captured<br/>\r\n- Play multiple videos simultaneously (just make sure if you are in chrome to disable Hardware Acceleration in advanced settings) while playing a game<br/>\r\n- Turn on supersampling<br/>\r\n- Control everything with your mouse which leaves your keyboard and controller free for typical use (there is also a mouse sensitivity setting)<br/>\r\n- Move windows freely in a 3D space around you and make them bigger or smaller as desired<br/>\r\n- Capture right click menus and other context menus<br/>\r\n- Capture the mouse on the currently active window<br/>\r\n- No Headless Ghosts are required, this program works fine when you simply have a single physical monitor (or headless ghost) plugged in<br/>\r\n- Minimize (hide) windows as desired<br/>\r\n- Change focus between windows with a single click<br/>\r\n- Use a webcam that's displayed below you to see your keyboard while in VR<br/>\r\n- Multiscreens can technically capture every window, but some it can only capture while they are currently focused<br/>\r\n- There is a &amp;quot;virtual taskbar&amp;quot; that allows you to bring up programs you have opened by clicking on their icons below<br/>\r\n- You can change this Taskbar's position<br/>\r\n- Reset view<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrent limitations (in order of planned feature addition):<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Screens can't be curved yet<br/>\r\n- You generally need to open windows before opening Multiscreens, it's difficult to start programs while in Multiscreens (I'm going to add a search bar to open any program you currently have installed and allow you to &amp;quot;pin&amp;quot; programs to your taskbar)<br/>\r\n- Can't capture the entire desktop<br/>\r\n- Vive controller support doesn't exist yet, everything is currently controlled with your mouse<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnjoy, and let me know what you think! I'm happy to listen to feedback and will try and make this the best product for all of you as possible :)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/889/889d977c83468c923f66db82fc160c9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phylliida"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Phylliida"], "esrb_rating": null}
