The great flames Arr, Jii, and Bii have been misplaced, and it's up to you\u00a0to return them to the temple and restore color.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay is that of your typical 2D platformer. You can jump, double jump, walljump, you get the point. But to spice it up a little bit, you can also reverse gravity to walk on the ceiling!\u00a0As you recover the flames, the world gradually regains its color.</p>\n<p>I made this game over\u00a0about a month for my final art project, and I'm pretty happy with the results! As a fair warning, though, it's very short and there are still loose ends. I\u00a0may or may not continue working on this game, but it felt great to create something new after working on LMATSOH for so long (still working on it...)</p>\n<p>CONTROLS (not rebindable yet, sorry!):<br/></p>\n<p>ARROWS - move</p>\n<p>SHIFT - sprint<br/></p>\n<p>Z - jump / double jump</p>\n<p>SPACE:\u00a0reverse gravity</p>\n<p>WASD - pan camera</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T05:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d51eb9b5a7f09d299fc8f0749f513fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BurlapTheMonkey"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
