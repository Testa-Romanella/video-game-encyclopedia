The theme was [genre] without [mechanic]. So we made a platforming game in which the character doing all the platforming isn't controlled by the player. Instead, you control a separate character, shooting things that help get the platforming character to the end of the level. In this sense it's also technically a top-down shooter without vertical scrolling, but it's mainly about the platforming!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Art &amp; Concept:\u00a0Kyle Labriola</li><li>Code &amp; Design: Alex Rosetti</li><li>Music: Alex Rosetti &amp; Marina Khatin</li></ul>\n<p>Tools Used:</p>\n<ul><li>Construct 3 (game engine)</li><li>Adobe Flash (graphics)</li><li>Clip Studio Paint (title graphic)</li><li>REAPER (music)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c2/2c27673defea25ffb533ae9e2e179e26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Rosetti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
