It is often cited as one of the earliest examples of a Metroidvania style game and featured \"realistic gravity, inertia and object mass years before players understood the concept of a physics engine... an astounding level of AI, stealth-based gameplay, a logical ecosystem governing the world's creatures and a teleportation mechanic that feels startlingly like a predecessor to Portal\" .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34a84b026243d18185bdd084306f2cc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 413, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "PC", "Commodore / Amiga", "Genesis"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Superior Software", "Audiogenic"], "esrb_rating": null}
