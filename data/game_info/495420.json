Hardware components were made out of real hang-glider parts. The software was developed specifically for this purpose because existing generic flight simulators do not simulate weight-shift controlled aircraft accurately enough. Therefore, custom aerodynamics and rigid body setup were developed in Unreal Engine 4. To our knowledge this makes it the only simulator of its kind in the world.</p>\n<p>Current simulator design enables VR experience in both the sitting and the full hang-glider rig setup with multiple realism options. It can also be run as a standard desktop flight simulation. Future plans include spectator mode for training and real-time flight analysis, multiplayer for group soaring exercises, higher realism in thermals simulation and rendering, and much much much more\u2026</p>\n<p>VR variant will soon be\u00a0available via Patreon tiers (see \"More information\" for the link to Patreon page).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T06:06:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d04e6af951e67d536d8582c2af8a1fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aileron"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
