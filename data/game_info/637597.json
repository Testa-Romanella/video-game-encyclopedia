{"id": 637597, "slug": "edgewalker", "name": "Edgewalker", "name_original": "Edgewalker", "description": "<p>\u201cEdgewalker\u201d is a puzzle-platformer where you are tasked with surviving at the end of the world. Each step you take destroys whatever is left, one piece at a time \u2013 can you map the optimal path and make it to your destination? The game was a solo project made in one week for the \u201cGames Jobs Live 2021\u201d game jam. <br/></p>\n<p>The Game Jam theme was \"One Time Use\" and, as such, the entire game map can only be \"used once\". Once you step off a tile, it disappears, forever consumed by the encroaching void. Gather information, find items and objectives, then use what you have learned between playthroughs to map out the perfect path.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Features:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>4 Alternate endings \u2013 <em>How will you survive the end of the world?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Fully destructible environment \u2013<em> In this game, the entire world is one-time use. Watch as the terrain fades away with every step you take.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Collectible Items \u2013 <em>Collect items to unlock different endings, or use them to make new ones or access areas otherwise inaccessible.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Void Powers \u2013 <em>As the world disappears, your character will gain new abilities, which will let you better traverse the ruined landscape.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use WSAD or the arrow keys to move and use your mouse to look around. You can sprint using the SHIFT key and crouch using the CTRL key. Hold the TAB key to view the map and hold the B key to view your inventory. Controls are visible in-game. </p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Solo Developer \u2013 Matt Way\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Uses the following assets:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Free 3D Assets by Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/) \r\n  </p>\n<p>Free Game Icons by Lorc and Delapouite (https://game-icons.net/) \r\n  </p>\n<p>Mini First Person Controller by Vitefait (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/mini-first-person-controller-174710) \r\n  </p>\n<p>Music by Revolution Void (https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Revolution_Void) \r\n  </p>\n<p>Galaxy Materials by SineVFX (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/galaxy-materials-191773)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Polygon Town Pack by Synty Studios (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/polygon-town-pack-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-121115) \r\n  \r\n  <br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T03:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b06633abbfa38c2962b85eaa9dc2ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattWay"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
