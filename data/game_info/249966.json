{"id": 249966, "slug": "spider-man-2000", "name": "Spider-Man (2000)", "name_original": "Spider-Man (2000)", "description": "<p>Spider-Man is an action-adventure video game based on the Marvel Comics comic book series The Amazing Spider-Man, which features the fictional superhero Spider-Man. Although it features the likenesses and same voice actors, it is not based on the animated television shows from the 1990s. It was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision using the Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater game engine for the PlayStation in 2000; the game was later ported by different developers to various systems including the Game Boy Color and Nintendo 64 that same year, as well as the Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows in 2001. The game follows Spider-Man as he is framed by a doppleganger for stealing a device created by a supposedly reformed Dr. Otto Octavious. The game features Venom, Carnage, Scorpion, Rhino, Mysterio and an exclusive-to-game Symbiote Doctor Octopus all as boss battles. Two direct sequels were released in 2001; one developed by Torus Games, Spider-Man 2: The Sinister Six, released for the Game Boy Color, and one developed by Vicarious Visions, Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro, released exclusively for the PlayStation. This game and its latter sequel feature narration from Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2000-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T03:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1cf/1cf9e301f1d27172546dcabc2f6cb597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.3, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 150, "beaten": 418, "toplay": 30, "dropped": 117, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 376, "suggestions_count": 385, "game_series_count": 33, "reviews_count": 382, "platforms": ["Dreamcast", "Nintendo 64", "PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Vicarious Visions", "Edge of Reality", "Neversoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Activision Value Publishing"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
