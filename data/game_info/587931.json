Across the land, the triumphs and tragedies of all, mighty and meagre, are determined by the roll of the dice. One moment, a novice thief might pick the world's most sophisticated lock with an old twig; the next, a beloved king might roll a critical failure on dexterity while attending a banquet, with spectacular results.</p>\n<p>Clad in steel, a nameless champion embarks upon a journey to put a stop to this. His destination: the mountain's summit, where sits the dicemaster whose cruel whims have set the world atumble. In his hand are three of the Dice of Destiny; the other four must be prised from the hands of the foul Lich.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Code by <strong>JestemStefan</strong><br/>Art by <strong>D4yz</strong><br/>UI by <strong>Vela</strong><br/>Sound Design by <strong>Romeromey</strong><br/>Music by <strong>JohnGabrielUK</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dice of Destiny</em> was made for the thirty-second Godot Wild Jam.<br/>The soundtrack is available on Bandcamp.<br/></p>\n<p>P.S.
