In this game, you play as an amusing briefcase throughout the inspired scenario of Recife and Olinda, two big cities from the northeast of Brazil. Your objective is to go as\u00a0further as you can, collecting pages along the way in order to buy upgrades. Be careful with the obstacles as you will die if hit them in the front, instead you should bounce on top of them to keep going and\u00a0make combos.</p>\n<p>Game Designer -\u00a0https://lilshopa.itch.io</p>\n<p>Programmer: https://leniton.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Sound Designer: https://zalvin.itch.io<br/></p><p>Artist:\u00a0https://alexandre-sampaio.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T00:07:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/828/8287804b610b33031cb6a8cda3177568.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Leniton", "Marcos Vinicius", "Alexandre Sampaio", "\u00c1lvaro Lu\u00eds"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
