Much of it is sort of advanced knowledge that you don't need to know before playing.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Note: There are some timing issues with the WebGL version; download the Windows build for a smoother experience.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>--</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The King's Gambit was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, where the theme was \"Roll  of the Dice\". I interpreted that as taking risky actions with the hope  that it will produce a good outcome. In mechanical terms, you sacrifice  your limited number of armies against unbeatable foes with the hope that  you'll find the Overmind as a result.</p>\n<p>You control a number of outclassed armies, trying to survive against  the Gelshari invasion. One of your armies fighting one of theirs spells  certain death.      </p>\n<p>However, you have one hope. The stolen Gelshari Flames can empower  one of your armies, giving them a chance. What's more, the Overmind  hiding amongst the enemy acts as a lifeline for the Gelshari: if you can  find and destroy it, victory is assured.  \r\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Full instructions and controls are in the game itself, but everything is controllable with a mouse; drag and drop your armies to green zones to move them.<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Made with Unity, Piskel, Audacity, Beepbox. I made most of the content during the jam itself, though the music is a song I made a while back.</p><p>I used this palette for the art: https://lospec.com/palette-list/oil-6<br/></p>\n<p>Everything created by me, Jaco van Hemert.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T23:22:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/516/51637c66eb695d1f67df885d3ee8c1fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jaco van Hemert"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
