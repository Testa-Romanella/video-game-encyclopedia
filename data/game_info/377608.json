{"id": 377608, "slug": "xuan-omega-the-demo", "name": "Xuan Omega (The Demo)", "name_original": "Xuan Omega (The Demo)", "description": "<p><strong>WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?</strong></p>\n<p>A twisted JRPG with a knack for unpredictability, chaos, and suffering...ALL through the lens of a young orphan named Xuan. With no other feasible options in sight, Xuan has joined a gang that is based around his orphanage, and is forced to start a new life amongst his unlikely peers.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?</strong></p>\n<p>To me, the most impressionable and powerful forms of content have a knack for peculiarity, and can evoke REAL\u00a0emotion. I long to create a world that can throw curveballs of all forms at the player in hopes of constructing a true EXPERIENCE, rather than just a game that is played for sake of itself. The choice to create a JRPG is a testament to my blissful\u00a0childhood, which was littered with tons of\u00a0GBA games and cartoons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UNCERTAINTY</strong></p>\n<p>Xuan exists in a world that is untamed and full of surprises. The common man wouldn't be wise to venture around without protection, let alone a young child with no supervision. While the path or objective may be clear to a certain extent, Xuan is able to become sidetracked VERY easily within the world due to the proclivity of the inhabitants...some of which include:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DERANGED SOCIOPATHS</em></strong>\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PSYCHOTIC KIDNAPPERS\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>TRUE BLOOD WAR VETERANS</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>When a world is littered with nothing but garbage, joining a gang might not be such a bad idea. Xuan certainly doesn't think so...and it shows. Xuan is not an angel himself. Battling enemies will grant Xuan higher statistics, more skills, and can even recruit party members along his journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SUFFERING</strong></p>\n<p>Xuan's slippery predicament is reflected in all facets of the world. Striving to improve and potentially fix his life is seemingly impossible considering the constant appearance of blood, death, and suffering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Games tend to be glossed over with falsehoods of perfection and glee. I am striving to create a counterpoint, one that can show the player the uglier side of reality. Xuan has no choice but to acknowledge this truth...whether he chooses to harmonize with it is completely up to him.</p>\n\n\n<p>Although the game is still in its preliminary stage, humble strides for the future have been plotted. Here is a list of features and mini projects\u00a0that I plan to pursue:</p>\n<p><em>- Vinyl Soundtrack Release (roughly 100 tracks in length, includes\u00a0bonus tracks)</em></p>\n<p><em>- Animated Battlebacks (rather than X &amp; Y movement)</em></p>\n<p><em>- Shirts &amp; Stickers</em></p>\n<p><em>- DLC Spin Offs/Sequels (contingent on initial reception)</em></p>\n<p><em>- Comic Series</em></p>\n<p><em>- MORE Recruitable Characters</em></p>\n<p><em>- MORE Items</em></p>\n<p><em>- MORE Moves</em></p>\n<p><em>- MORE.......everything.</em></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Shift --&gt; Sprint</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys --&gt; Movement</p>\n<p>Esc --&gt; Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:16:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06a67b0c2655d61a8dd71b7448e1ec21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["2eachisown"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
