Press Backspace to restart and Escape to exit. Please use a controller because using a mouse can cause the ball to fall through the floor. Made following a GameDev.TV blueprint tutorial series. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Just the one level but comment below if you'd be interested in playing this as a full game with more complicated mazes with obstacles or if you have any ideas for how to improve it.
