The Player has to venture away from home and into the darkness to gather resources -- wood, vines, and crystals -- to craft light beacons to forestall the darkness. Meanwhile, as the player crafts and places more beacons around the map, corrupted animals spawn from the darkness and try to destroy the beacons and kill the venturing family members.</p>\n<p>Eventually, as the darkness encircles the house and the corrupted animals become more numerous, the player succumbs to the ever present darkness and, hopefully, tries again to last longer on their next playthrough.</p>\n\n\n<p>Made in Unity for Global Game Jam 2019 (theme:\u00a0\"What home means to you\").</p>\n<p>Diversifiers:</p>\n<ul><li>Language-Independence (Sponsored by Valve Software)</li><li>Celestial</li><li>Keep it simple</li><li>Meanwhile</li></ul>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Chris Macholtz</strong>:\u00a0Programming</p>\n<p><strong>Jade Marmorstein</strong>:\u00a0Art</p>\n<p><strong>Paul Rogers</strong>:\u00a0Sound Design, Writing</p>\n<p><strong>Jonah Venglarcik</strong>:\u00a0UI Art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tim Williams</strong>: Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T15:39:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cf/5cf55cf32aa0452db65ef9741ae10821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sakohju", "Smumbo", "Dailaryo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
