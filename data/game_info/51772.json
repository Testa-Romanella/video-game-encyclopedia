{"id": 51772, "slug": "executive-hockey", "name": "Executive Hockey", "name_original": "Executive Hockey", "description": "Rally Call Software presents Executive Hockey, a brand new hockey management sim. Pick a team with a philosophy that appeals to you -- offense, defense, toughness, and more -- and sign players, trade players, ice your best lineups and go all in against 30 other teams for the Gretzky Cup. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe trade deadline is 5 days away. Your best center will be out six weeks or more, and your team is on the playoff bubble. Do you double down and pick up some more help in the middle, or do you pack it in for the year and try to get something for assets that are about to become free agents? The choice is yours. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPut playmakers and snipers together on a line for an added offensive bonus. Pick a franchise known for its toughness and load your team with grinders, pests and enforcers and draw more penalties. Get the first overall draft pick and grab the hotshot young generational player that's will be the cornerstone of your team for years to come. Put weaker players in the lineup more and watch them improve with the extra ice time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711c3abd5bdfa9eca805d685067e59ae.jpg", "website": "http://www.rallycallsoftware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rally Call Software"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Rally Call Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
