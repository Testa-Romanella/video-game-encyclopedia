Because it&#39;s a true 1997 classic video game! Unfortunately, when the game was over, it went unnoticed, largely because it didn&#39;t have an appropriate distribution. Luckily it has been rescued, adapted to work correctly in current operating systems and some small bugs have been corrected.</p>\n<p>We really hope you have a good time playing it and remember the old days! And if you can do it in company... Better than better! Of course, you will have to do it locally, with the same computer and seeing them faces. As we did before!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T18:01:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b9608a823ab6bf951a7c124978e7a76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frankenstein Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sinnesloschen"], "esrb_rating": null}
