In the end, I probably spent about 6-8 hours creating te game (with a lot of youtube/stackoverflow/discord in between).</p>\n<p>Music and sfx were generated by an auto-generator.\u00a0 Font is from a free font by GrafxKid (itch.io)</p>\n<p>Only available for Windows - Sorry, though if you have linux or mac and python/pygame installed, you should be able to run the Dimensions.py directly.</p>\n<p>I'm really bad at playing games, so my max score so far is only 63. Let me know what you get up to :)</p>\n<p>Thanks for commenting/voting on the game or source code.
