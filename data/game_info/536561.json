The Boy has since developed retrograde amnesia. Search deep inside The Boy\u2019s subconscious to discover what has happened to The Boy.</p>\n<p>Doors focuses around domestic family violence and introduces these ideas through cartoon imagery, for example The Boy\u2019s recollection of a violent incident is currently a BBQ with a red colour.
