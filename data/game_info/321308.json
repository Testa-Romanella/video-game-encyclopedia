Jump, shoot, collect. Sounds banal?<br/><br/><ul><li> As long as you step on something, you won't fall. Don't fall.<br/></li><li> The more momentum you have, the higher and longer you jump.<br/></li><li> Increase your momentum by jumping consecutively or moving diagonally. Or maybe doing both... why not?<br/></li><li> Point of those stars which you have to collect is to force you maneuver in specific ways. You get no score, only pain.<br/></li><li> Enemy bullets don't kill you directly. They just explode and make you fly. If you're lucky enough, you won't fall.<br/></li><li> Enjoy the hand-drawn world. And don't fall. If you do, press R to restart immediately.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a3/8a3c41b50041e1c74e7c5e9122917bbb.jpg", "website": "https://anatolian.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["M\u00f6f Selvi"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anatolian ODS"], "esrb_rating": null}
