Player start's as a red spaceship and his/her's mission is simple, to survive. There are waves of enemies that player must overcome with his/her's laser weapons. Once in a while a Boss spawns and than the fun begins. There are level trackers and score trackers in top corners so you are always updated how far you made it. Team on this project was compound of only 2 people - me (visuals and a bit of unity + my uncle M. Machat as my technical consultant and support).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game it self is nothing much, but as I said earlier, its working. :D Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66a97731cdebb173d7017e3716ca510a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vojt\u011bch \"Voittt\" Novotn\u00fd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
