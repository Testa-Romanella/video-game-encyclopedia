You hear a Voice in your head. The Voice asks you for help to get out of trash cluster. It promises to teach you how to survive in this place and to upload yourself in a new robotic body. Have you become a machine soul? No, you are pretty sure that you're still sitting in front of your home computer. But where did this Voice come from? And why do you think that you were someone else before? The place is teeming with dangerous creatures, so make your step careful. And don't anger the Voice. He is your only friend after all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T05:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9e3f4dedeac42d34dcc7bc6b0e5da12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zellibon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
