Priyte noticed he has 3 diamonds shards in total, but there was 9 more out there. If they don't get the rest of the shards before Professor Kogon gets them, then the world would be conquered by the evil pirate crew and the professor himself. Hyper figures they could resurrect an old pirate crew that was good in the past and use them to their advantage against Professor Kogon.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>-CONTROLS-</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Title Screen/Options - Arrow keys to navigate the menu, press space on an option to proceed.\r\n</p>\n<p>Main Game - Right or left arrows to move either direction &amp; Z key to jump.\r\n</p>\n<p>GAMEPAD CONTROLLERS ARE SUPPORTED!
