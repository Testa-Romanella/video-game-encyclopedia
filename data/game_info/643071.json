She needs to constantly eat or she'll expire in a minute \ud83d\ude32. Kiki, being a caring (if irresponsible) friend, has lured a small band of adventurers into their home dungeon in the hopes of separating them from their gold for Mimi.<br/></p>\n<p> Why they didn't just go to see a Monster Cleric is anyone's guess.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Characters-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Kiki Kobold </strong>- Kiki might have four left feet, tripping over herself more than it seems possible. Despite this, she has never had a notable injury.<br/><strong>Mimi\u00a0Mimic\u00a0</strong>- Mimi says it's mean to eat people. Their money tastes better on its own anyway.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Richard the Tin Can </strong>- Nobody knows if there is a man, beast or anything at all beneath that suit of armour. They seem to prefer it that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Nyala the Meowstical </strong>- A maven of the magic missile, many have wondered if the witch had ever learned another spell. When asked about it, she likes to quote Bruce Lee; \"be like water\" she'll say. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>-Controls-<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Keyboard and Mouse :</em><br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>[W][A][S][D] -</strong> Move</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse\u00a0</strong>- Aim Dash<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Hold Left </strong><strong>Mouse\u00a0Button\u00a0</strong>- Charge Dash</p>\n<p><strong>Release Left </strong><strong>Mouse\u00a0Button\u00a0</strong>- Dash</p>\n<p><strong><em>Gamepad :</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Left Stick -</strong> Move\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Right Stick </strong>- Aim Dash\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hold Right Trigger</strong><strong> </strong>- Charge Dash <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Release Right Trigger</strong> - Dash<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>- TEAM -</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Character Design, Art and</strong> <strong>Programming\u00a0 by KassieKitsune, Greedy Eve and SleepyLil - @LanFanHasA (Twitter) </strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Music and Sounds by Olivia Renee Soules - @Olipolygon(Twitter)- Bandcamp</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T10:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc32e69b9d384995e7f412bf1bbd53c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Philosopher's Stone System"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
