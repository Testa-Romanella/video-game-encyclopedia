{"id": 90359, "slug": "scooby-horror", "name": "Scooby Horror", "name_original": "Scooby Horror", "description": "<p>Scooby Doo is missing. No one knows for sure where he is, but they've got a clue. \u00a0He's been kidnapped by a group of ghosts\u00a0in glowing diving suits, hiding in the woods near a lake. They've probably got Scooby Doo. Who the hell knows what they've been doing to Scooby.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Gameplay: This is a short horror game where you play as Shaggy, looking for Scooby Doo (he's trapped in a cage btw), in the woods at night, cause why not. You must find Scooby and get out before they catch you. Scooby Doo is always in a random place each time you play, so if you find him in a building, next time you play, he'll probably be in the mines.</p>\n<p>Inspired by: Slendy Tubbies and I guess Slender as well.</p>\n<p>Notes: I wanted to make the enemy the Diver from the Scooby Doo episode: A Clue For Scooby Doo (1969) and wanted to make the game spooky too I suppose. I always wanted to play a 3D Scooby Doo horror game where the enemy wasn't some dude in a monster costume but an actual ghost. I hate the new Scooby Doo shows, they're all shit. I only go back and watch the old 60s Scooby Doo sometimes cause I found it more entertaining, it gave me Scooby Doo horror game ideas and brings back fond memories of years ago when I'd watch Scooby Doo on Boomerang, in the morning.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this game and have as much fun playing it as I did making it.</p>\n<p>Got any ideas for updates? Let me know, and I'll gladly add it if I'm able to. Also contact me if you make a gameplay vid about my game. I'd love to know.</p>\n<p>Created by: Dave Microwaves Games</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e32/e32d6be0dde46ae3897db84c88804f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
