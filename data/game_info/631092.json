But each time you hit a brick it will expand and increase its point value. And if there is no more room to expand, the brick will break. So the key for high scores is to let some bricks grow without breaking them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b79767c2d5ba05558cf50769e64bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
