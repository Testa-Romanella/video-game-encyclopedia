Taiwan will start attacking mainland ports and airfields with cruise missiles, which will eventually cripple China\u2019s economy and war effort.\u00a0 Taiwanese scientists will also be hard at work on building nuclear weapons.\u00a0 The game assumes that ROC forces are incapable of maneuvering for the first four days of the conflict due to PRC air superiority and the destruction of key command and control infrastructure.\u00a0 Taiwanese army reservists will also start to reinforce ROC defenses.\u00a0 You need to win fast.\u00a0 Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c118cede3ef441abac280c2b4a27ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["africacrossgames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
