In Space! That's right, \r\n\t<strong><em>THE</em></strong> Outer Space!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWith this new employment opportunity, expect to:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Shoot fast from your cozy ship (shoot too much &amp; you're fired though)</li>\n<li>Warp around short distances to get to where you need to be</li>\n<li>Not explode!</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tBONUS FEATURE FOR SUPER PLAYERS: there is a pause function!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSPECIAL TIP: to really get into the action, start Infinite mode at 1.2 seconds between spawns. Quite fun, if I do say so myself.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><em>(As for the actual gameplay, think of it like action Tetris. Junk flies at you, you shoot it, repeat. Add speed for infinite mode, add strategy(?) for levels mode.)</em></strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnyways, seriously for a moment - this is my first full video game. Donezo, maybe an update. But don't put too much stake in that. But do expect my gratitude for trying it out - thank you so, so much for checking this out.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIf you have any comments, please feel free to leave them. I'd love to hear any suggestions and if the game actually works for anyone else. Thank you.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33a/33ac18901c16f32d474e75d88a8ff367.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedShard"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
