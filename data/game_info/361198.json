However, the place is filled with guards and you\u00a0will need to plan your steps carefully to fool them.</p>\n<p>You can walk with the arrow keys and you can interact with the passes and doors by \"walking\" into them. An icon in the top-left corner shows what pass you have at the moment.</p>\n<p>This game is a submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2019.\u00a0The theme is \"only one\", which gave birth to the idea that\u00a0you can only carry one pass at a time\u00a0to show to the guards.</p>\n<p>I would have liked\u00a0to design more levels and explore more ideas, but I run out of time. I hope you\u00a0like\u00a0the core idea behind the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e5/1e53dcfc4d5025344d106c56e08940ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yordrar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
