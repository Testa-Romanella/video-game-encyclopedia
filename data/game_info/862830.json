I took the time of the jam to also polish the engine and add countless new features (I\u2019ve made 40 new commits to the engine\u2019s source code since the jam started\u2026 LOL). So it was extra hard for me to manage to make the game and the art for it during this tight time period. I apologize for the extra simplicity of it, but I hope you understand the reasons. :)\r\n</p>\r\nLearn More!\r\n<p>If you are curious about the Game Engine (Cave), feel free to join our discord server to talk about it and also test the engine!
