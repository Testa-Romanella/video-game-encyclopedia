Some plants, like vines and forget-me-nots uncover more parts of the level for you to explore.\u00a0 Can you get 100% completion in every level?</p>\n<p>This game is an entry for the\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 #GreatSpringGameJam2021. Originally, I was going to spend more time on this game, which would've allowed me to add more levels and special flowers, however my exams got in the way and I ended up being a lot busier than I anticipated. I still think this game turned out fairly nicely, though.</p>\n<p>If you're interested, you can check out the game's source code as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/768/76857e184e933e8f003e1c5c91b4ea8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ellpeck"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
