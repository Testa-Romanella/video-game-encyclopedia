It is a prototype that is currently being developed by a small team of Swedish students.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTamarrion takes place in a fantasy world that has been peaceful for centuries, but with an ancient evil awakening again the gods must call on a champion. Tamarrion must alone face enormous boss monsters that no other human could match.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tKeyboard and Mouse controlled.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This demo is an early prototype meant to test the controls and spell systems</em>\n</p>\r\nFeatures\r\nBoss fighting\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe main goal of the game is to fight against enormous boss monsters. At the moment we have one boss fight implemented and we are working on adding several more. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\r\nSpells\r\n<p>\r\n\tUtilize the spells available to suit your own play style (there are many more being planned for). The spell system is skill shot based, giving the player more control and an increased challenge.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\r\nGod Powers\r\n<p>\r\n\tBy using spells you can call upon the gods to unleash powerful special abilities to aid you in battle.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nPlay It!\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe game is a PC compatible prototype that is played with a mouse and keyboard.
