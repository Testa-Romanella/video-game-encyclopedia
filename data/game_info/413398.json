We interview people, who feel discriminated and who discriminate, or whose mind is far beyond the mentality of discrimination. We try to portrait discrimination back into his mortal face.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In this documentary game, not like by a documentary film, occurs all the interviews in parallel. The players don\u2019t have to feel imposed to hear or understand. It appears at first in form of an enjoyable walk simulation and RPG with fantasy creatures, each of which was designed for our interviewees based on their self-imagination. If the players show their interest and empathy, they will enter the personal story. Through their own effort, they may esteem more what they hear, and receive in exchange the compassion, strength or a chance for reflection.</p>\n\n<p>play:</p>\n<p>click to get to the point</p>\n<p>put mouse on the side to look around</p>\n<p>press esc to exit on windows, press space to exit on mac</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10f4744f429a77bd9f1cc08e96493ee2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ghbvftyjn"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
