But the front-most cube at the top layer completely covers the back-most cube of the bottom layer. There's no way to easily access them via mouse-pointer, short of rotating the cube. This also explains why the control area's top and bottom layers were split away from each other. See the image below :(</p>\n<p>(If you have a solution or preferred other way of controlling the blocks, please feel free to comment!)<br/></p>\n\r\nThe isometric view hiding one of the blocks at the bottom layer\r\n<p><strong>Q: The game says my answer is wrong, but I'm sure it's right.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Oops!
