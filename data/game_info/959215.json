Where one bets their life for great power and wealth. When the doors slam shut it is do or die.</p>\n<p>Made with Godot with aseprite made</p>\n<p>Hedged bet is a simple roguelike built around a loop much like diablo and diablo 2. Go into the dungeon and retreat to heal up and gain new gear.</p>\n<p>Glyphs will appear perioidicly in the dungeon and return you to the surface. There are stair cases that open depending how far you go into the dungeon. Your weapon quality you get per trip back is based on the amount of sin collected which is picked up off of enemies and returning from deeper glpyhs.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move around. Bump into a wall to skip a turn.</p>\n<p>Enter to pick up, confirm swap, and activate glyphs to return to the surface.</p>\n<p>Gameplay hints.</p>\n<p>Bump little hat to get a free collection of items.</p>\n<p>Every return trip you can bump little hat once for 5 random items. The power of items will increase the further you go down. The quality of the items will increase with more sin you bring from the depths.</p>\n<p>Equipment is key, the monsters are stronger as you go down. Return often and try and keep in a relative range of leveled items only just behind where you are in the dungeon, rarer items have a better punch and allow you go longer without an upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>developer note</p>\n<p>first round with godot on this scale was rough. Godot is interesting and has some pitfalls but can be managed well enough. This had a lot of scraped ideas such as modifying how the weapon \"gacha\" would function. Potions were going to be introduced but scraped as balancing became an issue. IT still wasn't entirely fixed but game is beatable and oscillate between hard and joke depending how brave you get.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T23:31:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/323285eb8e6b47cdebc47b871bcb7ead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["badscribbler"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
