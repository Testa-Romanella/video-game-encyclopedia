Although they are all low poly models, they still use <strong>Nanite</strong> and <strong>Lumen</strong>. This is an attempt to new technology, but it also brings some computer hardware requirements. Because it is a low-mode model, it doesn't matter whether your computer supports Nanite or not. The key is Lumen's requirement: a graphics card that supports DirectX 11 and Shader Model 5 is required.<br/>The requirement for Lumen in the official document is that NVIDIA GeForce GTX-1070 or higher is required. So I set the required graphics card to 1070 in the minimum configuration.<br/>The requirements for the CPU are small and there are no special requirements.<br/>There may be more low-end graphics card support in future updates, but I can't give a guarantee for now.<br/><br/><br/><strong> Will multiplayer mode be added? </strong><br/>if I want to ensure the quality of online games, it requires a lot of cost to set up independent game servers, which is a big burden for me personally.<br/>But if many people want to be able to be online, then I will definitely increase the multiplayer online part, but this will take at least one to two months.<br/><br/><br/>Because I am alone making indie games and the development time is tight, there is only this version. But if there are feedback from most players that everyone needs a version that can run in a lower configuration, then I will definitely change a version that does not use Nanite and Lumen in a short time for the players who have purchased it to download directly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T10:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fd24a581e412c705bb920d279218ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YZ"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YZ"], "esrb_rating": null}
