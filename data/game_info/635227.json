Every assignment is a war - small, hairy, full of fangs and legs. Pests have no mercy. When Lenny finds himself alone with them, they only want one thing: to tear him apart!

The materials that will be used for this can be found in the store as well as during missions. Those can be later used to upgrade traps and weapons.<br />\nDiscover the city</p>\n<p>You start your work in one of the Cherryhood districts, but as you progress and your reputation grows, you will gain access to new parts of the city. There, of course, the orders will be paid better and the items found will be more and more interesting. The battlefront of your fight with pests runs through home rooms, hotels, factories, laboratories, warehouses and many other unique locations.<br />\nUpgrade your headquarters</p>\n<p>Everyone needs a place to return to after work, so you have your own base that you can upgrade. Each of the rooms (gym, laboratory, scrapper) can be expanded, which will bring you new bonuses!<br />\nCatch pests</p>\n<p>The tasks are different: sometimes it\u2019s a simple neutralization, sometimes you have to catch a living animal, but each pest requires a different approach. Many of them also have their version on steroids, much stronger and more dangerous than a standard representative.

During the game creation no animals were harmed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-15T15:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/4685f7075c6188e8c3a3645013a4d4ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EON46"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ritual Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
