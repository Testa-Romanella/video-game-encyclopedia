Started this about 5 hours before the deadline, as what I was initially working on didn't go to plan. Shotguns!</p><p>EDIT: So I feel like the \"5 hours\" thing is a bit\u00a0disingenuous. While I did create the project 5 hours before the deadline, I didn't create everything included from scratch in those 5 hours. For example, the rain effect is a piece of code I'd made for a game in the latest GMC Jam. The shotgun I had drawn the night before, when I was planning something different for LD40. The movement code for the player, I just grabbed that out of another top-down project of mine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e0db8ae83396131aed36f7957ab14d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kodiqi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
