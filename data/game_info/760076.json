Whoever has the most points (highest combo) when the clock runs out,\u00a0wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will definitely keep working on the game and hopefully be submitting it for the Arcade cabinet.</p>\n<p>I did all the programming, and my girlfriend's 14 year old brother, Anthony, drew all the characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdc/cdcfb3df03a472f422f51141d8a130fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["linusfackler"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
