When Tahn reaches the outer field of the Crystalis, the bridge starts to crumble and Tahn must venture forth; deeper into the interior palace in order to investigate. But when Tahn finds an ancient barrier guarding the steps up to the main chamber, she must dig for clues that will help her switch off the barrier and continue upstairs. Little does Tahn know, Pahk, her former childhood friend, will stand in the way of restoring the Crystalis. As Tahn defeats Pahk and walks over to the main chamber, two empty crystal slots need to be filled. Tahn then realises at this moment she is the only one who can stop the world from blackening with the ultimate sacrifice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Game Details:</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is a student game demo\u00a0made in Unreal Engine, optimised for Windows .\u00a0 Any feedback you have please leave it in the comments section and we will work on any bugs/criticism\u00a0you may have and update the game for you.</p>\n<ul><ul><li>World is set\u00a0in 3rd person for showing off animation skills and character design that fits into the world genre</li><li>Interactable objects, gives players more to do and drive to continue </li><li>Story themes are embedded and discovered through exploring</li><li>Stylised - Low poly models, Hand painted textures, Allows for more creative freedom and imagination to achieve the fantasy look.</li></ul></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Social Media:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to support and leave any reviews/feedback for\u00a0Crystalis via these social media pages:</p>\n<p>Facebook -\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/CrystalisGame/<br/></p>\n<p>Instagram -\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/crystalisgame/</p>\n<p>Twitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/CrystalisGame</p>\n<p>Artstation -\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/crystalis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d6ceaaa3779f6d3180d22e3acd43d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crystalis"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
