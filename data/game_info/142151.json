This was a pretty short dev time for us with a small team and we are really proud of what we could achieve in just a few weeks.Playing the game:Tap and drag from anywhere on the screen to power your ninja jump, then let go to shoot through the air. Aim for any surface not covered in spikes and you&#39;ll stick to it like glue; ready to go again.<br />\nThen once you&#39;ve got the hang of that, try mastering the double jump, or slamming into some enemies for extra points.<br />\nSend him flying high enough, and maybe you&#39;ll unlock an achievement, or even make it on to the leader board!<br />\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Cerebralfix/<br />\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Ninja-Tobu-311712879205277/?fref=ts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-03T18:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01f/01fc75b85d2823c4ed0d20c67522edde.jpg", "website": "http://cerebralfix.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Android", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["CerebralFix"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["CerebralFix"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
