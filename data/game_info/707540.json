Health pickup spawns at the top of the map every once in a while. Going out the sides or bottom of the map causes you to teleport, but don't use it too much! A and D to move, Space to jump, Mouse to aim, Left Click to shoot. Your trusty shotgun can shoot three bullets every second, and will launch you back with some massive recoil if shooting midair. Watch out for the flying bomb-drones! they'll take you out quick. See if you can figure out the patterns on the bomb-drone factories. ;)<br/></p>\n<p>This project is still in development, potential additions are, wave system, more enemies, more maps, more weapons.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun! Post your high score in the comments if you want :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d20/d20f7b21e8fb8a47ad15f20b26e5c745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["falconstrike209"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
