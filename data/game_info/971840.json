You need to control the greedy snake to eat more food, and it will also become longer and longer.<br/>\r\n Press the direction key to control the position of the greedy snake. Be careful not to bite your own body or run out of the screen, otherwise it will be considered a failed challenge. The goal of each level is to successfully control the direction of the greedy snake,<br/>\r\n receive rewards, and then upgrade to the next level. The speed of the Snake will continue to increase with the increase of levels, which is also a test for you. <br/>\r\nLet's challenge your skills and see if you can reach the end.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-07T09:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2b947309f55b779bba86d5ffa295807.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lili K"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["lili K"], "esrb_rating": null}
