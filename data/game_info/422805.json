Most people in school bully you, and your goal is to go a whole week without getting your ass kicked.</p>\n<p>The days don't advance on their own yet, but you can press Ctrl to advance one day manually.</p>\n<p>School is pretty barren right now, my goal eventually is to have it filled with all different students and teachers that all do their own thing throughout the day and when you talk to them.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>NPC RUNDOWN:</p>\n<p>WORKING NPCs:<br/></p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Hector - Blocks the door every day. You can't get into school without giving him 1 resource. Will kick your ass. Has Dialogue for all five days.<br/></p>\n<p>Fisk - Runs around school faster every day. Give him sugar to make him go away. Will kick your ass. Has Dialogue for first day.<br/></p>\n<p>Fiona - Smokes outside every day. She will trade you cigarettes for gum. Will not kick your ass. Has dialogue for all five days.<br/></p>\n\n<p>INCOMPLETE NPCs:</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Lacy - She will stop you and extort a resource from you if she sees you running (only in the hallway). Her range gets larger every day, so if you trigger her from very far away, that's why. [[Lacy isn't working properly, so she may crash your game if she catches you, but most likely she'll just say someone else's lines.]]</p>\n<p>Delores - The Lunch Lady. In the future she will give you chips and soda for cigarettes. Currently she does nothing and doesn't even have any lines, she just says other peoples lines.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/593/5930d0963937d43f1dd534eef043297d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pigeon wings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
