He can jump everytime he touches a platform, but he can't wall jump.\u00a0</p>\r\nBloof in his liquid stat\r\n<p>When Bloof goes liquid, he can shrink himself to go through narrow places.\u00a0He can't jump, don't forget that.</p>\r\nBloof in his gas state\r\n<p>The gas stated Bloof can only move upwards, like a balloon.
