This game was originally released in 1996\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blade was my 20th, last, and most ambitious game for Amiga; an expanded, isometric sequel to my roguelike game Hilt. The game took over a year to develop and was signed to be published by a troubled company named Alive Mediasoft. The game was released without my consent and I received nothing. Unable to take matters further in these moribund years of the Amiga, I released the game for free.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators. The game needs to be installed to a virtual Amiga hard drive, so the RP9 files contain a pre-installed version of Blade. The standalone intro sequence can be viewed separately\u00a0from one of the discs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T06:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c5994305771444a326739c7243df7ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 416, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
