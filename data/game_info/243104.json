Try to jump, shoot, and dodge bullets to the beat of the music.</p>\n<p>The game portrays a prominent hope vs. despair theme which represents the struggle against hopelessness in times of crisis. Music can play a prevalent role in shaping emotions and can also represent one of the avenues with dealing with such a crisis.</p>\n<p>This game is a submission for the Music Game Jam 2018 and is entirely made with original content by me, Zuriel. This is my 3rd game released on itch.io, my 3rd participation in a game jam, and my 2nd game where I felt empowered to express my thoughts through my game. Video games are an underrated and powerful medium to connect ideas and emotions from author to audience. I'm still a beginner at game development, but I'm excited for my future on this journey!</p>\n<p><strong>This game is free-to-play and the downloads for the Mac and Windows executable files are free to download.
