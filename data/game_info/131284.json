Dark Was The Night is a 3rd person narrative game that uses rhythm and stealth elements as it's primary mechanics. The games major goal is to counter ludo-narrative dissonance by linking the struggle of playing blues music in the characters world to the actions of the player. The mental state of Blind Willie is portrayed by the light in the world around him and this is directly effected by playing music. The currency of this game is light. The player must match the rhythm of music as it pans around their head. Matching notes allows them to see the world around them. To inhibit its steady darkening. Light allows the player to traverse a short surreal representation of Blind Willie Johnson's life. Inhabiting his perspective and discovering his life in a storybook style. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0e/d0efcb725bc80d837f01423f88a4f578.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vincentvh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
