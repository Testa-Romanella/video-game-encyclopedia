Each captured projectile gives you two shots of the same element. Press C to shoot the projectile back at the enemy. You can only stockpile eight shots of one type of element at a time.\r\n\t\r\n</p>\r\nLesson 2\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are four different elemental types: lightning, leaf, fire, and water. The mages of the beast tribe of Gloo spent countless hours honing their craft in a single element, which leaves them more susceptible to their counter-element. The cycle goes: Leaf \u2192 Lightning \u2192 Water \u2192 Fire \u2192 Leaf.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\r\nLesson 3\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you're feeling brave, you can press X while standing directly in front of an enemy who is preparing to cast a magic missile to execute a Flash Counter. The sudden bright flash from your camera will startle the enemy into dropping its missile onto its head, inflicting major damage.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\nWhat's New in v.1.4.0<br/>\n<ul><li>MAJOR FIX FOR MACOS: game should now run properly as a standalone app and should no longer need to be run from within the itch.io client.</li><li>Changed the setting of the 3rd level from Field to Castle.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ab/2ab30a4def8c70e60dc246c5eb7b12a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["M.S.T.O.P."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
