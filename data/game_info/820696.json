I love the theme \"Roll of the Dice\" because of my small RPG dice collection.\u00a0Thank you in advance for any advice.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> You run around the map to grab dice and throw them at enemies. Any enemies the dice pass through will be targeted and only take damage once the dice finishes rolling. The more enemies that are defeated, the faster and more durable\u00a0the enemies will become.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move w/ wasd, press space to start, and use the left mouse button to throw dice throw the cursor.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Known Issues:</strong> Dice sometimes disappear when throwing them while near an outer wall. 'Ghost dice' will sometimes appear when grabbing overlapping dice. The\u00a0damage indicator won't appear if enemies are defeated in one shot. Enemies will sometimes spawn on top of the player.</p>\n<p><em>Made w/\u00a0L\u00d6VE<br/>Maps made w/ </em><em>Tiled</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/873/873fe6dfe988a7a6e7fb66f4c60bea18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Krylicrypt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
