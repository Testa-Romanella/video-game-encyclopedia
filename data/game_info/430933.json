Ironically around the same time the whole JamCraft5 jam was starting soon, so figured why not!</p>\n<p>This game is code heavy and most of the time in development was dedicated to making code and making things work, so with that in mind everything, all the assets, are simply cubes. So this is a prototype that looks like basic poop but focus heavy on the programming aspect, so please just keep in mind aesthetics and making things look pretty wasn't the focus especially since this competition was soo time constrained!</p>\n<p><strong><em>:--:CONTROLS:--:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tab = In game Menu</p>\n<p>W, A, S, and D = Movement</p>\n<p>Space = Jump</p>\n<p>Shift = Sprint</p>\n<p>Q and E = Rotating structures in build mode</p>\n<p>E = Interacting with various things</p>\n<p>1,2,3,4,5,6,7, and 8 = Hot bar buttons</p>\n<p>~ = Cheat/Debug Console</p>\n<p><strong><em>:--:HOW TO PLAY:--:</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Originally there was going to be an achievement system to give you certain crafting goals before the world expired but I ran out of time so instead this game is just purely basic crafting and resource management.</p>\n<p>The three primary resources are Sand, Iron Ore and Sticks, these basic components are key to making your factory line and what not so use them!</p>\n<p>Craft tools and structures to help you automatically generate a small westernized factory.</p>\n<p><strong><em>:--:THE STORY:--:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Originally I wanted to make\u00a0 a main menu where you're looking at multiple snow globes on a shelf in a shed, each one a different terrain/world you could play in. For starters there would only be the desert snow globe. Once you hit play\u00a0a falling tool box would hit the shelf the snow globe was on sending it into the air with a stop watch. Then time would slow down as the camera entered the snow globe and play would begin. You would have a second in reality but to your small size it would be comparable to thirty minutes before the snow globe/world you're in would hit the ground ending the game.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Sadly none of this made into the game since the game jam was only 10 days and being a college student working multiple jobs i just didn't have the time unfortunately.</p>\n<p><strong><em>:--:All In All:--:</em></strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to do a lot, but 10 days for the JamCraft5 really isn't enough time especially given my hectic life schedule so I didn't get much more then the basic concepts in and that's about it! I may not have gotten everything i wanted done, but i'm happy I managed to get this far since i'm still new to making 3D games. If nothing else i can cannibalize this project and make other better things.<br/></p>\n<p>But all in all, i'm proud of my unfinished mess, it looks like poo but it's functional poo, XD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00e/00e12f6697dd73a795df34bb0ce57e47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sanctioned13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
