Overtime, we transition into these personas to satisfy the ones around us and forget the part of us that makes us unique. But no matter how much you change, there are always remnants of the past that still remain. Growing up is a game about finding the parts of you that have long been forgotten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Growing up is a narrative driven game that allows you to walk through an environment and interact with different objects. As the player, the more you interact with the environment the more you learn about the story, and the world that you\u2019re playing in.\u00a0 Certain objects impact the way you perceive the world around you. The world changes dynamically based on what the character experiences, in the same way one\u2019s mood might shift after reading something disturbing or moving.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programming/Design: Carl Wiggins</p>\n<p>3D Modeling: Jin Ju</p>\n<p>Voice of girl: Samantha Pires</p>\n<p>Music: Hiroshi Yoshimura</p>\n\n<p>You can follow me on twitter\u00a0@Karu_wiggs for updates and future projects\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T03:42:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/5035673a453309a6371bf64c44e4eecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karu_wiggs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
