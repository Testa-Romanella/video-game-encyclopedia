Animals can't board trains with station staff, so sneak past them and rush to the open doors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbScoring System<br/>\r\nThe more you chain animals, the higher your score. You can keep boarding animals until you run out of lives.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbStamina System<br/>\r\nAnimals lose stamina when they touch station staff or as time passes. Chaining animals restores stamina, but as time progresses, the rate of stamina depletion increases.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u30fbRanking System<br/>\r\nView global rankings online.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSupported Languages: Japanese, English<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloped by a team of four students.
