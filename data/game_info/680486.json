Behind you are the plants that must match the pattern!.</p>\n<p>Click on the plants to cycle them and complete the mirrored sequence!</p>\n<p>Once you are satisfied with your assessment, click on the large green button to journey to the next greenhouse.</p>\n<p>Remember that the sequence must be mirrored for it to be correct, so be sure to use the spin button to flip between the two sides.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unsafe to assess greenhouses at night, so you must complete as many assessments as you can in one day! The faster you complete the assessments, the more clout you will gather. Share your scores in the comment section and see who is the best assessor!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:</p>\n<p>Programming, Audio &amp; Design: Max Kearney\u00a0@KearneyMax<br/></p>\n<p>3D Art: Jess Fittock artstation<br/></p>\n<p>Voice Acting: vattgholu twitch<br/></p>\n<p>Playtesters:</p>\n<p>Tom Turner</p>\n<p>Cassie Cocks</p>\n<p>Lina Huynh</p>\n<p>vattgholu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T04:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebf/ebf27eee1a9c735a30e22edb9940c1b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Maxwell Dexter"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
