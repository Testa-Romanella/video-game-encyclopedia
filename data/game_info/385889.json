Originally planned for mobile (hence the vertical aspect ration), I've kept this demo private for a while, but I've decided to make it public and let everyone play it. <br/></p>\n<p>It's not perfect, and I know there's some bugs, but I enjoyed working on it. Hopefully you'll enjoy playing it for a few minutes or so. Perhaps sometime in the future I'll come back to this flatulent little beast.<br/></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Music graciously provided by Paws Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T05:44:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5192b7755bf5ebe45bf2a9f3862ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dan Emmerson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
