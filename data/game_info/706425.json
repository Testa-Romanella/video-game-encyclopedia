Uso means a lie, something that is not true in Japanese and it is perfect for our game because it is nothing like !osu. The only thing in common is that they are both rhythm games.</p>\n<p>In the menus you will operate with a mouse, but in game controls are Q,W,E,R.</p>\n<p>We are aware of some flaws in the game. For example you can't see which difficulty level you choose, because there are no different difficulties implemented yet. Also there is only one level at the moment so the other play buttons don't work. We would've loved to give you web build to play directly on browser but unfortunately we are having some problems with sounds.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave us some feedback below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T15:53:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d5/5d5900ade6a0fa7bacda37c106dcd8bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Iiiiita", "WilhelmVO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
