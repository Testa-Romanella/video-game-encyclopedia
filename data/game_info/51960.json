{"id": 51960, "slug": "wild-mage-phantom-twilight", "name": "Wild Mage - Phantom Twilight", "name_original": "Wild Mage - Phantom Twilight", "description": "Wild Mage - Phantom Twilight is a multiplayer, open-world action RPG made for small team based adventures, featuring airships, floating islands, dungeons, and next-gen combat.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/><br/>The story is set in the beautiful yet dangerous world of Etherion, which is made up of thousands of islands floating above a dense Miasma. Rising at night and burning off during the day, the Miasma spawns terrible creatures and is a constant menace to the people of Etherion. The only safe areas are located at the top of the islands. Recently the magic keeping the islands afloat has begun to wear off...<br/><br/>As a Wild Mage, you act as the right hand of the Tower of Heaven, Extracting adventures, Escorting Ships, Delivering goods, Reclaiming lost islands.<br/><br/>The airship is the main form of transportation on Etherion. These vehicles play a vital roll in all aspects of life on the Isles.<br/><br/><strong>Game play</strong><br/><br/>The environment in this game is completely destructible. Monsters can be sliced into pieces (think FruitNinjia). Fire propagates dynamically. Terrains and structures can be altered and destroyed (think MineCraft).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important feature of the game is the removal of dps and leveling. Instead, players have to venture into the world in order to acquire power and magic spells from monsters and lore books. And their increase in power is not represented in terms numbers but in physical effects. Let's use a fireball as an example, instead of a higher leveled player having higher dps, a more experienced Wild Mage would be able to generate fireballs of larger size and further reach. It, in a sense, removes a lot of the predictability out of character advancement and enhances the sense of adventure. You can't grind and watch the numbers grow. You need to explore and interact with the world in order to acquire new skills, spells and power!<br/><br/><strong>Missions</strong><br/><br/>Single player or group based dungeons. Group finder or join with your friends. No minimum group size.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/2651ce2a6205d5d0571a8bb71ffa2d13.jpg", "website": "http://www.wildmages.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luna Orion"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Luna Orion"], "esrb_rating": null}
