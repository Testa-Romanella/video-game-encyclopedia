Being my 4th project, this game took nearly a month and a half to fully complete. This game was made in an older version of unity and also plays around with more 3D environmental movement.</p>\n<p>PaintRPG is a color-action RPG where you play as a clay doll that explores the Painter of World's many canvases in order to find his \"Greatest Creation.\" On this journey you will need to master the part of color combination while you fight against other paintballs that inhabit these lands. Color yourself to protect against paintballs of that color or similar, or color your weapon to deal more damage against paintballs of that color or similar. Be warned however, as complements to your color will be stronger against you!</p>\n<p>Currently the game sports only 5 levels, though the gameplay loop is extended to last around 1/2 an hour. The game has potential to get more levels, enemy types, effects, etc. However these are more likely to be apart of a new project extending from the assets of this one.*</p>\n<p>*This new project isn't likely to come soon for a while, and if/when it does it will likely include more enemy types, items, levels, effects, and possibly a rehanged art style or gameplay loop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T10:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a78/a78e90747dc5d70234214912d18cf6ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["IXtimes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
