Play as the sheriff once more, along with his unlikely ally, Private Ben, as you foil a plot to unleash weaponized landsharks onto the world. Yeah, that's right -- landsharks.<br/></p>\n<p>This, too, is a game from my high school days. Despite the outrageous plot, I'm kinda proud of how this turned out. The levels use a GoldenEye-like nonlinear structure to facilitate objective-based gameplay rather than straightforward point-a-to-point-b challenges. Love it or hate it, Sheriff Thomas 2 is a wild ride.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/131/1315d9cb0551cb638e447969ef603b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcus W."], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
