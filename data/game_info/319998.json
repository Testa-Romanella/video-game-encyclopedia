These levels are fun in Mario, and would have been fun to try to recreate that certain aspect. It did take quite some time to create. We used a character controller to figure out basic movement, but since it doesn't automatically slide down slopped surfaces....the challenge was figuring out the math to get it sliding down. Eleanor got on topped of that and it was great. Colin also helped with the level design to make a fun and challenging course, and Jay helped finetuned my movement script to make sure it was the best it could be. (He made some dope music as well). While the project was certainly a lot to take on...I like it. Its cute.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:54:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/85293acea139a20032f7cf2628366830.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dataEcto"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
