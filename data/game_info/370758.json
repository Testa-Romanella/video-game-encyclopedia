The theme was \"Dark Science\" so we explored the idea of alchemy with it being a fantasy darker science.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Potion Seller your workers will automatically gather resources for you and take them back to your shop, when they arrive at your stall you can brew up many different concoctions and then put them on sale for whatever price you would like (although don't expect customers to allow you to rip them off). Use this money and funnel back it into your alchemy practice by hiring more workers or giving them better tools to get you more rare and valuable reagents.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d80010c9bd9029a44f78e5a69bbfce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unbound Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
