Its quite short right now, but i plan on making regular content updates.</p>\n<p>\u00a0So what is Nevermiss about? Its a fast-paced top down game filled with slicing and cutting, nice synth music and many many viruses that you have to fight(not like actual viruses, enemies in the game are viruses). You play as an antivirus programm cleaning computers from waves of viruses.</p>\n<p>The controls are pretty simple:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left mouse button</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0to attack</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Hold Right mouse button</strong>\u00a0 to move towards the mouse.</li></ul>\n<p>And before you ask, no there's won't be any keyboard analogue controls for movement and attacking. Gamepads won't be supported too, sadly.</p>\n<p>If you want to reach me:</p>\n<p>Discord -\u00a0Mira (Koyka)#7126</p>\n<p>Itch - comments<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art, programming and most sounds\u00a0were done by <strong>Miracle_Koyka</strong>,</p>\n<p>other sounds were taken from\u00a0<strong>https://freesound.org</strong>.</p>\n<p>All the nice music was made by\u00a0<strong>Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T04:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b727081e68bea85e8e7fc5d81fc8c666.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Miracle_Koyka"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
