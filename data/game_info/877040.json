(Renewal)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Merlion gains new abilities and strengths by renewing parts of itself.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What sort of experience/message are you hoping to bring across to the player?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We chose to make a fighting game starring the Merlion in order to show that we can only overcome obstacles through embracing the different parts of ourselves and our culture. We took inspiration from the Japanese art of <em>kintsugi </em>\u00a0in order to show that the things that make us different and unique are in fact our strengths that should be embraced.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you end up choosing the direction of the game?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The different \u2018skins\u2019 of the Merlion, as well as the enemy designs, were all based off different cultures\u2019 aesthetics and folklores in order to bring across Singapore\u2019s multicultural heritage. We wanted to show them coming together to create something that is greater than the sum of its parts, just like Singapore itself.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Arrow keys to move\r\n</li><li>Space to jump\r\n</li><li>Z to attack\r\n</li><li>X to heavy attack\r\n</li><li>LeftShift + Z/X to use ability skills (which consumes mana)</li><li>Have fun!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugs:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes the enemy will get a concussion and their AI permanently stops.
