Steering, acceleration and brake (but who needs that really).<br/></p>\n<p>Lots of sliding, because it's fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Crisp, clear graphics<br/></p>\r\nBunch of unique tracks\r\n<p>Many unique tracks in different environments. Each track can also be raced in reverse.\u00a0</p>\r\n1 Power-Up\r\n<p>There is only 1 power-up in the game and it makes you go FASTER! Why would you need anything else?</p>\r\nLadder of challenges\r\n<p>The main mode\u00a0 of the game is a ladder containing varied types of challenges, like time limits, perfect lap,\u00a0good old regular racing and more. Reach higher in the ladder to unlock tracks and vehicles.</p>\r\nChampionship mode\r\n<p>Up to 4 players in splitscreen can play a series of\u00a0tracks in a championship. Score the most points to finish as the champion. Select from all your\u00a0unlocked tracks and race them in any order you like.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Gamepad\u00a0with analog stick and triggers (eg.\u00a0XBOX 360/ONE) for each player is\u00a0recommended.<br/>Up to two players on the same keyboard (depending on keyboard type).<br/>Currently the controls are not configurable (this will be fixed) and are:<br/>Keyboard 1: Up/Down/Left/Right , and . (Pause with ESC)<br/>Keyboard 2: R/F/D/G Z and X (Pause with Q)<br/>X360: Left stick/Left trigger/Right triger A and B (Pause with Start)</p>\r\nDevelopment status\r\n<p>Faster Than You is still in development, but you can support our development by\u00a0buying it early. For a discounted price you will get access to the beta PC-version and all upcoming updates, including the MacOS version when it's released.</p>\n<p>Currently the challenge ladder is not available and because of that you only have the first vehicle and some of the tracks. Which is enough to have plenty of fun :)</p>\r\nRoadmap\r\n<p>These are the big features on the roadmap</p>\n<p>More tracks<br/>Challenge mode (main mode of the game)<br/>Unlockable tracks<br/>Unlockable vehicles<br/>Better AI<br/>Reconfigurable controls<br/>Performance optimizations</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming: Chanan Eli - Velision<br/>Level design: Ulrica Eli - Velision.<br/>3D models: Synty Studios<br/>Music - Muz Station Productions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T05:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07ea430685f2db3a5eb7df4a352873b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Velision"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
