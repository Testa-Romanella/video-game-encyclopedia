There is a hard coded \"maze\" for you to follow to get the basic idea. The procedural maze generation is incomplete and there are no false paths yet. I am also submitting this to the PROCJAM which ends tomorrow, so if you check back later hopefully it will be more complete :))</p>\n\n<p>This is a game about following music through procedurally generated mazes. For each maze a harmonic chord progression is generated and each floor tile from entrance to exit will play one chord of the progression in sequence. Alternate paths through the maze will not lead to the exit and will have a subtly different, less harmonic chord progression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The color palette is also a\u00a0monochromatic set of\u00a0procedurally generated pastel colors. The color palette is regenerated every time the player moves.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The game can also be played in \"blindfold\" mode, where all graphics are disabled and the player navigates purely through sound.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T03:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d1a13042d53d7eb8f0ccf4953ac22d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YDOG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
