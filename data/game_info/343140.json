You set out to fight back in order to avenge the rest of humanity. Shoot and maneuver your way through crowds of aliens, all in the name of revenge.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 This game has been through development hell for a couple years, and this demo is the most stable version. Much like the planet featured in this game, this project is dead, so I decided to upload this version to share with the world the remnants of Etiam.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>themousery\u00a0- Programming\u00a0</p>\n<p>TheGoatIsBetter\u00a0- Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kevin MacLeod\u00a0- Music</p>\n<p>Programmed with<em>\u00a0L\u00d6VE2D\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Lua</em></p>\n<p>Art created with<em>\u00a0Aseprite</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>Clip Studio Paint</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b2/3b29ded8967ac51a091c2fa5096c43c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["themousery"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
