This happens again when placing the fortification. </p><p>- The \"total spirit\" star disappears after losing the game and restarting. </p><p>- The player is unable to place a fortification in a space where a mine was previously destroyed. Spirit is still reduced as if the fortification was placed. This is fixed if the player shift+clicks the space where the mine was previously placed. This removes whatever is blocking placement. </p><p>- Pause screen Santaur quote is behind calendar.</p><p>- Presents stop falling down the slides after Day 1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00f/00fd9c44d5eb2b295a04394c6dc3bfca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZamboniMacaroni"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
