{"id": 53841, "slug": "goal-two", "name": "Goal! Two", "name_original": "Goal! Two", "description": "<p>Goal! Two is a soccer (football) video game developed by Tose for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and published by Jaleco in 1992. Goal! Two is the NES version of Goal! (1992), which Jaleco retitled Super Goal! for European markets. Goal! and Super Goal! are localizations of Super Cup Soccer (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc), Tose's first soccer title for the Super Famicom. Jaleco published Goal! and Super Goal! for the Super NES (SNES) in December 1992, shortly after Goal Two! for the NES. The cover model is John Brady, an amateur soccer player from London who was living in Chicago.</p>\n<p>For the French release of the NES version, Jaleco secured an endorsement from French international footballer Eric Cantona, who had just transferred to Manchester United F.C.. The French packaging bears the name and likeness of Cantona, with the prefixed title Eric Cantona Football Challenge: Goal! 2. The SNES title Eric Cantona Football Challenge, however, is an internationalization of Striker (Rage Software 1992).</p>\n<p>Goal! Two is Tose's first sequel to the NES title Goal! (1989). Goal! for NES is a localization of Moero 5!! Pro Soccer (1988), the fifth installment in the long-running Moero!! sports game series. The Goal! video game series is a spin-off of the Japanese Moero!! series.</p>\n<p>Jaleco followed [Super] Goal! with Super Goal! 2 (1994), a localization of Takeda Nobuhiro no Super Cup Soccer (1993). An additional Super Famicom installment, Takeda Nobuhiro no Super League Soccer (1994) was published only in Japan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d7/1d7412aefae3473586bbc15bc58c4c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES", "SNES"], "developers": ["Tose", "Tose Co."], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Jaleco"], "esrb_rating": null}
