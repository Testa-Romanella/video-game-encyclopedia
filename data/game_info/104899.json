{"id": 104899, "slug": "karistys", "name": "Karistys", "name_original": "Karistys", "description": "<p>Karistys is a prototype of a fast-paced 3D arena first person shooter. It was created as a demo for the Kyssari engine, a game engine project written in four months as an exercise in learning more about game engines by a bunch of students.</p>\n<p>The multiplayer portion of the game was written in as little a time as two or three weeks; hence its an extremely early prototype - a stage I (nor others) cannot promise it will ever rise up from. I or other people may still implement the occasional feature or fix or two, but nothing is promised.<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay is, to be honest, pretty awful and written by people with no prior experience in network programming. It lacks a lot of features, like proper lag compensation for shots, and is likely a buggy mess. This was intended as a tech demo and an exercise, not much else.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a multiplayer game, currently for up to 4 players <br/>(though there's a singleplayer sandbox for testing the physics and <br/>weapons.) The distribution includes a server executable that must be run<br/> on a machine the players can connect to (for instance, on the machine <br/>of one of said players.)</p>\n<p>The code of the engine and the game are both licenced under the GPL version 3 and are hence free and open source software. The code is available at: https://gitlab.com/Partanen/ky...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71e/71e3cfc19b90f6f2315de870855bbf91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kuvis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
