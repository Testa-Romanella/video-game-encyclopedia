To be exact, it is so far into the future that the human species invented faster than light travel, got into a galactic war with itself and bombed itself into a new dark age. This is where the actual story begins. You are Nobody (that\u00b4s his name), a little thief that got his hands on a treasure map. Unfortunately, he stole it from someone very dangerous and now he is being tracked by some very dangerous people. The only option Nobody sees is to find the treasure, grab some of it, and \"piss off\".</p>\n<p><strong><em>Attention: If you press \"ESC\", the game shuts down.
