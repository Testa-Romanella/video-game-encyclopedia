Or go against a friend \n      and see who really owns the turf.\n    </p><p>\n      Jack Flak and Oozie Nelson bring their brawling skills to the street \n      against Big Al and his gang of miscreants, otherwise known as the Street \n      Kings. Test out a myriad of street-fighting techniques against waves of \n      enemies as a lone hero, or bring a sidekick! Take enough punches and \n      your inner Angry Mode will rear its ugly head against your foes. You can \n      also battle against a friend in Vs mode and see who's left standing.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
