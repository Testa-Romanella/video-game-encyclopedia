What are the sensations? But especially,\u00a0<strong>is there a way to wake up from this sleep</strong>? Yes, there is, finally.<br/><br/>It seems that the coma traps us in a sort of parallel world; no one knows exactly how this is done because it turns out to be different for each person, shaped by the memories and emotions of oneself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What is certain, it's that we now know how to wake up from it: it will be necessary to find a series of significant memories, moments so impressed in the character's mind that they are also present in the parallel world that dominates his deep sleep. Memories are often represented in the form of objects.<br/><br/>In this near future,\u00a0<strong>The Inspectors</strong>\u00a0have the delicate task of investigating the human mind in search of those elements that will bring our loved ones back to life.</p>\n<p><strong>Wishlist me on\u00a0Steam!</strong></p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/EdoVentisette\r\n</p>\n<p>I also have a website!\r\n</p>\n<p>http://theinspectorgame.com/</p>\n<p>And a WIKI (in progress)</p>\n<p>Join the Discord!</p>\n\n<p><strong>*LOW HARDWARE NOTES*</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>If your computer is struggling to run \"The Inspector\"\u00a0you can try to deactivate the \"Ambient Occlusion\" or \"Motion Blur\" under the \"Options Menu\".</strong></p>\n<p><strong>*CONTROLLER SUPPORT*</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controllers are partially supported.
