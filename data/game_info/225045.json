It does work but there is no confirmation message like some cheats, try changing weapon and you will have them all.<br/><br/>Also note: The flying cheat for cars doesn\u2019t make them fly; it lowers their gravity so they can glide. This is enough to fly over the broken bridge onto the second island with fast cars such as the mafia car. If you get a tank, it can fly if you rotate the turret and fire backwards while this cheat is activated.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T21:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c812c87e823f0f9630e92c826fe280c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Net Tech Development"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
