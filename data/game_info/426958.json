Solve puzzles and discover mysterious runes while you take in the scenery on the island.</p>\n<p>This game was made as a project to learn about shaders in Unity, so making a game that looked nice was our top priority for this. The game takes about 10 minutes to complete and the main mechanic is walking around and exploring your surroundings.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy, if you decide to try it out. :)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game made by:</p>\n<p>Levi Moore (@LeviMooreDev)</p>\n<p>Daniel Hansen (@Wanieru)</p>\n<p>Camilla Vallentin (@Vallencavnt)<br/></p>\n\n<p>3D models by:\u00a0@Quaternius</p>\n\n<p>Wind sound by:\u00a0DN_KP</p>\n<p>Fox Icon by: Delapouite</p>\n<p>Music by: Camilla Vallentin (@Vallencavnt)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:39:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/91798c7175373eed119f822467b59983.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrostBandit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
