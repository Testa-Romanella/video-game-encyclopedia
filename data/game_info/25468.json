Join \n      Ash, Brock, Misty and many more characters from the Pok\u00e9mon animated \n      series as they gather in Puzzle Village to compete for the title of \n      Pok\u00e9mon Puzzle Master. Just match three or more blocks of the same color \n      in any direction. Sounds simple, right? But the actual game-play is \n      surprisingly deep (chains and combos anyone?) and addictive, especially \n      when you\u2019re facing off against a human opponent. Choose from six \n      different modes offering a wide range of action, from a story mode or \n      solving preset puzzles to continuous play or timed play. If that\u2019s not \n      enough, take on the challenge in 3D and get ready for more blocks than \n      ever before. Featuring animated cut scenes combined with bright, fun \n      graphics, there\u2019s enough to satisfy anyone who is a fan of Pok\u00e9mon or \n      puzzle games!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
