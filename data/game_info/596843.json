The game puts you in the shoes of a soldier of the blue army. Hundreds upon thousands of Red bots are invading your homeland! How long can you last before they overwhelm you?!?!</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>Theme</strong> of the game jam was the word 'Descent'. I looked up the definition to see if their were other meanings aside from the one that popped in my head instantly and Merriam Webster said \"<strong>5</strong>a<strong>:\u00a0</strong>ATTACK,\u00a0INVASION\u00a0//<em>descent</em>\u00a0of the locusts\"</p>\n<p>And thus I knew what I was going to make. All assets including images and art were made by Me. <strong>Except</strong> for the Weekly Game Jam logo and the GDevelop logo if it wasn't obvious yet.</p>\n<p>I would love to continue this project because many features I\u00a0wanted to add I couldn't due to lack of knowledge of GDevelop's logic systems. If you have suggestions just let me know in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d8d3920d02f51f4934ef0a18c2295cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Johnny"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
