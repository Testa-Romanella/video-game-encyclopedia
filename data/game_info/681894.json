That's cool. That's more than just cars and Disney characters.\"'\n\n'So we wanted to create a game where, you know, she's like, \"Let's say I'm the DJ, and I'm a street-corner guy, and I'm driving around. And if I'm outpointing someone and I'm trying to get the car to turn this about 200 feet, they're going to get a bit nervous.\"'\n\nShe continued: 'So we wanted to present a mixed reality, for show and tell, that people can enter, and for everybody to be able to play in this world, and be connected to that, but without the people occupying that space in any way [or] knowing who the characters are, or even many of them.\n\n'That was really cool for me, but also just the sheer logistical and time-consuming part of building this game and putting together the world first, and the folks that worked on that, and the things that we didn't yet have.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:03:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2db37d1bb7feb4fb2fae5a3e118e9a00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
