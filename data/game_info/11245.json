A wedding interrupted, a bride kidnapped; our heroes give chase. Though their motives are different, they soon find themselves thrown together as their simple quest to recover the bride spirals into an epic saga of war, love, and betrayal.<br/><br/>Treason, defection, rebellion, and even the creation of a new nation are all parts in which you\u2019ll have a role to play. As you progress further, the scope of the story will grow with your heroes. By the end, you\u2019ll have to weigh your decisions and their consequences against the fate of entire nations.<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><ul><li><strong>Characters Make the Story </strong>\u2013 Echoes of Aetheria is more than just a story; it\u2019s a tale about people.

In turn, this sets the stage for our story, which begins as a whimsical light-hearted adventure and ends as an epic campaign of unprecedented size and scope.<br/></li><li><strong>There's No Place Like Home</strong> \u2013 As you travel around the world, you\u2019ll always have a home base to return to.

Not Here!</strong> \u2013 Enemies all have their own map AI. Will you brute force through encounters or stealthily sneak by to save resources? You can sneak up behind an enemy to gain the advantage of surprise. But be wary, because they can also sneak up on you!<br/></li><li><strong>A New Battle System</strong> \u2013 Tired of JRPGs that still rely on outdated RPG mechanics?
