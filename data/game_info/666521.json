{"id": 666521, "slug": "roach-run", "name": "Roach Run", "name_original": "Roach Run", "description": "<p><strong>Roach Run</strong> is a first-person shooter game where the enemies are... <strong>cockroaches</strong>! Your goal is to kill as many as possible before getting touched by too many of them and becoming overwhelmed with fear.</p>\n<p>Your weapon of choice is a <strong>cockroach-killer spray</strong>. Unfortunately, its content is limited so you have to keep an eye for <strong>power-ups</strong> randomly spawning around the house every now and then. Every time you kill a cockroach you gain <strong>score points</strong> and an <strong>ammo bonus</strong> and your <strong>fear diminishes</strong> by a certain amount.</p>\n<p>As if all that isn't horrific enough, cockroaches will <strong>appear at an increasing rate</strong> as you kill more and more of them.</p>\n<p>You can control your character in the typical first-person shooter fashion, that is, using the <strong>WASD</strong> or <strong>arrow keys to move</strong>, <strong>spacebar to jump</strong>, <strong>shift keys to run</strong>, the <strong>mouse to look around</strong> and the <strong>left mouse button to fire</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Roach Run</strong> was developed as a demonstration and educational aid for the purposes of the <strong>Digital Games Development seminar</strong> organized by the<strong> Interactive Systems Design Laboratory, Department of Product and System Design Engineering, University of the Aegean</strong> and held in September 2018 in Syros, Greece. As such, it is purposely incomplete (things like proper bounding shapes, navigation meshes on furniture, enemy health bars, game mechanics fine-tuning, etc., left to students as exercises).</p>\n<p>The original source code of Roach Run is available as a GitHub repository.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab1f6c9100e6aea94c580d46e0ba974f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ganast"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
