We have been working on <strong>Project:Blue</strong>, a 3D Top Down Labyrinth Game.<br/>Some of you have seen the original version that we've made in the Global Game Jam 2020 (neooutput.itch.io/project-blue), and today we'd like to show you a whole new prototype totally remade in Unreal Engine 4.<br/><br/>We want to continue developing the game, and hopefully release it one day. Your feedback would be highly appreciated.<br/>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd8367a9f8b47337788e81c7c37df60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NeoOutPut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
