In your haze, you also remember that today is your totally awesome birthday party with popular people.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Without any clothes on you set out and order a ride share, but for some reason it\u2019s on the other side of town and you have to be there in less than a min! (So rude!)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your objective is to run as fast as you can to your ride share pick up and, along the way, grab whatever clothes you can through together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShow up naked!\u201d, you say. Well, we won\u2019t stop you, but the rest of society might say otherwise.</p>\n<p>-----<br/>**Controls**</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Run towards clothing items to pick them up</p>\n<p>**Note** The game does not end on it's own. You may need to `alt + F4` to quit</p>\n<p>-----<br/>A note from Team Weekenders*</p>\n<p>Thanks a bunch for checking our game out. One of the challenges we faced as a team was our availability for the weekend and our skill sets, which lead to us over scoping on what we were able to do. Sadly, we weren't able to get all the bells and whistles in our game that we had hoped for. The game is still pretty goofy and it runs! (lol). You can run around and pick up things and run into objects. We hope to continue on with this in the future, but for the jam, this is what we were able to get done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks again and we can't wait to play what y'all made!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/165ba59fb05bfb8be0099e5a3fb7b854.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["snowschu", "taqueso", "chrisRONIN"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
