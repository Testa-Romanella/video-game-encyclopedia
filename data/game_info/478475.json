Fight of all the enemies in each level to proceed to the next weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong><em>WASD</em> or <em>Arrow</em> keys to move. <em>Space</em> to shoot/interact. <em>Escape</em> to pause and/or quit. You may be able to play the game with controller (standard unity support), but i havent tested that.</p><p><strong>Font: </strong>Kenney Pixel Font</p>\n<p><strong>Music: </strong>Laser and Phaser by\u00a0Evan King\u00a0 (weekly loops season 2)</p>\n<p><strong>Sfx: </strong>Made in bfxr or from freesound.org</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge: </strong>Made in just over 4 days for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2 with the theme REWIND.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Theme interpretation:</strong> I did not\u00a0want to go with the\u00a0obvious and wanted to try alot of different things in the same game. That ended up making this somewhat wierd game where you get rewinded back through the history of weapons on earth, as a part of an experiment to find the meaning of violence on earth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:10:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff78963414b93e9d46f0cb7d51c77b31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElbiBeck"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
