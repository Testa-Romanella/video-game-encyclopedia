Players are to choose one of three characters and begin battle where to win one must have the highest kill count before the time ends. Using whacky animations, over exaggerated sounds and ragdoll effects, Slapstick Fighters allows for a twist on the overall serious arena combat games.</p>\n\n<p>Slapstick Fighters is a game of wits, skill, determination and laughs. Set in a world of plush stick-figures in which everyone expresses themselves through quirky and exotic grunts and groans, two players collide when the fate of their pride is on the line.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T06:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c4fbb4a644cba45d997bb43a7cae88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fatherbeno", "Kevin_T"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
