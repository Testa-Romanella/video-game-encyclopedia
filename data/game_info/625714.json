Follow your guiding animal spirit through a magical forest. She will lead you to a secret ritual place, where your ritual takes you to the stones. There, you will take part in a transforming experience that unites your elements; fire, air, water, earth and the spirit. Together with your elemental goddesses, you move and dance, to align yourself with the cosmos. <br/><br/>This is a poetic, transformative, self healing experience that lifts the flow of energy from the earth to the body and eventually to the cosmos. Our aim is to create a feeling of unison between you and the cosmos. We hope this will feel somewhat similar to being inside the painting of a poem. A narrative poem, with fantasy elements. The setting will be Stonehenge: A magical place that is wrapped in history.<br/><br/>Embodiment is an important aspect of this experience. You will be using hand gestures to navigate, interact and dance inside the game. Watch out because your hands will shapeshift!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T02:44:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abbc79218cd1b16c37f9bdb1b94c75b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mekan Space Experience Design Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mekan Space Experience Design Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
