Having gone through uni, I decided to apply some finishing touches and publish this game.<br/></p><p>In Rush, the player must race against time in a series of levels filled with obstacles in order to evade the 'chaser' and\u00a0earn the\u00a0best\u00a0medals\u00a0possible.</p>\n<p>The levels get harder as you progress through the game! The Chaser moves considerably faster and the obstacles are more difficult to avoid, and cause greater impact when collided with.\r\n#arcade</p><p>Play in browser, or download for yourself. <br/></p><p>P.S.
