However, not only do the sounds made by human voices or\u00a0human-made instruments have these powers; many other creatures\u00a0use their voices and bodies to make noise and music, mainly to\u00a0hunt; some even say that it is the howling of the winds that makes\u00a0the air cold, and the rumbling of the thunder that creates lightning.</p>\n<p>Thus, music has shaped the history of these lands. In this age,\u00a0the Instrumentalists are the ones in power. Both a church and an\u00a0army, the Instrumentalists have a rigid hierarchy and a strict code\u00a0of conduct \u2013 which, among other things, only allows them to play\u00a0certain instruments and perform the scores composed by the dead\u00a0Masters \u2013, and only one goal: to make sure that, when the time\u00a0comes, the Undying Orchestra performs the Requiem \u00c6ternam,\u00a0which will bring the end of the world.</p>\n<p>To oppose the oppression of the Instrumentalist rule and to\u00a0avoid the apocalypse they wish to bring about are the goals of the\u00a0Metal Bands, groups of rebellious, barbarian musicians who, as\u00a0the long-gone ancients did, play instruments made of a rare metal\u00a0called vibrium \u2013 which makes them much louder than regular\u00a0instruments \u2013 and compose their own scores. Since the Undying\u00a0Orchestra began performing the Requiem \u00c6ternam, the war\u00a0between the Instrumentalists and the Metal Bands has become\u00a0more violent and urgent and, if the doctrines are true, the end may be near.</p><p><em>Tyst Borg</em>\u00a0is an independent production by Tragos Games and is not affiliated with Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games or Stockholm Kartell.
