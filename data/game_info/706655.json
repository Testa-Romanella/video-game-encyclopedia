Built upon a custom game engine\u00a0<strong><em>CoffeeMaker</em></strong>, this is my first ever attempt at both a public video game release and game engine. UCI is a endless space shooter in which your goal is to destroy as many drones as possible with the given about lives you have. Your score, if it makes the top 3,\u00a0will be saved after each session. Try to beat your best high score with every play through!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This project is in public alpha release.
