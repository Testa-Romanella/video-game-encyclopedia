The objective of the game is to find pairs of adjacent numbers that add up to 10, or pairs of similar numbers that are adjacent to each other.</p>\n\n<p>The gameplay is simple and easy to understand. You start by looking at the grid of numbers and scanning for adjacent pairs of numbers. If you find a pair of numbers that add up to 10, you can select them and remove them from the grid. This will earn you points and clear up space on the grid for more numbers.\r\n</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you find pairs of similar numbers that are adjacent to each other, you can select them and remove them from the grid as well. This will also earn you points and clear up space on the grid.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game becomes more challenging as you progress through the levels, with more numbers added to the grid and fewer opportunities to find pairs of adjacent numbers or similar numbers. The game also includes power-ups and bonuses that can help you clear the grid more efficiently or earn more points.\r\n</p>\n<p>Overall, Yeah 10 is a fun and addictive puzzle game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages and skill levels.
