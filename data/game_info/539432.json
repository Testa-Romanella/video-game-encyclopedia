In this planet, lived a humans\u2019 creator. They went to this planet with a plane, namely Agelada-05. When they were arrived to the unknown planet, something out of expectation was\u00a0happening there. They thought the planet will be a quite friendly place for human living, but when for the first time they got their foot stepped down, they found a cave with so many thick\u00a0liquid inside some jars inside that. They did not know if the jars were fulfilled with newest formulas the human's creator made to destroy human living.\u00a0 He wanted to create other type of creature which more perfect than humans but unfortunately he was poisoned by his own formulas before sending them to the earth through a black hole (shortcut tunnel) he made in a secret place of his planet. If the formulas had a contact to humans, they would form a new creature called Alien while humans with the contact would be dying. The more humans they could infect, the bigger their power. Poorly, the crews did not know about this and touched the liquid. Soon after touched, they all dead and formed many Aliens. Hera, a woman astronaut sent to the planet to confirm what happened to the crews sent\u00a0before her, since the crews did not respond all of the calls from earth. When she landed, she found this planet had very similar scenery to the earth; she found fresh air and plants. Then, she found the cave. Her adventure started.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c5/5c51134762673c0c4aa00e741fb1b084.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amethyst2018"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
