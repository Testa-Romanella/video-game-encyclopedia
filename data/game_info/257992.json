I will be submitting this<br/>to the ProcJam game jam, as well as working<br/>on it for full release in the next 3 months.<br/><br/>Arrow keys for movement and jumping, controller should<br/>work as well. Space jumps too and you can also use WASD for<br/>movement, not sure if W jumps though yet.<br/><br/>Thanks to Jerrtato for making the character sprite, and to Blank Canvas for making the bigger image of Rachel!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bf/6bfd0f722adbee1a4b800bcb0e1c3380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zombievirals"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
