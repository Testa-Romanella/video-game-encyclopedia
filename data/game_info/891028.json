No walking, running, strafing, jumping, crouching, sprinting etc.<br/><br/><strong>Movement Tips</strong><strong><br/>You can start moving only by grappling or rocket jumping!</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Grappling:</strong> Point and at any surface (except the red ones) and click Right mouse button to shoot the grapple hook at that point and reel yourselves in. Click once to grapple, click again to cancel. Your cross-hair will show a \"V\" shape if grappling is possible. While grappling, you have a bit of air control with the WASD keys.</li><li><strong>Rocket-Jumping:</strong> Shoot directly beneath yourselves with the rocket launcher to throw yourselves up in the air. The blast will not damage you.</li><li><strong>Ground-Sliding:</strong> If you have momentum from grappling or rocket-jumping, you can hold shift to slide away on the floor infinitely. You can turn around and shoot in any direction while sliding. Like a tank.</li><li><strong>Wall-Sliding:</strong> Same as ground-sliding but you can jump off a wall while wall-sliding by pressing space. You can slide on a curved wall too on the concave side.</li><li><strong>Air-Control: </strong>Use WASD keys to control your movement while in the air.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Rocket Launcher:</strong> Its the weapon you have at all times. It has infinite ammo. Its blast cannot hurt you and can be used to throw yourselves in the air. Does moderate damage. Click left-mouse button to shoot it.</li><li><strong>Railshot:</strong> The red gun gets attached to your rocket launcher when you pick it up. It can be shot only once. You can carry only one at a time. It can hurt all the enemies caught in the beam. Does significant damage. Press E to shoot it.</li><li><strong>Lock-on Missile packs:</strong> The green dual-missile packs shoot 12 lock-on missiles rapidly. Press Q to fire missiles. The missiles will lock on to all enemies caught within the lock-on sights from the time you pressed fire till when the last missile has been shot. A single missile does lower damage than your rocket.</li><li><strong>Spike-Cage:\u00a0</strong>The spike cage with RGB lights can be used to stab enemies by grappling onto them. Once picked up, it will activate when you grapple. It will last for 50 seconds. Does massive damage.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Pickups</strong>: Chips and Sodas heal.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Enemies<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Alien Wizard:</strong> Shoots a homing fire ball and runs away. Minor annoyance. Kill when convenient.</li><li><strong>Alien Elf Girl:</strong> Runs at you and shoots an arc. Dangerous at close range. Keep moving.</li><li><strong>Identified Flying Hat:</strong> Hovers and shoots a barrage of plasma shots. Seems relatively harmless but will get you when you don't expect. Keep moving to avoid getting shot.</li><li> <strong>Martian Stone Golem:</strong> Shoots a really fast ground wave and punches you if close.</li><li><strong>One eyed green\u00a0sniper</strong>: Shoots a laser beam that can't be dodged. You will know when a shot is coming when you see a faint green aiming beam coming from the sniper. Shoot at this enemy to stop the coming shot or get behind a wall or a Martial Golem. Very dangerous enemy. Get rid of the snipers as quickly as possible.</li><li><strong>Wizard of the War of the Worlds:</strong> Shoots a barrage of plasma shots and casts explosions around you. Watch out for the violet and green circles that warn of the coming explosion. Don't stand still when this one is around.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Coding:Annandistance, theRanchKeeper<br/>3D art: Annandistance, Parapsychic, Scorpiofermi<br/>Support: Pandaboi, Ram<br/></p>\n<p>We have used some third-party sounds.
