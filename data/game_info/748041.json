It is a\u00a0quick clicker with elements of resource gathering and management. Your task is to rebuild and investigate a castle, however to get money for the renovations you will need to sell magical items made with resources you can create within different rooms. While playing the game, unlock new rooms for more types of resources and discover recipes for more expensive items.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy playing it, as I'm very proud of creating it without any previous coding experience.</p>\n\n<p>Mechanics/How to:</p>\n<p>Everytime you click on a room you get a corresponding resource. You can open a crafting menu to create items using gathered resources. When you finally craft an item you can then sell it for profit. You can use your money to upgrade the castle or hire help. You finish the game after buying the castle renovation.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the castle and its history go check out our WorldAnvil:</p>\n<p>https://www.worldanvil.com/w/erkar-michael-maadcet/a/jinnar-s-castle-landmark?pr...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T14:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b96bb3dcf677c034ec84a563127353.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mischeal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
