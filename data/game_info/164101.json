I came up with a bunch of serious ideas then asked myself why not just make a game where you have a gun that shoots bees. So uh. I did that. Very refreshing to make a really silly game for once that's not really trying to do anything clever and is just stupid and fun.</p><p>PRO TIPS:<br/></p><ul><li>There's a boss at Wave 20, after wave 20 the game gets exponentially harder with each passing wave until you're overwhelmed.</li><li>You can explore the map to find big sources of nectar but it's very risky, learn when the best times are to hunt for nectar!</li><li>You can't shoot through flowers and bees get distracted by it which affects your aim, so collect them quickly whenever possible!</li><li>BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ</li></ul><p>48 hour Development Time lapse<br/></p><p>LD entry: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=p...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbdd188691ee7581a72bb6f9427c2475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaunJS"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
