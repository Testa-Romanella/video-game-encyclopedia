{"id": 590941, "slug": "asymmetric-climb", "name": "Asymmetric Climb", "name_original": "Asymmetric Climb", "description": "<p>This prototype explores the concept of asymmetric VR. This means that while one player plays the game on a VR headset the other one plays on a desktop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game, the VR player has to reach the end of a climbing course while the desktop player tries to stop him by shooting him down.</p>\n<p>Besides the climbing mechanic, the VR player has to look out for his stamina that is represented by green circles on the back of each hand. Once the stamina depletes, the player will lose his grip and fall.</p>\n<p>Even if the desktop player is unable to win, the game is still fun to play around with.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>\n<p>Obs.: To play the game you must have an HTC Vive or a Valve Index headset! Unfortunately, Oculus headsets are still not supported.</p>\n<p>After starting the game both VR and desktop players spawn inside a Menu Level. The <strong>VR player\u00a0</strong>is responsible for changing levels by pointing one controller towards the\u00a0big nearby Menu Buttons that are hovering close to the ground and pressing the trigger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Levels</strong></p>\n<p>Subida ao Topo (To The Top) - This level is the VR climbing game that\u00a0is described at the beginning of the description.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An\u00f5es Raivosos (Angry midgets) - In this game, the desktop player has to reach the VR player. The VR player on the other hand has to defeat the desktop player by\u00a0shooting arrows with a bow found nearby (Currently hidden by a very dark shadow).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sorry for the untranslated in-game titles and the minor\u00a0bugs... But I hope you have a great time playing our game! \ud83d\ude0a</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:52:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca5/ca5c0ace038de3ae79f9e598a74854c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Guilherme Schoueri", "fredcurti"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
