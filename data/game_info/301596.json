To achieve this you can make use of all your skills, tricks, luck, of shortcuts and also emerging mechanics\u2026 <strong>if it can be done it is allowed!</strong>WHY THIS?I created Speedrun Ninja because I was missing some platformer game where I could be playful and casual but at the same time it would give me the chance to engage in a more hardcore game play and compete with other players in case I wanted.<br/><br/>Speedrun Ninja presents to the player a series of runs composed of different levels which normally have more than one way to finish them, some of them are obvious, others fun and silly and others just the fastest! Choose your way!<br/><br/>Due the physics and an slightly unpredictable jump mechanic the skills for beating this game the fastest possible are composed of an 80% memory muscle and timing and 20% improvisation and reaction.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96a/96a7bcade863a927d7c42b6ae090fc6a.jpg", "website": "https://speedrun-ninja.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aghko"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aghko"], "esrb_rating": null}
