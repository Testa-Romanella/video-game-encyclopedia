You may have to drop some of the cash to cross the street fast enough to not get ran over by traffic!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Control the robber using <strong>WASD, arrow keys, or with a D pad</strong> on a standard controller. R key is used to restart the game (\"Y\" on a controller). Space button or E key\u00a0is used to drop some of the collected loot allowing the player to run faster! (Spacebar, \"A\" on controller).</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>\u00a0It has been noted that this game (and likely other GODOT 4 Beta Web games) do not function on all web browsers. I have tested it on Chrome, Opera and Edge with success. Firefox on the other hand did not work. Additionally particle effects do not work in the web version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>BAD PARKING was made for TriJam #195 and was made in 5 hours, two full hours beyond the 3 hour limit! Guess I just couldn't \"cut my loses\" on a few features.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound was created in Chiptone and 1BitDragon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T15:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/52035f4476661d18ab55816e805b6174.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheArchSaint"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
