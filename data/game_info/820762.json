And on top of that, she's late for work at the bank!</p>\n<p>(And also she's a robot; just pretend not to notice the default Unreal Engine model.)</p>\n<p>Every time you input movement via [WASD], the game will roll to determine your degree of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 success.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jumping with [SPACE] will also require a roll to see just how well you leap.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, looking around with the mouse is free.<br/></p>\n<p>Bright red objects\u00a0 indicate you must roll to succeed. You might have to interact with [E] or you might roll automatically.</p>\n<p>To critically fail at any time, perhaps to try to jimmy your way out of getting stuck in a wall (what, no, that will never happen), press [F] to immediately roll a natural 1.</p>\n<p>You win if you get to work at the bank before time runs out. If not, well, you're fired. But you can always try again.</p>\n<p><em>This is my first game that has even approached being considered \"complete\", so thank you so much for playing!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T03:29:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8d/c8d8ade78ae9a89d0186c5cc7d99019c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Cat Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
