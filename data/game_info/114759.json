Why? Because this is my #GBJam entry!<br/>GBJam (www.gbjam.net) is \"a video game development JAM that developers will spend a week and develop a game based around the theme of <strong>GameBoy</strong>\". Why everything is gray? Because we were obligated to use only 4 colours. Isn't that great? </p><p>In <strong>Castle Conqueror</strong> your goal is to kill as many enemies as you can and collect as many silver monets as you can hold! Don't worry about clearing whole castle. You wont do this! Instead try to not die to quick, and climb to top of highscore!</p><p>Additional graphics by Wojzax.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/349ef39e50fba5f59c5e557658c465bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Threef"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
