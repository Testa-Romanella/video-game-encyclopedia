If you feel offended by crude and dirty humour you may run away <br/>now. The game also features pixel violence and promotes the consumption <br/>of meat. If you are a hardcore vegetarian, you might very much dislike <br/>the game or just have a good laugh.</p>\n<p>Our hero, known to his friends as Hermes, lives \r\nin France, the country of love which is also known for its exquisite \r\ncuisine. One day Hermes had an appetite for grilled chicken. Certainly a\r\n man's man like Hermes, wouldn't go to the supermarket for frozen \r\nchicken. No! He's going to slaughter his own farm-raised free range \r\nchicken, but this chicken has a mind of his own. This is where our story\r\n starts...</p>\n<p>Chase the escaped chicken to catch it and prepare yourself an unforgettable barbecue-grilled chicken.</p>\n<p>Yummy! But hell, that chicken sure runs fast!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49b3a353095b9fa89c462a1c3f548fc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Retroguru"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
