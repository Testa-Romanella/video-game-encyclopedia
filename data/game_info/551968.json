You don't actually make any money, because.... uh... you live in a dystopia for robots and your just a slave (I ran out of time). The day doesn't actually end, because... uh... the theory of relativity and stuff, idk (I ran out of time). Why do the items just teleport to the register? Well, because... uh... ghosts. Yep (I ran out of time).<br/></p><p>How it fits the theme: The less you sell something for, the more items you can sell. The pink things are discounts, and they make the items go to the register sooner.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Walking - WASD - Left stick</p>\n<p>Interacting - Space or \"e\" - x or a</p>\n\n<p>This is my second game jam and second game. I really thought I would have enough time to add in music, sound,\u00a0more art, menus, and *cough* an actual end to the game. I'm still happy to have created something for the first time in a while, but yeah.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T12:04:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f05/f0580114e136b85762c9ca66e814e05f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fire_Phantom7"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
