You've been called by a friend to an out of the way medieval castle \r\nto help with a discreet and mysterious business. But what's with his \r\nother guests? And his aide? Not to mention your friend isn't quite \r\nhimself either\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Before the Faire</em> is an unfinished visual novel inspired by content from Open Game Art. It's only an introduction, because for a number of reasons I was never able to complete it. There are 10-15 minutes of gameplay, in which I tried to build an expressive vocabulary that draws a little inspiration from (silent) movies -- something I haven't seen in any other visual novel, despite using only basic features of Ren'Py.</p>\n<p>Like all my work, <em>Before the Faire</em> is entirely open source. Being made \r\nwith Ren'Py, all the relevant game data is easily accessible in the \r\narchives if you want to write your own continuation. My notes on the characters and story are available on request.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd26769d45c2b1670d0babadb1bda7e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["No Time To Play"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
