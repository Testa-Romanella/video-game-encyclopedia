It is at a very early stage of development at the moment which is why this Steam store page is Unlistedand only available to those who have the url shared with them.<br />\nThe reason we are releasing this extremely early version of the game totally free is to begin to build a community of players who can help us develop this game with their feedback and support.<br />\nThe co-founders of Freejam (original creators of Robocraft) have been hard at work developing a powerful new Robot building online physics engine. It is with this new physics engine that we aim to create - in time - a builders paradise. A game with incredible freedom to build any machine you can imagine and then bring it to life. A game which allows you to play solo, with friends, and competitively against others in a large variety of game modes which challenge your machine building skills.<br />\nNB: The original Robocraft game is still in active development by a separate team and still being regularly updated.<br />\nPlanned features are:<br />\nBuild machines from high fidelity modular components and bring them to life, control them yourself, and even hop in and drive them<br />\nInvite Friends to build with you and pit your machines against each other or play cooperatively in your own locally hosted sandbox<br />\nEdit your machines whilst they are moving, adding and removing parts during simulation, even when playing online<br />\nCompete online with other players pitting your designs against theirs in official events which change frequently on a regular basis<br />\nBuild your own maps and even your own games with in-game editors and share them with the community<br />\nBuild machines at crazy scales from RC Cars to Star Destroying space ships<br />\nFree-to-play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T17:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f6/2f64b3cf144ae54188237873a02b8edd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.06, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 1553, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 20}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 53, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 53, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freejam"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Freejam"], "esrb_rating": null}
