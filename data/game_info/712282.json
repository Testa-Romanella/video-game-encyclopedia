An archaeological team is supposed to examine the corridor that is partially stabilised with support structures. Indefinable symbols and signs are found on the salt walls. A water vein was exposed when it was blown up and the possible semantics of these notations could be forgotten forever. An archaeologist named Dr. Diana Smith was asked to decipher the notations and finds a crystal skull in the chamber. She removed the skull through a hypnotic influence. Suddenly the skull is glowing and the access to the tunnel is starting to collapse. Diana passed out and the skull fell to the floor. Your team was able to get her body in time out of danger. When Diana woke up, she was not trapped in her body but in the skull. Again she heard the same voice: \"Diana help me to find my skeleton parts and I will release you, unfortunately I am too weak to do this, but together we can reactivate my powers. I will also entrust you with the secrets of my world. \" This was the voice of the mystical creature named Bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is the beginning of the adventure of the two souls as \"Diana Bones\"\u2026.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90b/90b0e7b0001861fa6d0a45f02bfa10b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chinchilla_games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
