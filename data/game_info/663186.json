Can you find all forgotten artifacts and survive to tell the tale? You have your feet and wits against traps and protectors of the old treasures.</p>\n<p>Controls: Move with arrow keys. M = map and it can also be clicked with mouse, P = pause. Menus work with mouse. Cutscene can be skipped with standard keys.</p>\n<p>This, our second game was also made in 8 days. We tried something different and ended up finishing with a playable game with a cool cutscene.</p>\n<p>Bugs: Walking towards sliding wall kills you even if the door doesn't move. WebGL cutscene lags so YouTube version has been added above!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T06:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea6e8fddcb01f44b3684d7ab3a234b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RatJar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
