Since it takes a lot of focus to balance it on your head like that, you can't swing your sword accurately with it on you! Keep it away from the hordes of monsters for as long as you can, and be careful not to drop it. Goblet can take 3 hits while you can take 5.<br/></p>\n<p>Created in a little over a week for my first ever game jam, Lone Rabbit's Multiplayer Jam 2022!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Made in Godot 3.5.
