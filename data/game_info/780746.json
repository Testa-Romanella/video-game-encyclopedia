When you have downloaded the zip file then you need to make sure you drag the app into the applications folder before running it else you may get a \"game not found\" error message when launching it.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you are running OSX:Catalina or above\u00a0then this game may report an issue stating that it is damaged and should be moved to the trash.\r\n</p>\n<p>Open a Terminal window and type the following command:<br/></p>\n<p>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine and then leave a space, and then drag the .app file onto the Terminal window so the full path to the file is present. Once you press enter the fix will be applied and the game can then be run normally.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Faces of Qube is three mini games for a game jam project based on the six sides of Qube. I chose to do a couple of dice games, which was kind of obvious, but also put in a version of Wordle just to mix it up a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dice games have their own help screens to work out how to play them and, by now, Wordle is pretty self-explanatory. I'm just using a bog-standard 5 letter words list for the puzzle in this case but I may expand on this at a later date to theme it, after the competition ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T13:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d3bf537c08754a4460984d9bcf75f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Xerra"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
