When flying over the houses, the chimney will tell you how many presents need to be delivered. The player then shoots that many presents into the chimney. They get points for every present delivered and then a bonus for delivering all presents to a single house. During the game alien spaceships will appear and abduct people. The number of people abducted will appear on the ship. The player will have a chance to shoot down the ship to save the people before it leaves. The player will get a bonus for every person saved but lose points for people abducted that leave the level. Then there are alien snowmen that shoot snowballs at you. Getting hit will reduce your score. Then finally at the end of the level you must beat Bad-Santa.  If you run out of presents before you beat Bad-Santa it is game over. High scores are recorded each round. Only you can save Christmas!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T04:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/385/385b10b7e9407c857d7d5db4b5121a85.jpg", "website": "https://www.frozendungeon.com/present-cannon-rebirth", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frozen Dungeon"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Frozen Dungeon"], "esrb_rating": null}
