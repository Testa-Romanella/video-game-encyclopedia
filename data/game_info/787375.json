This is a new ZX Spectrum\u00a0update\u00a0of Sparklers\u2019 1985 budget release Smudge &amp; The Moonees.</p>\n<p>Smudge is a jetpack-powered chimney sweep in the French town of Le Crelle, a town with curiously British-sounding street names. The original\u00a0picked up 3/10 in Your Sinclair who described it as a \u201cload of old Gallics\u201d.</p>\n<p>This version features prettier graphics and smoother gameplay while painstakingly adding new\u00a0flaws into the mix.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Smudge can be controlled with keyboard or joystick.</p>\n<ul><li>Q:\u00a0Up</li><li>A: Down</li><li>O: Left</li><li>P: Right</li><li>SPACE: Exit a screen</li><li>G: Pause</li><li>T: Quit</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Sweep the chimneys of each screen in turn, returning to the Laundrette after each screen to clean up and recharge. To sweep a chimney, simply drop onto it using your jetpack.</p>\n<p>When you've cleared the level, you must\u00a0head to Buck House, the Mayor's residence (why?\u00a0Don't ask difficult questions!). The long final street of Le\u00a0Crelle\u00a0mirrors the screen layout of the original.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T16:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64dac457b0190b47a511e761c5737387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Clebin Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
