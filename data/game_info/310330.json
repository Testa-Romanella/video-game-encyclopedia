You know you just gotta do something for Halloween. I originally really wanted to make a 42 kilobyte NES game. But as you can see it did not turn out as a 42 kilobyte NES game. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND A CONTROLLER TO PLAY. This game will get really difficult if you don't have a controller. Some things may look useless in the game like candy, but I made this game for kids to play on Halloween. So they can when actual candy when playing the game. You don't have to do that but I guess you can if you want to. This game is also procedural generated, so if something happens in a glitch, which I think I covered most of them, you can just hit the reload button on your keyboard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/03462dcd5835cafe65de05df4d5338e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PlugWorldG"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
