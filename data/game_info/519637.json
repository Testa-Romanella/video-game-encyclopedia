I decided to expand upon the game and work on it as a long-term project. This version is built from scratch, so it is more optimized, and I should be able to do a lot more with it.</p>\n<p>LOOP is a 1-bit platformer, with the main mechanic being looping around the edges of the screen. Traverse the endless void, where areas seem to infinitely repeat themselves. The space you continue to loop through may become a pathway to a different area. Is there a way out of the void?</p>\n\n<p><em>LOOP is a project that I will be working on for a while. There are many new areas I have planned, with different mechanics that will make them interesting. The version currently available is only the first area, and as such, does not have most of the content currently planned. If you want to watch and help the game grow, you can try out new versions as they come out and give me feedback. Whether it's a bug report or you have suggestions for changes I could make, any feedback is welcome, so don't hesitate to let me know!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T06:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38e/38e6e579f5faa5718d9e9013b6a8bfc4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue05"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
