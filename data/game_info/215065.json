We were 2 game designers on the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to make the blue bar on the left reach the green circle in the middle of the screen. To do so, you will have to enter several code combinaison in order to move the bar.</p>\n<p>A numeral code composed of 0 and 1 will appear on top of the screen.</p>\n<p>You have to memorize it and to enter it in the black box on the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>Remember that when you press the enter key to validate the code, the blue bar must face a blue part of the different circles that the level is composed of. Otherwise, if the blue bar moves to a red area, it's game over.</p>\n<p>Every code must be remembered. It means when you validate the first one, and when the second one appears on the screen, you have to enter both of them (the 1st code, and the new one)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e84d4b8064c037a432ac8d72892687.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nyare69"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
