It's time to party! ^.^ </p>\n<p><strong>!!! Early Access Beta Test !!!</strong></p>\n<p>Party Paws isn't finished yet, so come help me squash bugs and make it as fun as possible! You can grab a copy now, and join the beta test to help shape the development of the game.</p>\n<p>Throughout the beta (and after the final release) I'll be adding more minigames for you to play. The current version is also lacking any music, which is something I'm on the lookout for.<br/></p>\n<p>Join the discord server! \ud83d\udcac Party Paws Discord \ud83d\udcac You can use it to report bugs and chat about the gameplay, sharing your victories and discussing the best tactics for each minigame.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>What is Party Paws?<br/></strong></p>\n<p>It's a local multiplayer party game for up to 8 players, that's played using just 1 controller. It's fast-pased, frantic, and focussed! Players' turns are shuffled for each game, so you have to be ready to grab that controller at any moment, and the turn length is short, promoting frantic gameplay as you rush to grab as many points as you can.</p>\n<p>The game is made up of a number of minigames, each designed to play with your reaction times. They're simple to learn, using a maximum of three controls each: an analogue stick, and the A and B buttons. Just dive in, whether you're a hardened gamer or a new player who's never held a controller before.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Controller</strong></p>\n<p>Party Paws was built for sharing. The more players, the more fun it is! With up to 8 players passing around one controller it's designed to get crazy. Keep watching for your turn, and be ready to dive in at any moment.<br/></p><p>The game takes away any illusions of control you may have, deciding which characters you'll be, what minigame you're playing, the turn order, and even the length of your turns! Everything is run through random generators, so there's no arguments over who got the best character, or who's turn it is with the controller. There's also no scoreboard, so it's all or nothing. One winner, and then everyone else basking in their glory.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controller Support</strong></p>\n<p>The game was developed using a Steam Controller, but thanks to Unity's new input system, it supports most controllers you throw at it. Be aware that the controls' names may differ from the on-screen prompts. It's usually A and B, but on a Playstation controller it'll be X and O. There's also keyboard controls built in, but I reccommend a controller as it's easier and safer to pass around while playing.</p>\n<p><strong>Installing the Game</strong></p>\n<p>Once you've downloaded the zip folder, you can extract the files and filders inside. You'll need to keep them together, but you can put them wherever you want. The .exe is the one you'll want a shortcut to to actually launch the game. It's a good idea to add it to Steam if you're using a Steam Controller. That way, you can use the standard gamepad setup instead of the default mouse/keyboard emulation setup that's used outside of Steam.</p>\n<p><strong>Steam Artwork Pack</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside the game files, you can also download a zip folder of artwork designed for the Steam library. If you've added Party Paws to Steam, you can use these files to brighten it up and make it look like any other Steam game. Its card in your library will be blank when you add it. Right click on it and go to 'manage &gt; set custom artwork'. The file 'Steam Capsule' is designed to fit here. If you click on its cover, you'll see its page has no banner at the top. Right click there and pick 'set custom background'. The file 'Steam Hero' fits here. Right click and pick 'set custom logo'. The file 'Steam Logo' goes here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T05:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/823372bea9c495fe442aa1a6e22357b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["estragonhelmer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
