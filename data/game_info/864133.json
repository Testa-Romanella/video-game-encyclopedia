This color is invisible to this player.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Choice can be changed by clicking on a blurred color.</p>\n<p>When you decide that this color is yours, you can start a game. A screen with colors assigned to players will be shown.</p>\n<p>Now you can play. Your color in front of the player icon means that now is your turn to drop the token into the column \u2013 the column will be highlighted when you hover a mouse over it. And you can try to achieve the main purpose of the game. During the whole competition, you can exit from the game, go back to the menu or retry the game. All of these buttons are visible after clicking on the menu button that is placed in the bottom right corner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When one of the players drops four tokens of their own color to the horizontal, vertical or diagonal line, the game will be ended and information about the winner will be displayed on a screen.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T06:51:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/8195d4265c27826eb65ca01df884c55a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RabBit1.0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
