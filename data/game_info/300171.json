Always wanted to play it with a friend in coop? Do you ever thought that it will be fun to have a versus mode?\u00a0</p>\n<p>ASTEROID2\u00a0TOGETHER is a fan game made by Madwolf Studios as an homage to the 40th anniversary of Asteroids. The base game is a clone of the original with some minor differences, like some adjustments to the overall pace of the game and some changes in sound design. Where it actually makes a difference is that the game allows for actual 2 player mode (cooperative, not just by turns). Then, the game converts into a chaotic experience where shots and ships will fly all over the screen! Then, you can try the PVP mode, a little game mode where you'll fight 1v1 with your buddy to see who's a better captain!</p>\n<p>If the original game was fun, you will\u00a0<strong>love</strong> this version!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The same experience as the original game if you want it!</li><li>A cooperative mode!
