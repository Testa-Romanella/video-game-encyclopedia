In RoR you are tasked with solving puzzles and cracking codes in order to help you \u2018remember\u2019 a code phrase which will allow you to escape the Room.</p>\n<p>To win you\u2019ll need to find 3 words to say to the guards to allow you out. This game uses cryptic ciphers and puzzles so I would recommend making notes and there are no red herons.</p>\n<p>P.S. The input box is used to set tv signal, input the computer password and give the passcode to the guards.</p>\n<p>P.P.S I\u2019d recommend making the cipher wheel your self.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:59:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65b/65b9cc64e705ad32f6768aa936fb415b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rondam Goreman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
