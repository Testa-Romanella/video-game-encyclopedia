One pod malfunctions, leaving Dr. Ned Leben to go insane on board a lonely, isolated ship - turning to mutilating and \u2018upgrading\u2019 himself. After waking the other passengers to play a game of \u2018cat and mouse\u2019, Dr Leben activates your stasis pod. It is your turn to outwit him and escape his horrific legion of robotic monstrosities. Escape the Dr by locking doors to slow him down - and shut other enemies out.</p>\n<p>Created as a student project.<br/></p>\n<p>Programmer: Antoine Odi</p>\n<p>Game Designer: Georgia Bryant</p>\n<p>Artists: Adam Douglas, Tim Berry-Porter,\u00a0 Tyler Ellul</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:03:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cd218de574557bff832e3d50016368f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BryantG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
