Obviously, this is best achieved by breeding lots of animals and growing lots of plants\u2026 And then genetically modifying them to become mutated, snail eyed, flatulent monstrosities. Makes sense, right? With multiple game-play styles and millions of variations of mutated animals to pick from, the player can personalise their farm to suit their preferences. Annoyed by that fox that keeps stealing your chickens? Well, it wouldn't steal a chicken that could breath fire now, would it? This is just the tip of the iceberg in the crazy little game that is Mendel's Farm. Oh, and watch out for UFOs\u2026\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis early access version contains a fun tutorial on how to play as well as the free play mode option. Selectively breed and mutate four types of animals, as well as five types of crops, whilst building and upgrading your farm. Research new technologies, complete daily missions and challenges, and unlock achievements as you build your own unique and wacky farm of mutants! </p><p>\r\n\tThis is not a final product - it is an early access version, intended to give a general impression of the game's intent. This product is subject to change, including but not limited to, bug-fixing, gameplay, graphics and music, amongst others.</p><p>\n<strong>Contact Us Through</strong></p><p>info@static-games.co.uk | \r\n\tFacebook | Steam | Twitter | Youtube\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Developed By Static Games</strong></p><p>Robin Humphreyies - Managing Director<br/>\r\n\tSimon Pugnet - Lead Programmer<br/>\r\n\tBrett Whitehead - Lead Artist<br/>\r\n\tRyan Pinfield - Gameplay and UI Programmer<br/>\r\n\tThomas TJ Matthews - Gameplay Programmer<br/>\r\n\tOwen Chapman - Graphics Artist<br/>\r\n\tDaniel Wrigley - Audio Engineer<br/>\n</p><p><strong>Minimum Recommended Specs</strong></p><ul><li>Windows XP SP3 (32-bit only), Windows Vista, or Windows 7</li><li>2.0+ GHz processor</li><li>2 GB system RAM</li><li>SM3-compatible video card</li><li>320MB free hard drive space</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c6/9c6cfda8467b2c84449320bcd45121df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Static Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
