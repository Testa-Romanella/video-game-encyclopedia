Events such as ambushes, mid-stage bosses and more can spawn during each stage, introducing a new objective when triggered and generously rewarding the player when completed.\r\n</p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p>Enemies in BroodStar are a variety of standard SHMUP enemies and some more \"confrontational\" ones. There will be quite a few that aren't afraid to get in your face and ruin your day. Enemies that spawn in \"Infected\" stages are even tougher than their normal counterparts, so watch out!\r\n</p>\r\nUpgrade Types\r\n<p>The Upgrades in BroodStar can vary from simple Stat Upgrades that power up your ship, to more advanced types that can grant you powerful Active Items,\u00a0Projectile Modifiers or Drone Companions. Most of the Upgrade modules will combine with eachother to create unique combos. There are a ton of combo possibilities so don't be afraid to experiment!\r\n\r\n</p>\r\nResearch System\r\n<p>The Research System will allow you to further power up your ship before each playthrough. Research points are obtained through picking up Modules of any kind and may be spent on any of the 3 available Research Trees: Offense, Defense and Utility.\r\n</p>\r\nSeed System\r\n<p>Each playthrough will have a unique string identifier that determines the generated content. Share this seed with your friends so they can experience the same crazy combos and hardships that you did!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T04:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8c/d8ca307411ec09cb8efe5ec57362de20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Razeal", "Mnots"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
