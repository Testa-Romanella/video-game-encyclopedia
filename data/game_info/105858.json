The magnets wither attract or repel metal crates scattered throughout the seven levels. Use them to squish the infestation of the red Punk Bugs but don't get hit yourself!<br/></p><p>This game was created during the Ludum Dare #32 Game Jam. Its theme was \u201cAn Unconventional Weapon\"</p><p>The collisions are a bit glitchy but the game is fully playable until the end. I tried to do my best to have the levels progressing in difficulty so that you learn the mechanic of the MagGun (thanks, Portal!) <br/> <br/><strong>Controls</strong>: <br/>W A D <br/> <br/><strong>Shooting magnets</strong><br/>\u2193 \u2191 (up, down) <br/> <br/><strong>Quit</strong><br/>Esc <br/> <br/><strong>Screenshot</strong><br/>F12 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b6682851b2cbeb65d053d0673483c3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Prophecy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
