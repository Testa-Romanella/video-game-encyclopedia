There are more enemies with \"advanced prediction\" now, trying to counter your movements and some extra surprises to spice up the challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome back to QUICKERFLAK!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T04:00:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c79008c4eae9f6408d627afa5cc6a23f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Walter Machado"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Walter Machado"], "esrb_rating": null}
