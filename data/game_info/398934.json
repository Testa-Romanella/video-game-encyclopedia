I'd love it if it did, would help me justify my time spent on this, but it doesn't. I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>\n<p>*Due to developer incompetence,\u00a0Gerlard's destination does not actually exist.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T03:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a20a5717dbbadec614e0e0e599d081.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fover"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
