After a few hours sleeping you wake up when you hear something fall. You check if your brother is fine, but hes not in his little cradle. It's dark, the light dont work, but you find a flashlight. You go check whats going on and find out that theres someone in the kitchen, everything is locked. Is this a theft? You're not sure. You decide to stay in your room, your objective is to escape, but here's the hard thing, you need to find a few parts. You take a paper and write everything just incase you forget (Remember!
