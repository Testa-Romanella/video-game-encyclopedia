Hoping to get them in next. Then I want to change the Player Projectile to Moon Cheese instead of Acorn. Then UI redesign if time.</p>\n\n<p><em>Design Modifications (ProBuilder, Dialogue System, Unity)</em></p>\n<p>- New dialogues and interactions</p>\n<p>- Revamped main menu with additional UI buttons and pages</p>\n<p>- A new, complete, cohesive, and interesting level with a story/gameplay centered around gathering clues to solve a mystery (with a little platforming and turn-based combat incorporated).</p>\n<p>// Goals: Make an image of the Clues you've\u00a0collected\u00a0pop-up when presenting your reasoning\u00a0to Dr. Cat. Depends on which combination of clues you have, a different interaction results in the final showdown.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Gameplay Modifications</em></p>\n<p>- Set up a Traffic Light Switch that turns a redlight to a greenlight and stops traffic flow.</p>\n<p>// Goals: Make it obvious whose turn (Player's turn? Enemy's turn?)\u00a0cause how much damage (pop-up text?)\u00a0due to which attacks (Skill name displayed and fade?).\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outside Assets</strong></p>\n<p><em>Asset Store</em></p>\n<p>Simple Street Props (Aikodex) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/simple-street-props-194706</p>\n<p>Low Poly Fence Pack\u00a0 (Broken Vector) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/low-poly-fence-pack-6166...</p>\n<p>Cartoon low poly tree (Create Smth) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/cartoon-low-poly-tree-21...</p>\n<p>Low Poly Cars (Broken Vector) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/low-poly-cars-101798</p>\n<p>Texture Pack Bricks 'n Blocks (GlowFpx Games) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/texture-pack-bricks-...</p>\n<p>Seamless Hand-Drawn Textures (Elder Crivelari Teixeira) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/tiles/seamless-hand-...</p>\n<p>Meshtint Free Chick Mega Toon Series (Meshtint Studio) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/meshtint-free-chick-...</p>\n<p>Farm Animals Set (Vertex Cat) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/farm-animals-set-97945#content</p>\n<p>Gold Coins (Devtoid) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/gold-coins-1810</p>\n<p>Modular Fantasy Bridges (Julien Tonsuso) - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/modular-fantasy-br...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T06:01:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/969/969c134007bcc9e4e6471488052eab0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["luongvy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
