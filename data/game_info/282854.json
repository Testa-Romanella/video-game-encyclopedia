It's that simple.<br/><br/>By default, the game is continuous rounds where everyone gets a random weapons (RPG, Laser, Grenade, C4, Bouncer, or Nuke) and 3 utility tools (grapple, thruster and drill), played on one of the 4 biomes, each with unique elements (eg. the Ice Cave is slippery, so you'll need your boost rocket to get up steeper slopes).<br/><br/>Each round only last about a minute and once any player is dead it's sudden death for everyone else, so all players can have non-stop fun.<br/><br/>Note that while the game allows you to play against a really stupid Drone, that's mostly just for laughs and practice. This game is intended to be played with friends in local multiplayer.<br/><br/>Gamepad controllers are fully supported and one player can play from a keyboard, for up to 5 players.<br/><br/>We're very keen to listen to discussions among players on the strengths and weaknesses of various weapons and tools, and the general concept of balance in the game (with such short rounds and random weapon assignment, some imbalance is fine provided every combination is sufficiently <strong>fun</strong>).
