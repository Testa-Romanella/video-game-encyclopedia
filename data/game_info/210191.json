It sound like something you'd hear when a dungeon door unlocks or when you find a clue. Use it for whatever you want, just credit me. I'd love some awesome donations too, but not required, although they DO keep me making this stuff. Ogg is free, wav is a dollar.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b641299a114c7418b067816fe6d761.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chloe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
