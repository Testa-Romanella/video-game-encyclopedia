Bon appetit!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-postmortem (6/18):</strong></p>\n<p>2 of the\u00a03 days of my jam were interrupted by (real) work, but\u00a0I'm proud of what I accomplished in such a short time. Plus I learned a ton from the experience. Including the importance of a good tutorial. I have a ton more ideas for the game, some that I already built or I'm in the process of building, so I expect to keep updating the game here and on GitHub.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>Do not learn from this project.
