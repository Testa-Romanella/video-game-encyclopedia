Your only goal is to make it to the end but it's just not that easy. Highway 8 is hostile...you'll get tired, hungry and thirsty. Your jeep will need fuel and parts. Everything you need can be found by searching but searching costs time. Will you risk it to make it to the end?\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Design</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHighway 8 has been designed as a kind of digital toy. It's ideal for running when you want to game but you also need to pay attention elsewhere at the same time. Or you don't want people to know you're gaming ;)\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHighway 8 has no sound whatsoever. This may sound wierd but Highway 8 is not designed to take up 100% of your attention- it's not a 40 hour epic...just a minutes-long digital thing that is simple but challenging and infinitely repeatable.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tGood luck!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Features</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>low intensity gameplay</li>\n<li>neat user interface</li>\n<li>survival simulation</li>\n<li>three tiers of challenge</li>\n<li>no sound (Parents, Students in lectures, people on the phone)</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Requirements</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Windows 32-bit or 64-bit <strong>OR</strong> Mac OSX Yosemite</li>\n<li><strong>openGL</strong> - compatible graphics card (some Intel integrated graphics chips will not be able to display this game properly; making the game unplayable) </li>\n<li><strong>minimum</strong> screen resolution <strong>1280 * 720 </strong>pixels.
