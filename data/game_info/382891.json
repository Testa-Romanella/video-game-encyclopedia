I had a lot of ambitious ideas for this, but with the time constraints of a 48 hour game jam this is... more of an experimental proof-of-concept. There is a win condition of sorts, but I didn't have time to put in enough content to actually expect anyone to figure out much of the language. You don't *need* to understand much to find the end, but I still don't know if anyone will be able to beat it without absurd amounts of trial and error. If you try it, please let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>I put a lot of work into the alien language for this; its alphabet, vocabulary, and even grammar are unique and not based on any existing language. Although, again due to the short timeframe, some of the translations are a bit sloppy. Some of it is a bit more English-like than it should be.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm not sure if I'll update this game after the jam, but I do plan on incorporating this idea into a bigger game in the future. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T03:33:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9cd62d81c38b384498794f85cda9650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Thoughtquake"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
