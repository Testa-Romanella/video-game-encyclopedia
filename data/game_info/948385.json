From the start, I knew I wanted to play with lighting, cameras and the terrain tools; so I decided to make a \"playground\" scene for my character, Roxy, that had kind of a retro and gloomy feeling. I imported the playground assets and modified the materials to fit the color palette\u00a0I picked and created the ground terrain on Photoshop.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to take this assignment a bit further and play with a camera switch script that would allow the game view to switch between first and third person.</p>\n<p>There is no concrete objective to this game, just to walk around and explore the terrain! My favorite thing to do is climb the mountains by jumping-- finding a surprise at the highest mountain (spoiler: a flag). Another thing I enjoyed was walking into the slide off to the side of the mountain.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Assets used:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Skybox:\u00a0<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-l...</li></ul></li><li>Roxy Character and animations:<ul><li>https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&amp;query=amy</li></ul></li><li>Playground and tree assets:\n<ul><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/9t5-low-poly-playground-1025...</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T08:31:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709f4e0027d438cfb6f6d0db1924a0d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mjgomsa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
