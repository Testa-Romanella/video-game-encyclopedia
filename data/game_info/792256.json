Thankfully a UFO passing by has the light to guide the way back home.</p>\n<p>Use WASD and the arrows to control Spot and the Light! Having both controls on one keyboard means that you can guide Spot home solo or team up with a friend. Download the game for a surprise at the end!</p>\n<p>This game is in development, I'd like to push it as far as possible and make a complete game for people to enjoy.
