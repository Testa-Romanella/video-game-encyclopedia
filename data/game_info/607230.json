Do you have what it takes to be a Samurai master? Run through the meadows and dodge as many ninja stars as you can, if you get hit you will perish and your mission will come to a halt. Only a true Samurai can thrive in these dangerous meadows!\u00a0This game is still currently in development and I plan on adding more features to this game in the future.\u00a0This was a simple game to develop and was pretty straight forward. Follow me for future games and check out my collection. Feel free to drop a comment and rating on how the game was.\u00a0I hope you enjoy my game.
