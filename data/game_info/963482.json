However, utilizing Kazu\u2019s unique counter ability, you are able to mitigate and reverse damage back to enemies.  Play as Kazu, the Finnish Spitz, and master his unique counter ability to annihilate waves of foes.  The more enemies there are, the more potential damage you are able to counter and deal back.  The fluid reactionary combat keeps you engaged on the enemy's turn.<br/><br/><br/><strong>COUNTER ENEMY ATTACKS AND DEAL MASSIVE DAMAGE</strong><br/>Perfectly timed swaps enable you to reduce incoming damage and deal significant damage to all enemies.  If the returned damage was not already enough, you also generate a flood of Aether to set up a high damaging spellcasting turn.  Like they say, the more enemy attacks, the merrier!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>CAST POWERFUL SPELLS TO DEFEAT FOES</strong><br/>Spells do not trigger enemies to retaliate.  Spam skills to your hearts content, however remember to save sufficient energy such that you are still able to swap counter!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-17T03:47:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/647364f499dbfeb1a86902fac4d49353.jpg", "website": "https://www.kazumigames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kazumi Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kazumi Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
