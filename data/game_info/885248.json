It is about a gigantic deforming T-posing anime girl throwing fishes and hearts at you. Your goal is to catch them. You move with WASD and the mouse. It's a first person game. You know how to play first person games.<br/></p>\n<p>When a girl throws hearts at you that means she likes you (probably), so you want to catch them. When a girl throws fishes at you that means she doesn't like you (trust me, I speak from experience), but fish is still tasty, so you might want to catch some of them as well, as long as you don't catch too much. You can do this for 20 seconds. Your score is calculated according to the formula</p>\r\nscore = cos(pi*(f-0.611f*h))+((h-18.1f)^2)-((11.3f-f)^2) +3*h-f)\r\n<p>where <em>f</em> is the number of fishes you catch and <em>h</em> is the number of hearts you catch.</p>\n\n<p>The game was made with unity3d. The music was made in Logic Pro by ya boi.
