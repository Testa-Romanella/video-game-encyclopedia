It has 8 stages total, and each one shows an aditional rule or new feature.</p>\n<p>- This is a turn based game, which when you walk, you also shoot a bullet.<br/>- You can use WASD or the key arrows to walk and shoot.<br/>- Everyone's turn happens at the same time.<br/>- You can't walk if you're out of ammo.<br/>- To recharge your ammo, press Space or Enter. This will also pass a turn.<br/>- Kill all enemies to clear a stage.\u00a0<br/>- If you die in the process or kill an innocent, it's Game Over.<br/>- The less turns you take to clear a stage and the less ammo you waste, the better.</p>\n<p>- You can also pass the mouse over everything to read its description.<br/>- Enemies and Innocents show where their Routes on their descriptions.<br/>- If you use your mouse's scroll, you can zoom in and out a level.<br/>- Press Esc to open the menu.</p>\n<p>The project was made in Unity and everything (code, art, level design, ...) was made by me, Jos\u00e9 Estev\u00e3o Pinto de Oliveira.
