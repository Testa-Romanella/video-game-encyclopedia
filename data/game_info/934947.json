What does the following of your passion entail in a world of myriad possibilities? What pressures and attitudes must Maria endure from her surroundings?\u00a0What is the utopian state of Ineria like and who lives there?\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>In Menial you:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Make and serve your clients the best bagels using the Bagel Simulator, or just don't give them what they want; you don't have to worry about income, after all.\r\n</p>\n<p>Learn about Ineria and it's citizens by discussing with your clients: get into arguments, help a man remember his fantastic travels, befriend a hiking botanist and her girlfriend. Travel around the city to different bagel stands.\r\n</p>\n<p>Help Maria start her day and open the bagel stand with some light puzzles.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gamble that hard earned cash or go shopping.\r\n</p>\n<p>Read the news to be up to date with worldly events.\r\n</p>\n<p>Dream to peek into Maria's head.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Use LMB to interact and RMB to walk.\r\n</p>\n<p>Open inventory with 'i'.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use ESC to quit the game.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to leave a comment about any impressions you've got about the game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T09:42:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d2/2d2954f7a55890497f08436057964daa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wavey Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
