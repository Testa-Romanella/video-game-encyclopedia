This is my submission for Fragment Jam\u00a0 (https://itch.io/jam/fragmentjam)<br/></p>\n<p>This is a souls like first person shooter\u00a0with a low poly western/science fiction aesthetic. This is the final part of a short game jam series which has finally been finished.\u00a0The goal is to have the story line run\u00a0\u00a0across all three episodes to slowly piece it all together. This game has the character beating three bosses to reach the end game.</p>\n<p>I hope you all have fun!
