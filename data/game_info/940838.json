{"id": 940838, "slug": "monster-mastermind-imagine-create-fight", "name": "Monster Mastermind: Imagine, Create, Fight", "name_original": "Monster Mastermind: Imagine, Create, Fight", "description": "<p><strong>This project is a prototype that is not actively supported or in active development.</strong></p><p>Evolve your monsters, customize your world, and fight to survive!</p>\n<p>Fight your creations, collect them and explore a procedurally generated world, that you can change to your liking. Not only by building structures and crafting, but by creating and changing layers of a 2D top-down world. Create as many Monsters, Monster Types and Actions as you want and balance everything to your liking.</p><p>In the finished game, you will start with a random low-level Monster and will need to keep it alive. It is the only thing protecting you from aggressive wildlife. Build structures to make yourself a home and have a safe place to rest. Survive and thrive!<br/></p>\n<p>Battle other Monsters in a turn-based battle, by choosing the right actions at the right time. Level up your Monsters and even let them evolve into other Monsters.</p>\n<p>Customization: For the most part, you can use the built-in package editor. For including textures, you just drag them into the package subfolder, which you can open easily via a button. Change the import settings in the text file that is automatically created in the folder where the pictures are stored.</p>\n<p>You can have multiple packages active and combine them to your liking.</p>\n<p>You can also deploy the Base Package that comes with the game. There will be a prompt to deploy it on first start up. It is also possible to deploy the Base Package again from within the Package Editor.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>For now, I have deactivated the Open World in the current Alpha Build. It will maybe come online at a later stage of development when it is more feature-complete. Until then, you can already start creating Monsters and test them in battle. You can do this by clicking on \"Custom Monster Battle\".</strong></li><li><strong>There are currently no sounds in the game beside some Background-Music. This may also come at a later stage.</strong></li><li><strong>This is an early prototype. Feedback is welcome. The Game will likely not be free at later stages of the development. The last free game version will be kept online here so that you can continue playing the game you may already\u00a0have created packages for.</strong></li><li>The Game is not polished. You may encounter game breaking bugs.</li></ul>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3c70af9c9dab5ae0030302087a341b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Housebird Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
