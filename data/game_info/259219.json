(These AND the in-game ones.)</p>\n<p>In level 2 the car will veer to the right a little. The first, long bend to the left is hard, but after that the level is quite easy. Slow down if the slider goes too far to the left, speed up if it's getting to the right. If you come of the path the car will probably stop working but that happens in real life too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tip for the last boss - he will spawn near the level start (I did it that way to stop people avoiding the enemies there the whole level) after the sound effect. Start shooting him straight away because he gets a stacking speed buff over time that is reduced by being shot. He DOES take damage from your bullets. Before you need to reload make sure to get some distance from him.</p>\n<p>All sound effects taken from creative commons 0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/719246f37172ac7b269bc639b9d180da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dorthonion"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
