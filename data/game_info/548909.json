You control Mauve, a man with pale white skin, on a quest to bring a young individual from a race of robots to a sacred ground where you give them a better body like you promised them.</p>\n<p>To be able to witness this program, you require the ability to use the arrow keys to control your character and move through the menus, whilst having to be able to use the <strong>Z </strong>and <strong>X </strong>keys alongside the shift key for other actions.</p>\n<p><em>This is just a project I did for fun in order to like, I dunno, get out of mental block or something. The game's also just less than 2 hours including all the side quests.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:34:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b222b94116b63c3bd2d32d01aa30966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kiyopawn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
