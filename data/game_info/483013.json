A text-based ancient-egyptian life simulation with a twist.\r\nWhat did I do with the limitation?\r\nMy intention was to make it a combination of text-adventure and a first-person shooter game since these two conflict with each other. One purely relies on text while\u00a0the other is mostly action and is full of flashy guns.\r\n\n<p><em>** The game might be buggy at some points so sorry in advance, I'll try to fix them and I'll be updating the game during voting.**</em></p>\r\nCreator's Experience:\r\n<p>Thank the game dev gods I submitted. This is is my 3rd jam ever and the shortest one I've had. I'm definitely not the first one to make a game with a shooting text gameplay, I took inspiration from the class trials in danganronpa where you literally slice and shoot the words. Also, I'm not at all familiar with text-based or fps games so I pretty much\u00a0 just guessed how I would combine them all together.\u00a0</p>\r\nNote:\r\n<p>The game may suffer from lack of playtesting so\u00a0if you've got any suggestions, questions or errors you encountered in the game, comment them below.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T02:48:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/602/60213d2d705683440f08ba79f212975f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["glas"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
