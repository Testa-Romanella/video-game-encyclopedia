It is a game to accompany any interactions where you can have a conversation: it can be played in person, over a\u00a0video-call or even over text messages!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rules are simple, <strong>try and complete the different tasks to the best of your ability</strong>!</p>\n<p>If you complete them, then you get points according to the tasks difficulty. However, if someone who is also playing the game says \u201c<em><strong>Tell me about it!</strong></em>\u201d while you are trying to complete a task, you lose that task! If you run out of current tasks they refill. The accomplishment of tasks are upheld via the honour system, or debates if that suits your fancy and the points are for bragging rights.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We recommend playing this game with friends over a longer period of time, a couple hours, a couple days or even a couple weeks. The longer you play, the more time you get to set up your mischievous plans and trick your friends to earn those sweet sweet points.</p>\n<p>Play with our rules or add some rules of your own to further spice up the game, its your choice! For example, you can add a penalty for saying \u201c<strong><em>Tell me about it!</em></strong>\u201d too much, or even add a prize for the top scorer!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This is a game, but you might just end up having a great conversation.</p>\n<p>- Martin, Oliver &amp; Giorgos</p>\n\n<p>This is a research project.\u00a0<br/>If you want to help us out, please complete this survey after playing the game:\u00a0https://giorgospetkakis.typeform.com/to/Zni8do</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db85f8434d6cfb0a73b7badb973d127a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Giorgos Petkakis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
