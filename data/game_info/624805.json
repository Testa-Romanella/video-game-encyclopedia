This project is called Mafia: Miami Drug Wars and I created this by gaining influences from some of my favourite sources of media. Such as my favourite film Scarface and one of my favourite games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. In this project I wanted to represent my skills within game documentation through an in-depth game design document and my level design skills and techniques that I had learnt through the research I produced throughout this project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T04:31:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c5b61d766dbca693949c948231c00f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liampullin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
