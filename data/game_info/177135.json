Also the music is temporary for now until I figure out how to make it better.\r\n<p> \u00a0 \u00a0Killbot is a sort of arcadey styled wave based platformer. The goal is pretty simple prove your superiority to other similar looking robots, and defeat all the bosses.</p>\n\n<p>The game is simple but pretty decent for killing time. It starts off fairly easy actually, and grows in difficulty as you progress.</p>\n\n<p>As the current copy of the game is basically a demo it is almost complete and it is missing a few things the final version will have.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>W\u00a0\u00a0 - Switch Ammo Type</li><li>S \u00a0 \u00a0  - Switch Ammo Type</li><li>A \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Move Left</li><li>D \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  - Move Right</li><li>Space - Jump</li><li>E - Fire</li><li>Escape - Typically return.</li></ul>\n<p>The final version is planned to have:</p>\n<ul><li>A few more enemy types ( an engineer that places mines, and thumper bots that generate shockwaves when falling down )</li><li>Pickups dropped from enemies ( to keep you up when your low on ammo )</li><li>Explosives ( the implementation is present but animations need to be made )\u00a0<strong>Done.</strong></li><li>Potentially more levels (Don't count on this one)</li><li>Melee attacks for the player.</li><li>A few more bosses.</li></ul>\n<p>As well as some missing things like a pause menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong>As of right now a demo / preview of the game is avaliable.

I am Xpost2000, I play Dark Souls and other types of RPGs and video games. I also wanted to learn game development. So for the last two years or so I've learned how to program video games. Up until this I've never produced anything I considered worthy enough. That's basically my whole message.\u00a0Now despite this\u00a0<strong>I want you to give me good criticism despite this.</strong> I will be honest though as it is my first time I don't know how to react, but I will attempt to be as professional as I\u00a0can be with it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting this project page, thank you for reading, and thank you if you decided to play this game :)</p>\n<p>Also since this is a prerelease version I would like to emphasize <strong>please report any bugs you find! It would be very appreciated!</strong><br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee9a4493b4d779023c4dc2c3ca67e2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xpost2000"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
