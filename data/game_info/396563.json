Collect flies to gain lives and avoid the hazardous flora at all costs!</p>\n<p>Length: 5 - 120 minutes</p>\n<p>Keyboard only: can use arrow keys or WASD</p>\n<p>The game has only been tested on Windows so far</p>\n<p>This is my first game, made in about 2.5 weeks. Although I call it a demo, there will not be a longer version of this build; I plan to remake the game from the ground up once I gain more experience with coding and pixel art. My hope is to turn it into a full-fledged metroidvania with at least a few hours of content.</p>\n<p>The little tune I made for the game is also included as a free download.</p>\n<p>All comments and criticisms are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T04:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/555/555e01b26fc1b20629c0c026cbb4a34b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eye of Entropy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
