Inspired by retro games like Galaga and Space Invaders, you pilot an experimental spaceship capable of rotating enemy ships' bullets and firing them back. Can you beat all seven levels? (You're not supposed to be able to)<br/></p><p>\u00a0Starship Hannele - An experimental ship with the ability to make other ships' bullets orbit around it.</p> Scorpion Starships - Standard galactic military vehicles. Capable of shooting average alpha-ray torpedos.<br/> Butterfly Starships - Slightly newer starship model compared to the Scorpion class. The heat-resistant shell allows it to shoot especially hot gamma-ray plasma torpedos. These torpedos are hot enough to melt through the hull of a starship - coming out the other end ready to destroy another ship. Elephant Starships - These starships are renowned around the galaxy for their tough hides, much like their Terran namesakes. Even against a Butterfly's plasma torpedos, it takes at least two shots to destroy these mighty beasts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:35:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb298a04fd32796e5e1910bc8c0dbddd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alexio Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
