The bigger fireball deals more damage and can damage multiple humans at the same time, but you only have 10 per round.</p>\n<p>Sun Power has four different themes and has several comic strips drawn by me.</p>\n<p>This game was made about 10 years ago by me and was the first game I have ever developed. I created all assets myself.</p>\n<p>The game is about half an hour to an hour long.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T03:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/77531c21adff69e5dbd77768e69b8f07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KaaaaasKop"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
