Due to the severe time constraint I was initially thinking of making a Twine game or implementing Gemedet (the D'ni board game) but I ran a Twitter poll to see what you thought, and you picked the third option, \"a 3D age.\" So here is my crappy 2-day attempt at making a 3D age, based off of an age I made in Bryce3D when I was 12 years old, which shockingly looks better than my 27-year-old attempt. Tools, go figure. I kind of wish I had chosen Twine instead, this is very unfinished and therefore boring. It was a good learning experience at least, and I had fun (on the first day, at least.) There is a bit of content if you explore the library.</p><p>The Unity 5 source code is up on GitHub and might be of interest to somebody trying to make a Myst-y game. Feel free to look at it or play with it, but it's not under an open-source license (yet?) so you'll need to get my permission before publishing anything based off of it.</p><p>Don't use fullscreen unless it's set to native resolution, otherwise the GUI will be screwed up due to a bug in Unity 5.3.0.<br/><br/>It uses the following sounds from Freesound.org:</p><ul><li>Wind SoundEffect by Equality_X12 | License: Attribution</li><li>ocean-4.wav by xserra | License: Attribution</li><li>page turn by Mydo1 | License: Creative Commons 0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae5/ae5aaf8ea66a8d1ba5d69e82c56ecce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eliot Lash"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
