As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.</p>\n<p>There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</p>", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2001-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-05T21:38:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/caed8a3e2b4bc85d4ebd75ded8756d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Dreamcast"], "developers": ["CSK Research Institute"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Crave Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
