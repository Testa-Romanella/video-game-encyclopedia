The theme song for the game is &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is the fifth game in the NASCAR series of video games, and is the first of the series to have a new title (the other games simply read &quot;NASCAR&quot;, followed by the year). Notably, it is the first NASCAR game to feature alternate paint schemes on the cars. It featured the 2001 Cup Series Champion Jeff Gordon on its cover and 2000 Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte on the disc.<br />\nNASCAR Thunder 2002 was the first NASCAR game released for the Xbox and the second released for the PlayStation 2. Game modes consist of Create-a-car, Quick race, Season mode, Career mode, and practice. Before every race, the player has the option to qualify for a position at the start of the race, get to know the track in practice, or &#39;race&#39; other cars in Happy Hour. The game has 35 drivers from the 2001 Winston Cup season (minus Dale Earnhardt due to his death, but the game has many tributes to him including a black No. 3 screen on start-up) and several then-Busch Series and fantasy drivers that can be unlocked.<br />\nThe PlayStation version was separate from the PS2 and Xbox versions, included only 36 drivers, and included an instant-replay feature, fantasy tracks, and only 18 drivers per race, and all of the alternate paint schemes were removed. A system of power-up/cheat cards and challenges, similar to Chase/Thunder plates and Lightning/Dodge Challenges in later editions, was a major game mode in this version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-24T01:18:44", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 15, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "PlayStation", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Tiburon"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
