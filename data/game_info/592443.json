The wizard can also dash in the direction he's aiming by pressing the <strong>left shift </strong>key. <br/></p>\n<p>When you kill an enemy he starts blinking during this state you can dash into him in order to regain health.<br/></p>\n<p>While playing the monolith will chant <strong>words of power </strong>that you can write in your spell book, that you can open by pressing the <strong>tab </strong>key. These words grant you new powers that you can combine with a rune, by <strong>dragging and dropping </strong>them into a solt, next to the word of power text field. <br/></p>\n<p>The objective of the wizard is to kill all the demons of the level, before the time runs out. The game has 3 levels. <br/></p>\n<p>Yes, the game has bugs, and yes, it also has no audio.\r\nThe gamejam had a duration of one week and the participants had to combine these two themes: <strong>high speed </strong>and <strong>ASCII</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer's note</strong>:\u00a0 <em>I was afraid the game was to easy, so I accidentally made it way to hard, i'm pretty sure the last level is impossible to beat</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:33:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39c44d0737287c9cff8faef62b3ab33e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wyvex"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
