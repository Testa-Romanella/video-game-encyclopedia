Guide Emma through four everyday situations (and one not so common) and complete her To Do List while ensuring her stimulation meter does not overflow.</p>\n<p>Navigate the menus with a click.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Use the A&amp;D buttons to move, the space button to interact, and the alt button to engage in a conversation. I know this is all discussed in the tutorial level, but I want to put it here anyways.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Please note: this does not perfectly emulate life with a sensory processing disorder, nor does it emulate my situation. If it did, the game would take 30 times as long and not be fun for anyone. I made this to start a conversation in a (hopefully) fun way.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Also, while I have released this game, there are three more levels in the works. Not to mention more mechanics and features that hopefully don't get scrapped.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T19:53:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/136/136550e602e5540b9d33364fe1e6260b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CometCreations"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
