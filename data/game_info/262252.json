Design, coding, art, sound, level design etc. etc.  by Mr Tom of Bee Bush Games.<br/></p>\n<p>This was a game I've spent a lot of my spare time creating, but I eventually had to come to the decision to drop the project as I realised the amount of work needed to create enough content (read: levels, more level tilesets, sound, visual effects and so on) was just too great considering I'm just a hobbyist with a full-time job and family commitments.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong> HOW TO PLAY </strong></p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to complete each level by destroying all of the grey blocks, causing the exit to become active. The number of blocks remaining is displayed in the upper-left corner of the screen. SPID can only shoot when anchored to special background spaces which she can climb on, and she cannot be directly next to a block - there has to be at least half a space gap. Gems may be dropped when blocks are destroyed, but they are not necessary to complete the level.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are explained in game, but both keyboard and joystick are supported.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ea/5ea84e2b08183cf82b69e9e6279024dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bee Bush"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
