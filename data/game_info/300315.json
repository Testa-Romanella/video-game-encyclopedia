So I spent far too long taking a picture of it. My wife made fun of me for that so rather than back down I\u00a0dug my heels in and spent even more time\u00a0making a song about it. Somehow that wasn't enough\u00a0time wasted by my brain, so now I've also made\u00a0a game about it. I'm still not sure why. Enjoy, maybe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d16ba888792338df42f42c903d89cce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spacedesk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
