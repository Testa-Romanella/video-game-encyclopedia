The 20th century is still young.<br/><br/>This is a world that experienced a 19th century very different from our own. A world of innumerable steam-powered Engines. The unnaturally rapid development of this steam civilization filled the air with smog, robbing humanity of the blue skies they'd once known.<br/><br/>There is one place in particular where the sky is darker than anywhere else: the ruins of the Engine city New York, perpetually shrouded in grey clouds and polluted rain. Five years ago, a mysterious disaster known as the \"Great Disappearance\" reduced this entire metropolis to a deserted, crumbling wasteland. Sealed off from the world by the United States government, it stands in utter silence. Not a single soul now walks its streets.<br/><br/>But today, a woman named Elysia quietly sets foot inside it - guided by a singular purpose. Her destination: old Manhattan, said to be the epicenter of the catastrophe.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to her...<br/><br/>There is a place said to be the city's \"Underground.\" This is an enormous subterranean realm, permeated with a dim purple light. No one on the surface world knows of its existence. In this place, the Skyscrapers that crumbled five years ago still stand tall; but their forms are warped and twisted.<br/><br/>\"Underground New York\" is a place of black and violet shadows. A prison with no exit. And beneath its unnatural \"sky,\" the men and women who vanished five years ago still exist...<br/>\tCowering in fear of the seven monsters known as the \"Messengers.\"<br/>\tSuffering terror, agony, and death at the hands of the \"Messengers.\"<br/>They linger on in this twisted underground city, as if waiting for something.<br/><br/>A girl named Lily sets foot in this place, her mind devoid of memories. There is only one thing she's certain of.She doesn't have a reason. She doesn't know who or what awaits her. She doesn't even know why she feels this way. But even so, she's absolutely certain.<br/><br/>\t\"Manhattan. The ends of the violet sky.\"<br/>\t\"I have to go there. I'm the only one who can.\"<br/><br/>\u2500The girl sets off for the tower of violet shadow looming far in the distance.<br/>\u2500With every step, she finds the shades of those yet to fade away.<br/>\u2500And sheds tears without knowing why.<h3>Features</h3>- Visual Novel with a mix of fantasy and the historical real world.<br/><br/>- Vividely drawn CGs to explore!<br/>- 25 hours of average reading time.<br/>- Developed by Liar-soft, acclaimed for their Steampunk series!<br/>- Written and directed by Hikaru Sakurai", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T11:26:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e17f9bc5a33df18a53a4b7d4d03d9816.jpg", "website": "https://www.mangagamer.org/sona-nyl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Liar-soft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
