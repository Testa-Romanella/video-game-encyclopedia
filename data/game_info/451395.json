Typically this is just a suggested speed - depending on your racing line, driving style etc you may be able to go faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:33:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ef/5efe6c6789fdd032cc190dc4681a20fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Tom Mulgrew"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
