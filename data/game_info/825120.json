It means a lot, and as a kid, it really helps me learn and grow my knowledge of game design so I can be a game developer one day. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>After peace was finally achieved between the red circles and red squares, civilization prospered. Eventually, revolutionary blue cybernetics and android technology allowed the first shuttle to be sent to the Cube: an alien planet. You play an android who was sent is the first mission, but the shuttle failed and you crash landed. Waves of hostile alien triangles are running at you, and what's more, your gun's power core that allows you to change its ammo type has completely broken, and now rolls like a dice, picking weapons at random. You cannot survive without the data sender nearby, but thankfully the aliens aren't attacking it. You have one goal: survive.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: shoot the green triangles, survive as long as you can, everything else in game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T19:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20e12e9936b706219c6ed8ea6025276e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eleventh_Lord"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
