Play as Gremlyn, the notorious\u00a0Halloween bandit venturing into the Crypt of Candy. But beware! The crypt is guarded by monsters with plenty\u00a0of\u00a0tricks up their sleeves.\u00a0You'll need to be just as fast and relentless as your foes to win the night!<br/><br/><em>Sugar &amp; Slice\u00a0</em>was created by a team of 14 people at ACM GameBuilders,\u00a0a student game studio at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It is an educational case study of <em>Hades\u00a0</em>by Supergiant Games\u00a0and takes inspiration from its game mechanics. Work on this project\u00a0took place between September 2022 and January 2023.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project represents the first effort by the studio to create a published game, and we are incredibly proud of the strides made by the team. The future looks promising!<br/></p>\n<p>Our sincere thanks to the members of the\u00a0team, whose collaboration and creative vision made this production possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a05b794e49efe503235a564b743d68e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameBuilders Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
