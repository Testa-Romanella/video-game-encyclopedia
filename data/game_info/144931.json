You keep progressing through obscure rooms, halls and areas passing the servants of darkness; Trying to solve the mysteries that are lying ahead of you. Will this nightmare ever end?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/>Focusing on the roots of classic horror games \"Clockwise\" uses the elements of darkness, sounds and visual trickery. The game can be played over and over again and never be exactly the same like it used to be before.</p>\n<ul><li>Dark atmosphere</li><li>Changing playthroughs</li><li>Classic riddles\u00a0</li><li>A lot of dynamic interaction</li><li>Best performance and look thanks to the Unreal Development Kit (UE3)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Some Background</strong><br/>I started this just because i wanted to create a small horror game for people to enjoy. It is hard nowadays to find good horror games that really live up to the expectations. Most just get stuck in development... stay a concept or a demo of some sort. That's why I decided a long time ago to make the world \"a better place\" and provide it with actually good horror games - Games that dont throw a jumpscare on you... play an overly loud sound... simply appear cheap and not well done.\u00a0<br/><br/>Some people may know the \"Wooden Floor\" - games by me. I wanted this game to be similar from the look - but different from the gameplay and feel - more simple and direct. The idea was to create something like the SCP-Games, that every horror fan should be familiar with... but it all became much bigger and better than intended. Me myself would call this my best work so far.</p><p><strong>The game is playable on both:\u00a032bit and 64bit-Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b0/0b020b2a7922c014b8ae6348c5561810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pheenix93"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
