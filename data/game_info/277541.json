To play, think of something... anything... then answer a series of twenty questions. If it guesses within twenty questions, it wins. If not, you win! It's hours of fun as you try to stump 20Q. Play alone or use your iPad's AirPlay feature for group play. Can you stump the \"all knowing\" artificial intelligence of 20Q?<br/><br/>You can play in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, and easily switch between languages.<br/><br/>Play 20Q!
