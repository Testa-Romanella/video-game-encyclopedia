{"id": 378196, "slug": "huggermugger", "name": "HUGGERMUGGER", "name_original": "HUGGERMUGGER", "description": "<p>In an unknown galaxy far far away there was a ferocious territory infested with crime, mischief and fraud. The intergalactic space police of <strong>Planet xD-13.37</strong> was trying their best to call a halt on the vastly expanding wave of robberies. As soon as things were clearly\u00a0escalating the government declared a state of emergency and commanded all available police units\u00a0to\u00a0raid each and every single one of\u00a0their primary suspects' hideouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>But not on your watch!</strong> Your Alien has put seventeen months into collecting all of its treasures. Took it quite a while for such little things, but your little friend is a rather slow and\u00a0clumsy one. And honestly, looking at that big pile of stuff hoarded in its' hideout, it all\u00a0mainly appears as a huge heap\u00a0of space junk - but beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyhow: <strong>All that stuff needs to be saved! </strong>Your Alien has strong big tentacles and it is going to use them. It has to balance all its things into its trusty space ship waiting further up, ready to warp\u00a0into freedom. But careful: If you fail, you'll be busted by the police in no time. So you better get your shit together and get the hell outta there!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Stack all the things on the Alien.\u00a0<br/>2. Make sure everything is balanced out.\u00a0<br/>3. Press [SPACE] and place balloons to lift off\u00a0and reach your ship.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you tilt, use more balloons for balance.\u00a0 <br/>4. Transfer as much items onto your ship as possible.\u00a0<br/>5. Enter the tractor beam and warp the fuck outta there!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:45:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4a/f4a8664f2f3f3b5e38840cf8993dfce7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["henningboat", "Phil", "maerran", "PetWussy91", "Apanathi", "lale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
