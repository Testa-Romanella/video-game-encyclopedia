Attackers spawn from the right of the screen, to place a defender, click on the defender (if active, based on the cost of the defender and how many coins you have.) and place the defender on the grid.  Do not let them pesky animals pass through, if 3 of them pass by before the time runs out you lose!</p><p>Tip : The trophy defender won't attack, but it generates coins for you. So make sure you don't let it die. ;)</p><p>Too easy?
