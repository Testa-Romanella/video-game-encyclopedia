Energy replenishes automatically when not consumed. The player can optionally collide with green objects and interact with the walls through them, or not collide with any objects, except for enemies and coins, of course. To go to the next level, you need to collect all the coins and find the portal.</p>\n\n<p>The game is made in Godot Engine</p>\n<p><strong>Free music from the site (opengameart.org) is used:</strong><br/>1) \"cave theme\" (By Brandon75689),<br/>2) \"GreenSalon\" (By Yubatake)</p>\n<p><strong>This game was made in 4 days for the gamejam</strong>\u00a0(https://dtf.ru/s/superjam)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:48:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/402e32dc5938673a6b551116286fcf26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wacyym"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
