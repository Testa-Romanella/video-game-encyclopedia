The game is a sequel to Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising,  and overall a third game in the series.<br />\nThe game\u2019s protagonists are a squad of four US Marine Corps soldiers, each with their unique skills and fighting capabilities. The main campaign focuses on a fictional conflict in the Middle East, featuring both single-player mode and cooperative multiplayer.  The battles in Operation Flashpoint are unique in a way that the players will feel the battleground, facing a real threat of getting their platoon killed, therefore making them plan their every step and use the surroundings to ensure victory.<br />\nWhile, the game lacks competitive multiplayer, due to its focus on realism and refined experience of a fast-paced military simulator, the cooperative experience will allow players to fully immerse themselves in what would seem like a real test of nerves, teamwork, and tactics.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2011-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T16:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/810/8100f945426cd77450ae0c62cffcb288.jpg", "website": "http://www.flashpointgame.com/", "rating": 2.68, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 78, "owned": 1708, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 56, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 45, "ratings_count": 82, "suggestions_count": 546, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 82, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Codemasters"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
