You play as each of 3 siblings until their death or until the game ends. If all of the siblings die, the game is over.<br/><br/>Marburgh started off as a project to build a very simple game in under 10 hours and has grown into a full fledged game. It is an attempt to evoke the old school BBS door game feel of Usurper, Exitilus and Legend Of Red Dragon while incorporating some newer game mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e0/5e040807b3cac586b58556d91a4b76e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcotte173"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
