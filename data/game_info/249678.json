But as soon as it was created it prospered, slowly eating up the world. The player serves Cantido, god of black flame, and must hinder Endsville's growth by setting it afire.\r\n</p>\n<p>Hide from the police and torch the city to purge it of devils. But you mustn't burn everything. If the entire city burns down, you will have no place to stay. You will not be able to live. There can be no final victory. The only thing you can do is burn and burn.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your only hope is Cantido's blessing, god of black flame.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Silverman: Programming, Game Design</li>\n<li>Say Mistage: Art, Publishing</li>\n<li>Marco Iannello: Music</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit our website here: https://www.silverwaregames.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/27263e69c45465490d3874b516e837d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Silverware Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
