Using the practice-led research methodology with Riel\u2019s action research model, this research builds on the experience-driven procedural content generation framework, to identify three principles for converting information gathered through player experience models into adaptive level generation. These principles help to illuminate the best practices for level designers and programmers by offering a guide for practitioners attempting to implement adaptive level generation\u2014steering them towards an efficient method that they can adapt for their own needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls while playing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD keys to move forward, left, backwards, and right.\r\n  </li><li>Aiming/Viewing: Move the camera/viewing angle by moving the cursor across the screen.\r\n  </li><li>Shoot: Shoot/Fire using the left mouse button.\r\n  </li><li>Melee: Sword attack with the E key.<br/>\n</li><li>Jump: Jump using the space bar.\r\n  </li><li>Reload: Reload using the R key.\r\n  </li><li>Drop: Drop using the V key.\r\n  </li><li>Swap Weapon: Swap weapons by using the scroll wheel or using 1 for the primary and 2 for the secondary.\r\n  </li><li>Ability: Use characters unique ability with the Q key.\r\n  </li><li>Debug: Open the debug console using the forward slash key (/).
