{"id": 317500, "slug": "waraira", "name": "Waraira", "name_original": "Waraira", "description": "<p>Waraira is a digital card game, designed to help people new to this type of game. In it, players use virtual creatures called \"Avatars\" to fight with one another. The main defining features of Waraira's gameplay are its simultaneous turns, as well as its effect arrows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unlike most card games, players both execute their turns at the same time, each with a time limit to decide their actions. Players get to place cards on their side of the field first, with their opponent unable to see. Afterward, both players reveal their side of the board and select which cards they will use, and where they'll attack. Finally, players then see their attacks play out at the same time; this continues until a player's health reaches 0. The system helps keep players continually strategizing; since they have 60 seconds to perform each of their actions.</p>\n<p>The second part if the Arrow Effects. Each card has arrows, which influence how their effects word once played on the board. Players activate their cards effects by using them to attack. When they do so,\u00a0 all cards their arrows point to are affected, regardless of who controls them.\u00a0 Carefully planning is needed, or your cards may end up destroying each other.</p>\n<p>In this Demo, players can play against an AI opponent using a premade deck. Any feedback to improve the game is highly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:13:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d64abe43bafaeaaf9ae495dc211c933c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Luis Huiza"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
