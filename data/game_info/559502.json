It is focused on Story and Gameplay experience to allow you the player to explore a world and get to know those who inhabit it. You'll find awesome loot and customize your character as you progress throughout the story and the choices you make will impact the outcome of your adventure. Not all those who embark on a journey can see it to its end, and not all who see it to the end find themselves where they'd like to be. As you take your first steps in this world you'll have to choose who you want to become and what you want to accomplish, and if you don't choose then the choices will be made for you and the consequences will follow your character; good or bad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2cfd8900777eec6b56f9e4fd05507c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shadowshade Development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
