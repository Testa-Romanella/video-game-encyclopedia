What, you expected to just mine?</p>\n<p>Made for Juice Jam, 2022</p>\n<p>Destroy enemy ships to gather progress points, install the chosen upgrade and choose the next one. New enemies appear in next waves and they sure aren't happy with value drifters.</p>\n<p>From now on, my new rule of thumb: don't develop a game that takes more than 2 days for a week-long game jam. Seriously, crunching ain't healthy, boys and girls. Still, the game leaves a lot to be desired, content-wise, juiciness-wise\u00a0and balancing-wise,\u00a0but still is a fun and somewhat juicy experience. I liked making a shader for asteroid rendering a lot, despite it being quite simple.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Alex \"<strong>Solawk</strong>\" Khanov \u2013 Game Design, Programming, Graphics<br/><strong>Nicknamed</strong> \u2013 Graphics<br/></p>\n<p>Some sounds are taken or originate\u00a0from Warframe and Battleships Forever</p>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>\"Boss Hunter\", \"Afterburners\", \"Killstealer\", \"Night Squad\", \"Stalker\", \"Boneyard\", \"Running From Demons\" by Waterflame<br/>Cynematic \u2013 \"Legacy\", Waeys &amp; Smetvrees \u2013 \"Icarus Fell\" by\u00a0Ninety9Lives<br/></p>\n<p>Late Night Radio by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/7613-late-night-radio\u00a0<br/>License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T09:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c23/c239c20bd60b3db534167241e20eb1bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Solawk"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
