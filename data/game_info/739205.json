Since I was little I always enjoyed RPG and it is now with little things I know that I could start this game as both a hobby and, if the future allows me to, a job.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I would like to warn you that even if this game is an uncategorized age game, I address this as a +16 game due the content of let\u2019s say\u2026 tough topics since this world much as ours has a vast sea of ideologies and unjust laws within our own point of view.</p>\r\nSynopsis\r\n<p>The world isn\u2019t what it seems. Layers of lies, deception and entities hidden from the public eye affect every life and day.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this precious, four normal people meet along the way for various tasks and quest until unbeknownst to them they get caught into a multiplanar war and a race against the clock to get various gem-like artifacts called \u201cThe Lament of Luck\u201d which bestow the power to the user of eliminating the plane opposite to their and thus those who are attuned to them.\r\n</p>\n<p>Now here lies the most important question\u2026 What would you do and what consequences would your action have? That\u2019s something even gods can not answer.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p><strong>On-Map Encounters: </strong>Encounter enemies through direct contact while moving in hostile areas.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Turn Based Combat: </strong>The encounter is divided by turns. At the beginning of each turn you choose what all your party members will do in a turn then each creature in combat takes it action depending how fast it is or if the their ability, which they use, has priority.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Choice-Focus System: </strong>At many times in the story, you will have chosen one of the options given thus affecting the future story you will be playing.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Resource &amp; Crafting System: </strong>You can create new items to upgrade your characters, these items need a set amount of various objects to be made, which to simplify in this description would be called resources. Resources can be found and extracted from around the map, be dropped by some creatures after you defeat them in encounters and be bought in some specific locations.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment System: </strong>Along your journey you will gain points in various factions depending on what you do, this will allow you to have exclusive items depending on the faction that favorites you more, change in the dialogues of many creatures or even have some exclusive secondary missions.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Training Ability System:</strong> You can get new abilities and spells from NPCs by special quests, shopping for them or having some exclusive interactions.</p>\r\nSocial Media", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T08:34:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b76/b765b34d45a37ea372f3090e47c74b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lament Projects"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
