You RUN and KILL...That's what you do!<br/>in the world of radiant cell, get ready to defend yourself as you wall run, shoot, slow down time, and of course grapple.<br/>Be prepared to quickly adapt to new enemies and new environments in every level.<br/>This is a fast-paced, parkour, shooter with inspiration from games like Ghost Runner, Titanfall and many more.<br/><br/>This is an easy game to pick up and play but hard to master. There are many routes to take to escape each level but not all of them will be the fastest.<br/>You will want to replay the levels multiple times until you find the best gun and the best route to kill the most enemies in the fastest time!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T11:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e48/e4895186bd986faebc6c9f716325e18e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 266, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Bite games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
