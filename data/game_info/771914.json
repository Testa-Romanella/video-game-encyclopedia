Your task is to create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two airports. Score points by landing airplanes, and make sure no two aircraft get too close together! <br/></p>\n<p>Visit the official website<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p><strong>Auto Traffic Control</strong> is played by writing code that interacts with the game. You need three things to play the game:</p>\r\n1. The Game\r\n<p>The easiest way to get the game is to download it via the itch app. We provide pre-compiled\u00a0binaries of\u00a0the game\u00a0for\u00a0Linux,\u00a0macOS,\u00a0and\u00a0Windows. And when a\u00a0new\u00a0version\u00a0is released,\u00a0you'll\u00a0get that automatically through\u00a0the\u00a0app\u00a0as\u00a0well.</p>\r\n2. A Client Library\r\n<p>The communication between the game and your program is done through an API. We publish client libraries that make it super easy to get started. Check the documentation to see which languages are officially supported. Missing yours? Open an issue on GitHub to let us know!</p>\r\n3.\u00a0 Your Program\r\n<p>And finally, you need to create a program.
