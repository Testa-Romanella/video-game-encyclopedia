I don't have a release date for the game yet since school is eating up most of my time right now.</p>\n<p>Controls: arrow keys</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get to the treasure in order to progress through the levels until you beat the game. But you have to do all of that in one sitting or else this happens. Currently, there are only 3 levels, but I'll add more soon!</p>\n\n<p>Big thanks to\u00a0GoldenProjects#5410 for helping with debugging! This is the first-ever game I've made with Godot and GDScript and he's already experienced with all of this so he really helped!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T03:53:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/5878a73371b038708cb6cd969a29e34a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Plextora"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
