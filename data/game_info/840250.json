You can play as Larry, an ordinary duck, that is now great.</p>\n<p>There is WASD movement as well as arrow key. You can smash pesky enemies with your double jump, as it sends an egg flying out of your bum.</p>\n\n<p>The music and art were made by me, the music is sadly recycled as that junk is hard to make. If I continue this project, better music is in order.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading/playing my game, it means a lot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T13:21:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["QuintupleA"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
