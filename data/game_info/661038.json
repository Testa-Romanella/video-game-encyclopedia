The project has since been abandoned, and has been sitting on my hard drive for the better part of a year, untouched. Guess it wouldn't hurt to release it, even if everything is unrefined, and bugs and unfinished content are rampant. Heck, it might not even run on integrated graphics.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>The goal was to create as much of the game on my own as possible, hence, around 95% of models, art, code, shaders, animations, music, sound and more have been custom made from scratch for this project. The only major exceptions to this are a few utility addons for Unity, ~50% of sound effects which are licensed under CC0 from freesound.org, a couple placeholder animations from mixamo, and the original title screen composition by Francis \"Salted\" Mailloux, the owner of Wynncraft.</p>\n\n<p>As a game, the project is somewhat unremarkable, having no objectives or fightable bosses despite being a boss rush, and only 4/5 classes implemented with a few missing spells. What has been made, though, is a moderately advanced movement system, rigid spell and dialogue/quest systems, saving, passably intelligent enemy AI, and most importantly 4 beautiful maps to explore and interact with. The cool stuff that I can put in my CV and never get a job with ;)<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>o--- CONTROLS ---o<br/></p>\n<p>-WASD: Move</p>\n<p>-Space: Jump / Double jump<br/></p>\n<p>-Mouse: Look around<br/></p>\n<p>-Shift: Combat roll / Air dash</p>\n<p>-Left click: Main attack</p>\n<p>-Right click: Initiate click combo for spells</p>\n<p>-E: Interact</p>\n<p>-Scroll wheel / 1-4: Change character</p>\n<p>-R: Drink a health potion</p><p>-Esc: Pause menu<br/></p>\n<p>-F3: Performance overlay<br/></p>\n<p>-F: Free camera, noclip<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Not legally associated with Wynncraft, despite the clear trademark and copyright infringements. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>By downloading the files, you agree not to:<br/></p>\n<p>-Redistribute any of the included content.</p>\n<p>-Publish footage of the included content online.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T20:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c825a922ce0d7034f1f885294c774e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 588, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aarontti"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
