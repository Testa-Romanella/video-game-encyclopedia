But above all, what your little angel \n      needs is your love and attention. All this, plus an enormous selection \n      of toys, clothes, and other objects will make your little one the \n      happiest baby in the whole wide world!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd59ae3de068c8bfba1d40ea438dc52.jpg", "website": "http://www.raylightgames.com/games/my-little-baby/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 272, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Raylight Games", "TREVA Entertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Family"], "publishers": ["TREVA Entertainment", "dtp young entertainment", "cdv Software Entertainment USA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
