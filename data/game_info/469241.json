I'm Aline Hui, the creator of Anchor.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It's my first complete game. I was in a bad state of depression. I kept feeling that\u00a0I was about to float away... I thought it would be nice to have an anchor to pin me down in\u00a0this chaos. So I made this game to make my own anchor(literally hahah). Surprisingly, the process of making Anchor is already like a therapy to me...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anyhooo.</p>\n\n<p>Anchor has one and only mechanism: Press SPACE to drop the anchor and stop the time. This means that if you ever see a scene you enjoy just drop the anchor and it will stop changing. Some random weather will not be affected though. Press SPACE again to lift the anchor and resume changing.</p>\n\n<p>1. DO NOT buy/play this game if you are looking for some adrenaline or so.<br/>2. CONSIDER buy/play this game if you want some peace.</p>\n\n<p>May you find your anchor.</p>\n\n<p>Aline Hui</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T03:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7f/e7fd20c060ddf1a5d9c3131c22416b39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixierr"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
