Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the Andromeda system (and well marked on all up-to-date Quadrant charts) is the Blaze Zone. This is a military defence area, designed to test some of the Federation's latest weaponry. It is off-limits to all but military personnel, and no unshielded craft should attempt to enter it. Upon entry, the defences are automatically activated and incineration in one of several ways can be\u00a0 expected within 3 minutes. Theoretically, it is possible to fly straight through the Blaze Zone and emerge into free space on the other side. This path, however, it not recommended, and todate has not been succesfully negotiated. The Military refuse to say how many pilots have been killed or seriously injured during routine exercises within the zone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>:\u00a0</strong>A<br/><strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Cursor LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Fire:\u00a0</strong>A</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game:</strong>\u00a0Z<br/>\n<strong>Move:</strong>\u00a0Arrow keys LEFT/RIGHT<br/><strong>Fire:</strong>\u00a0Z</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Blaze - Romik Software Ltd.\r\n</p>\n<p>Creator (WLS) homepage link:\u00a0https://www.wls.hu/blaze-gbc\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/484/484189ebea8a64b7b07072a70a480e64.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
