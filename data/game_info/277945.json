{"id": 277945, "slug": "jet-lancer", "name": "Jet Lancer", "name_original": "Jet Lancer", "description": "<p>Jet Lancer is a frenetic aerial dog-fighting game where you hunt enemy pilots, carve up giant robots, and defy death at supersonic speeds as a daring mercenary in the far future.<br />\nEquip your jet with a variety of armaments and upgrades as you hunt the deadliest prey the world has ever seen: giant killer robots.  Do you prefer the reliability of the missile swarm? The intimidation factor of the Megalaser? Or maybe you&#39;re comfortable showing off with nothing more than your mini-gun, your afterburners, and a single point of health.  The choice is yours\u2014 if you&#39;re daring enough to take it.<br />\nAce in the Hole: Make your way from a rookie mercenary to an Ace Pilot in a story-driven single player campaign.<br />\nExceed Limits:A state-of-the-art fighter jet is only as good as it&#39;s pilot. Can you unlock its potential and soar to new heights?<br />\nNo Ordinary Ordinance: Acquire new weapons and customize your jet&#39;s load out to fit your personal play style for any mission.<br />\nTiny but Mighty: Fight colossal robots far outside your weight class to save the world.<br />\nVladimir Fedyushkin is the designer of Jet Lancer. From a young age he was more interested in learning how games are made rather than playing them.  Starting the moment he learned to tweak a config file in GTA 3, he taught himself to script, code, texture, and design games.  A string of random events in his life led him to game development as a career and he hasn&#39;t looked back. You can follow him on Twitter @WhyNotArtDump<br />\nNicolai is the code wizard in charge of making things move on the screen. He hits buttons and helps to make the game as fun as we envisioned in our minds. You can follow him on Twitter @NicolaiGD<br />\nFat Bard are the guitar-shredders behind Jet Lancer&#39;s soundtrack. A composition/sound design duo, they create memorable music and immersive audio for games.<br />\nJet Lancer is the debut game from Vladimir Feduyskin and Nicolai Danielsen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-06T16:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27a/27a3ed6db3c03d376edd34fabe734052.jpg", "website": "http://www.jetlancergame.com", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 57, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 12, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 12, "platforms": ["macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Nicolai Danielsen", "Vladimir Fedyushkin"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Armor Games Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
