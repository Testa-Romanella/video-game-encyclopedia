{"id": 934589, "slug": "in-out-alive", "name": "In & Out Alive", "name_original": "In & Out Alive", "description": "You can play as a Lone Wolf (Solo / Singlplayer) or in a group (MultiPlayer).<br/>\r\nYour main goal is to obtain the lost Artefact within the chosen area.<br/>\r\nIn the area you've chosen are the enemies and they don't want you to obtain their artefact.<br/>\r\nSo you have to fight for your own life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemies:<br/>\r\n\t1. Beast -&gt; Tank type of Monster, with decent amount of health and with big claws,<br/>\r\n\t\t    which does a pretty solid damage. He is a close range monster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t2. Patient -&gt; Not a very smart entity. He likes walking around, but if he sees you,<br/>\r\n\t\t      then he will chase after you, gives average damage, few bullets can take him down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t3. Porter -&gt; Something like a mage, but not as smart, the only spell he knows how to summon a fireball,<br/>\r\n\t\t     that aims at you and he can teleport himself somewhere that is close to you.<br/>\r\n\t\t     He is really annoying and hard to hit. He can be taken down by few bullets. <br/>\r\n\t\t     But you must hit him first (It's hard to hit him).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t4. Keeper -&gt; Has good Health and gives even better Damage. his only goal is to keep his artefact all for himself.<br/>\r\n\t\t     And he will track you from the moment you will arrive, to the moment you will leave. But be aware! <br/>\r\n\t\t     If you pick up the artefact, he will get in \"rage mode\" (2x Health,2x Damage)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf this is too easy for you, you can make it harder in lobby by sellecting higher difficulty (adds more enemy damage,<br/>\r\nas well as ability to regenerate their health if their are not fighting)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOr you can give yourself less time to achieve your main goal (finding artefact)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can choose from 3 avatar options:<br/>\r\n\tA. Tiffany: Has Medium Hp and Damage. She's eqquiped with her favorite weapon the \"MP5\", with total of 150 deadly bullets,<br/>\r\n\t\t    as for her second best friend there is P320 With xx? bullets,and of course nobody can go on a mission without knife,<br/>\r\n\t\t    and in the darkest areas, you would like to see something, so you can use the flashlight attached to her shoulder.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tB. Scout: Big fan of M4A4 (with xx bullets prepared to be used) and a Colt 1911 (with xx bullets also prepared to be used),<br/>\r\n\t\t  he has a sharp knife, ready for this job and also has a flashlight.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tC. Igor :  No Face, no skin to be seen, just a suit. but he is cool (i hope so) carrying an Ak (xx Rounds) and with his favorite handgun Baretta(xx Rounds).<br/>\r\n\t\t   Also has a knife (I half expected it to be made out of wood) but he is sharp... at least he said he is. (Also owns Flashlight attached to his left Shoulder)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAreas: <br/>\r\n\t1. Area 1 -&gt; Secret Laboratory, with big Corridors, lots of doors and plenty of space.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n        2. Area 2 -&gt; Pyramid in Desert. You have to find a way into the middle of the pyramid, to face the Special Artefact keeper,<br/>\r\n\t\t     if you defeat him, you can pick up the artefact and leave.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMore maps will be added in updates.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T06:06:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/607/6073749900018f2f77e3e158caca5d63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kordsky"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Kordsky"], "esrb_rating": null}
