You notice a cave, and once you\u2019re inside, you're stuck until morning.\"</p>\n\n<em>Controls</em>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> to navigate through rooms.</p>\n<p><strong>Click and Hold</strong> to turn the Valve in the\u00a0<strong>Water Room</strong>.</p>\n<p>To enter the\u00a0<strong>Paper Room</strong>, click on the door in the\u00a0<strong>Water Room</strong>. To close it,\u00a0<strong>click and hold</strong> on the lever on the wall.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Click</strong> on the stack of paper to collect papers for a maximum of 5 at a time.</p>\n<p>To exit rooms,\u00a0<strong>click</strong> on the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<em>How to play</em>\n<p>There are 4 rooms in the game: The <strong>Fire Room</strong>, the <strong>Pipe Room</strong>, the <strong>Water Room</strong>, and the <strong>Paper Room</strong>. If the fire goes out or you stay in the room with\u00a0<em>it</em> for too long, you will die. Hit the pipe to scare\u00a0<em>it</em> away if you see it, and use the door in the Water Room to lock it out. Make sure to constantly give the fire paper from the paper room, and make sure to keep the valve in the water room tightly shut, or else water will leak into the fire room.</p>\n<p>Survive until morning to win.</p>\n<em>Important Notes:</em>\n<p>The audio in the web version might be a little weird. Luckily this doesn't happen in the downloadable\u00a0versions.</p>\n<p>I kinda had to rush this\u00a0to publish it, so if there are any bugs, let me know! I'm planning to release a post-jam version later on.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23649f51605dd338c1eb5a817469d8f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Pretzol"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
