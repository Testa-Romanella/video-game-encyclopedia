They may randomize or choose a specific time and place they wish to travel, facing personal challenges of their choice\u00a0along the way. The aim of the stops the group (or individual) takes is to return with thoughts, feelings, and perspectives that they did not arrive with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This aim is supported by the use of Vestiges, a mechanic in the game that requires players to support and appreciate each other's individual journeys while still weaving a singular story. In solo play, the flow of the game relies on rewarding oneself for their own self-discovery and overcoming their own struggles.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47b/47b0bf44bd1317231a88831b8fc281e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirHeckaLot"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
