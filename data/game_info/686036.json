They're first encounter is with the strongest, most ruthless\u00a0 AI to ever wake the cyber realm. <strong>Dues!</strong> Dues spares them though. But not without reason. This poor soul is destined, in the name of Dues, to fight off CyberDemons and bring cyberspace back to a safe realm.<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nVersion Updates\r\n<p>If you've followed the progression and journey of this game I want to say two things. Thank you so much. And I'm so sorry. MAN has it been a journey. Three different versions in the span of 4 years. This version is it though, I swear! The structure of the project has been reworked to scale properly and allow for so many new things!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>So what are these new things?</strong><br/><br/> <strong>First, there's a new boss</strong> (yes it has replaced the first boss. Will I add the original back in? maybe. I did like the mechanics and want to rework it in.) but there's a whole new list of enemies added! In fact I've completely reworked level progression (still to only level 15, we will get past this progression one of these days!)\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Second is a shop rework.</strong> The multiple shop idea has been scrapped and there's only one shop. When you go into it you'll see some new buttons, specifically range. This was something a lot of people wanted. But it took an entire rewrite of enemies and how they function. I can now say there is a proper parent\u00a0function for enemies!<br/><br/></p>\r\nFuture Updates\r\n<p>The next thing that needs done is more bosses. so. many. more. bosses.<br/><br/>After that? I want to develop the powers you gain. I want a better progression of power ramp and how you feel playing the game. So at some point you're going to get a laser.\u00a0<br/><br/>Please let me know what you think. I can't read minds (yet). I created this game because I wanted to play this kind of game. If my project can be that for other people then I want to facilitate that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T09:18:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2b7cb2ec63e28ab919d8fbb4e22c0f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BTL games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
