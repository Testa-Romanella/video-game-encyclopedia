{"id": 927466, "slug": "codex-martialis-stara-szkola", "name": "Codex Martialis: STARA SZKO\u0141A", "name_original": "Codex Martialis: STARA SZKO\u0141A", "description": "<p>S<strong>tara Szko\u0142a</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Have you ever had the experience  of enjoying an RPG session, finding yourself immersed in the drama, the  living elements of the setting, the personalities of the characters, and  then\u2026 a fight begins. You start combat and suddenly everything starts  to feel clunky. You no longer really have control over what your  character does, but instead have to follow a restrictive set of rules,  waiting your turn to perform one of a few predictable actions from a  limited set of options. Did you ever wonder where the story went when  the fighting started?\r\n</p>\n<p>Like the original Codex Martialis, Stara  Szko\u0142a is meant to bring that same sense of agency and immersion you  feel when your character is walking down a shadowy corridor into every  fight you engage in. Feel the danger, sense the thrill of calculated  risks, the dynamic tension of cunning tactics taken and thwarted, daring  gambits that succeed wildly or fail dismally. Stara Szko\u0142a allows you  to enjoy combat that has a flow and a natural rhythm, in which you can  make real tactical decisions which do affect what happens. It allows the  outcome of the fight to be determined not just by the number of \u2018Hit  Points\u2019 or magic used, but by combat tactics you think up yourself.\r\n</p>\n<p>Stara  Szko\u0142a is based on our original Codex Martialis rules, but designed to  be simpler, faster paced, and easier to jump right into. This rulebook  is only fifty pages, and it includes character generation, equipment and  a micro adventure. And yet, it has everything you need to make  characters, jump right into the action and start fighting. The combat  rules and Char Gen are five pages each.\r\n</p>\n<p>Stara Szko\u0142a is designed  and tested by Historical European Martial Arts practitioners and  historical researchers, who know something about the fencing manuals of  the middle ages and the world they came out of. If you want to walk the  streets of the fencing masters, and test your mettle against the  dangerous denizens of the medieval world, Stara Szko\u0142a is your ticket to  a place you never knew before, and may never want to leave.\r\n</p>\n<p>SSk includes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Complete combat rules.\r\n</li><li>Melee and Missile weapons with their traits and costs.\r\n</li><li>Shields and Armor with their traits and costs.\r\n</li><li>Miscellaneous equipment and currency.\r\n</li><li>Complete point based Character generation with 6 classes, and 26 Skills.\r\n</li><li>Sample adventure with maps, NPCs, and four pre-generated PCs.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>SSk  is very similar to Codex Martialis, just simpler, and is compatible  with the rest of the system with small adjustments. It does not include  magic but that will be forthcoming in another supplement (as a simpler  'SSk' version of Codex Superno). SSk does not include Martial Feats but  there will also be another small supplement with the SSk equivalent,  called Fighting Traits.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T14:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/390/390853695bd2c11394c9f8b1050ca418.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Codex Integrum"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
