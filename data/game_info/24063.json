But recently, Haggar is feeling uneasy \n      after learning that Mad Gear was not completely destroyed. Once again \n      the Mad Gear Gang has emerged and this time they want revenge. They'll \n      stop at nothing to bring Haggar and the entire world down to its knees. \n      This time they've kidnapped Guy's master, Genryusai and his daughter, \n      Rena.
