But when it's being offered by wizards, one cannot refuse such a lucrative opportunity.</p>\n<p>A reluctant but necessary party-up leads the trio in search for an unidentified magical object that crash-landed in the Barren Oasis. Will the three be able to work together to complete the quest or die trying?</p>\n<p>Influence the story with your strategy during the turn-based combat against various monsters. Lina the Rogue\u00a0can run in recklessly for the kill but this attracts all the monsters to her.\u00a0 Isaac the Knight is built to take hits, Elyon the Dracologist can hold back the damage, but coordinating their actions requires trust and patience.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>4000 words</li><li>Turn-based-combat gameplay</li><li>Two endings</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Justinn </strong>- <em>Project Lead/Programmer/GUI/Editor -\u00a0</em>In DevTalk+ Discord,\u00a0 itch</li><li><strong>Dave Attia</strong> - <em>Composer for Town and Desert track</em> -\u00a0twitter</li><li><strong>Lena Fisher</strong> - <em>Background Artist</em> -\u00a0twitter,\u00a0itch</li><li><strong>Maneki-Mushi</strong> - <em>Sprite Artist</em>\u00a0-\u00a0twitter,\u00a0itch</li><li><strong>Scylla Grand</strong> - <em>Writer</em> -\u00a0twitter</li><li><strong>Edgey\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0<em>Writer -\u00a0twitter</em><br/>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>Other tracks obtained from\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/sei_peridot\u00a0CC-BY</p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Download the zip file.
