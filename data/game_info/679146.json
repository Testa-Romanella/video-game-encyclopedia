Yet as a blind dog, she can't see through her eyes.\u00a0All she can use is\u00a0the sounds she hear through her ears, the ground she touches through her paws, and the scents she smell through her nose.<br/></p>\n<p>The most important thing is to follow the smell. Yet smells can be misleading, for they can be preserved for about three days, and you may be following the route she walked yesterday or the day before yesterday. And even worse, sometimes smells can be swiped off by the water of the streams in the countryside or be covered by the smelly gasoline of the vehicles in the busy city avenues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- How to Play -</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Mouse to Turn around</p>\n<p>\u00a0 W A S D to Move around</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Left Shift + W A S D to Sprint</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Spacebar to Jump</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hold Tab to show the Distance from the Nearest Smell of her</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0Hold Esc to show Tutorials<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Earphones are required, for the sound will help to provide the info of where you are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Different smells is presented as different colors of particles, and the amount matters.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 When it rains, dogs can only sniff the scents within several feet; while in sunny days, they can sniff as far as half a mile.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Experimental Prototype -\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is a very early experimental prototype.\u00a0The full game is supposed to have combat system with a boss-battle,\u00a0several branching narrative events with voice-acting, and two more levels of city and countryside besides this beginner level of\u00a0suburb,\u00a0and\u00a0etc. but these mechanics\u00a0and contents are not included\u00a0in this rapid prototype, for before the heavy dev work,\u00a0I wanna firstly experiment if the core mechanic is fun.\u00a0So please feel free to leave comments below and tell me how you feel about it. Do you think this core mechanic is interesting? or need to be improved (and what do you hope it has in future)? or simply boring and you don't wanna play it at all?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T06:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad49de622ef0789c6d3fcde8964c5b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Brie Y.
