I took upon myself to try and create a 1D game (or come as close to it as possible, taking into consideration that people can't see strictly 1D shapes).</p>\n<p>In this game, your goal is to protect the Monastery (grey) from the enemies (red) and destroy their Gate (light red) using Monks (green).</p>\n<p>Every fraction of a second, the Monks and enemies move. If an enemy steps on a Monk, the Monk dies. However, when you press\u00a0<strong>SPACE</strong>, the Monk that is further along on the map creates a water spell, which stays active for a short time and kills any enemies that step into it.\u00a0The spell then has a short cooldown.<br/></p>\n<p>The Monastery and the Gate periodically spawn Monks and enemies respectively.</p>\n<p>If 3 enemies reach the Monastery, you lose. If 3 Monks reach the Gate, you win.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the game's difficulty on the left side of the screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T08:23:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50f/50f06c5c1c86761e9cea8a16a3a8c1f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darezar of Eledris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
