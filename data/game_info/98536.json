The game has a first person perspective, where you play as a sorcerer who got into a fight with his neighbor who happens to be a necromancer. The goal of the game is to kill off the skeletons summoned by the necromancer so that his shield is weakened and you can damage him with your attacks.</p><p>Since the game was developed for the Alt Ctrl Game Jam, it has been designed for an alternative smart glove controller, but it's completely playable with any standard keyboard and mouse setup.</p><p>The game is played by mimicking the movements of the hand in the game, such as making a closed fist, a peace sign, a loser sign and just bending your thumb as shown in the video.</p><p>Credits go to team Odd One Out:</p><p>Petar Grchevski - Game design and development</p><p>Martin Vasilkovski - Controller design and development</p><p>Special thanks go Igor Panchevski, Darko Jovanov and Kristijan Trajkovski who assisted us in the development process.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67bfe0157d074713b86182d45513ace2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["astereortypicalNerd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
