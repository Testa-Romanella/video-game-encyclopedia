However every time you perform a control action, a new action is assigned for the key. Try to avoid crashing into randomly placed boulders.</p>\n<p>Controls include changing direction, steering the car 45 or 90 degrees and changing the gear.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to increase the gear and speed up the car in order to get more steering options. This creates a dynamic where you have to put yourself in fast and risky situations in order to persevere.</p>\n<p>Tested working on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. Should work on most common browsers that support HTML5 and WebGL2.</p>\n<p>The game dynamically changes the resolution based on the size of the browser content so it should support pretty much any display size. You can go into fullscreen by pressing the icon on the top left.</p>\n<p>The game was made with my own self written HTML5/Javascript/WebGL2 game framework in 48 hours\u00a0for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>All feedback is appreciated and\u00a0I truly hope you enjoy my game : )</p>\n<p>Programming, Design and Art by Jere Koivisto</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e6d326dcc050da0f91c02c72fdd35a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Romma"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
