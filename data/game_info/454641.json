They will fly right through the doughnut, unharmed.</p>\n<p>Controlls:<br/>W/A/S/D --- Moving<br/>SPACE ------- Shoot</p>\n<p>This game was developed as Part of the Mini jam 56. The Theme was Sky and you had to include 2 random themes (in this case Doughnut and war zone). So i created a Game where you fight against pastry with doughnuts as projectiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first game jam and even though I`m very sleep deprived It was a whole lot of fun and learning. I cant wait to see all the other great games you guys made.</p>\n<p>The next time i participate in a game jam(which will definitly happen), I will be a lot more prepeared.</p>\n<p>But now i have to get some rest.</p>\n\n<p>Programms used:</p>\n<p>Bosca Ceoil</p>\n<p>BFXR</p>\n<p>Aseprite</p>\n<p>Gimp</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T02:32:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a75c8ca0f6d7d8b3c870bda14065cdb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cubzer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
