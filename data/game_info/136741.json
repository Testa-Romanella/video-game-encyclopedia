The theme of 2013's jam was to base a game idea off of a select quote from famed game designer and wishful thinker, Peter Molyneux. This particular jam was my first successful attempt to create a competently functional game in such a short time period. The game itself is a simple puzzle game, wherein the player must uncover the randomly selected People piece by clicking away all the others.</p>\r\n\t\t\u201cIf you could imagine, there was this hill completely full of people, like a forest of people.
