This is my first time working in Unity, and so I wanted a design concept that was simple enough to execute on while still being fun to play.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on the theme, I\u00a0remembered the wide genre of browser games from my childhood that relied on moving the mouse through a maze without crashing. That seemed a lot simpler than attempting a platformer for my first game, so I\u00a0went for it! And unlike the old browser games, Mouse Maze does NOT include any jump scares!</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Simply move the mouse around the screen to navigate menus, play the levels, and change settings! Hover over buttons to click them; touch toggle buttons to flip them; and zip around the levels all with a flick of the wrist!</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>9 levels packed with twists, turns, and moving platforms!</li><li>Settings to adjust the difficulty:<ul><li>Turn on / off level timers</li><li>Turn on / off \"Forgiveness Mode\" *</li></ul></li><li>A crash counter and run timer so you can compare scores with your friends!</li><li>A bumpin' soundtrack from\u00a0bensound.com!</li></ul>\n<p><em>*\u00a0Forgiveness Mode is a setting that will widen the hitboxes of the safe paths by a small amount so that the level doesn't register a crash as soon as you touch the yellow danger zones. Helpful if you aren't accustomed to manipulating a mouse with precision!</em></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Huge shoutout to all of these wonderful people and sources that contributed to making this game:</p>\n<ul><li>Playtesters:<ul><li>Oskar Grosser</li><li>DJF</li></ul></li><li>Game Jam hosted by:<ul><li>Solar Pellets</li></ul></li><li>Music: bensound.com</li><li>Font:\u00a0\"Yoster Island\" by codeman38</li><li>Many of my friends and family who encouraged and supported me throughout development!</li><li>My lovely wife who listened patiently to me ramble about various game development tasks and celebrated with me when some small piece of code began working \u2764\ufe0f</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:39:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee968c875a4ea63c06f7d666a779bee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fletchmakesstuff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
