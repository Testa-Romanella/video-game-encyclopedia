It was made in the Blender Game Engine. It doesn't seem exactly polished or smooth. It isn't an amazing looking game, but it's playable. That's essentially all I was going for on my first run. It might not be a great game, but keep in mind that it's my first published game.</p><p>Next off, please do follow the instructions on the file. it should be the second one down in the main folder. If you don't follow them, you might not have the same experience in the game. I wrote them as if it weren't talking to complete idiots, because I believe most of you will be able to figure it out. It's pretty simple.</p><p>Third, this might not be the final version of the game. I may revisit this in the future and if I do, what you play here will be a prologue, not even close to the full game. It might not even be the whole prologue.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you guys can appreciate this game for what it is, have fun and enjoy.</p><p>Also, yes I know there are problems with collision. I should've set the gravity to 0 and added collision to my objects. I'll know for next time</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RandomGameDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
