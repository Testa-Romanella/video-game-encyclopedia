You play as a little slime thingy that jumps around and you need to collect coins. Beware of the many spikes scattered around the levels as well as the bad slime thingies that are trying to eat you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to get all 30 coins for a special reward and don't forget to leave your opinions and suggestions in the comments. Also, check out my blog where I am and will be posting my other projects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>P.S. This game was originally made for a little project that I was participating in, but the project got cancelled so I decided to upload the game here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0c/c0cef432273d080fd060ee7c197400d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QsarQuest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
