You play as a small girl with her stuffed animal companion in house that is for what ever reason being extra scary tonight. I ran out of time so this is just a demo of mechanics that would be in the game . Escape the room and you beat the game ^^.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99bc0bf33311a979bb3a100f0e4aa779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["XaiasSerenity"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
