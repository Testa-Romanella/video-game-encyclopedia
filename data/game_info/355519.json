The sun is your death timer. Hurtle towards the sunset at breakneck speed in a futile race against time. Delay the inevitable by catching speed boosts which reverse the setting sun - if only for a moment. Race The Sun: Daily Challenge Edition is inspired by arcade games of the past with a focus on high scores, short game sessions, and pure fun mingled with nerve-wracking tension. The rules are simple: don't crash, stay in the light, and don't slow down!<br/><br/>This new edition of the game includes several new features including new alternate ships, colorful new trails, and a new \"daily challenge\" system that will test the skills of even the most experienced players.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T13:05:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b9/6b9046c7c6fdb28a8381d7bef22985e9_GqM9GaF.jpg", "website": "http://www.flippfly.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["FlippFly"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Flippfly"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
