And that's a great news because the US president ordered him to get back to service and fight the current terrorist attack. His toolset allows him to jump with a C4 bomb attached to his wheelchair, to shoot and move faster with his rifle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He's the only one who can stop them.</p>\n<p>My special thanks to JMO Assets, Cool Works Studio, Polygon Blacksmith, 255 Pixels Studios, Myxerman, Jarst and many more for the assets you created and sold for free on the asset store.</p>\n<p>Edit : If you're having trouble for moving with WASD, use a French keyboard and use ZQSD. I don't know how to manage the keyboard conversion easily so if you have any tips to solve this issue, don't hesitate to send me an inbox. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/670d3c7fd48cbde0068cdd9afd1ed7c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GrommelGod"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
