Most users will experience smoother gameplay and a slight FPS increase. This product boots Windows into a basic mode with fewer programs and services using whitelisting of processes which you cannot replicate by changing settings or killing processes. <br/><br/>Tired of lag during complex battle scenarios? Gaming Accelerator dedicates as much power as possible to your game that would otherwise be allocated to the many background programs and services that other applications leave running.
