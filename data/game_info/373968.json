Your goal as a player is not just to complete quests but to understand them. The main mechanic is to talk with the npcs and to search the environment to decode their cryptic language.</p>\n<p>BABEL BE HOME was created during the \u201cAdventure Course\u201d in the Game Design Bachelor's Program at the Zurich University of the Arts. Its main theme is the language barrier and the frustration it brings to people. The difficulty of communication which is not seen in modern games. The language is a context sensitive symbol code. The symbols are direct images of objects and concepts in the level so the player can guess them.</p>\n<p>In the current status this is a game prototype. We are collecting feedback based upon player experiences and feedback from the community. We are hoping to expand upon this prototype and refine its systems and to add more content.</p>\n<p>The current content in this prototype amounts to roughly 30-60 minutes of gameplay<br/><strong>Developers</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Pascal Felber</li><li>Sebastian Riedi</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:19:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/52749688ebb3f038239bb1e31d80656a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["sriedi", "Pascal Felber"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
