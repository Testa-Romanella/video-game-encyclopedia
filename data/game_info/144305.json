Guide it through a set of challenge gates to see what lies beyond the endless dark, while activating the p-Types and sending them on their way to the outside world. </p><p>e-Type moves automatically around the track, rotating as is his wont. Use the space bar and time your shots properly, and hit the p-Types with the matching color. Activate all the p-Types to advance to the next level, and clear all 20 to see the ending! You'll be graded by the number of shots you took to clear the game, so try to keep those to a minimum.</p><p>Originally created for Global Game Jam 2017.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c582023e1bd74d6c61c4be1036bef7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["inventroom"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
