Mario (yes that really is his name, but he is unfortunately neither Italian or a Plumber) and myself made this game after not using Unity in several years, and not being very good at it before then either. It's ugly, it's not that much fun, but it might possibly have some charm somewhere? Probably\u00a0not.</p>\n<p>But in all honesty, we both had a good time making this for the Brackey's Game Jam, even though we started late and finished in a buggy mess where we had to revert to an older less broken stage with less content (notably a lot of audio vanished, and bug fixes had to go, so more bugs/features for you to enjoy). So maybe you will enjoy it. If you do, please seek urgent help, and I can only apologise for how terrible this really is. (Just for clarity, the UI as bad as it is, is definitely intentional)<br/></p>\n<p>We did also only end up with 1 really fairly short level, so it's more of a demo than a full game. Well, so short it's more of a demo of a demo level I guess? <br/></p>\n<p>If you do take the time to play this game(?) though, I do genuinely appreciate it and want to thank you. It got us both back interested in game development and hopefully we will be back for another jam down the line but with something that feels more like a game.</p>\n<p>Thanks again - Will!<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:43:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/384690a456156fa832af1ce815239a87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hjorvard"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
