As the ball moves faster with every stage, the background visuals become more psychedelic and strange, along with obstructions, strobe lights and decoy balls to throw you off. You are also able to pick up different power-ups to assist you.<br/><br/><strong>Spin Tennis</strong><br/>Spin Tennis places you and a CPU opponent in a fast-pased, radial tennis match! You must protect your core from the ball, while also trying to wound your opponent's.<br/><br/><strong>HELL Mode</strong><br/>One life, no power-ups, longer lasting events and higher speeds make for Pongspin's ultimate challenge!
