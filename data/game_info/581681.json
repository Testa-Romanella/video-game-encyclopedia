All aspects of this project are not finalized and are subject to change.*</p><p>In a small town within an inch of death, a small creature dawning a mask of past plagues walks into the square and sets up shop. They are known as\u00a0the potion seller, a silent but well meaning individual, stocked with potions they created from what they could gather from the area. No one is exactly sure who they are or why they've decided to sell here, but the importance of their business is not lost on those hanging on in this small town.</p>\n<p>In <em>Just a Drop</em>, you play as the small-statured potion seller, an experienced shopkeep and adventurer who must utilize ingredients from local fauna &amp; plant life to create potions, that you may then sell to the townspeople or utilize out while adventuring to assist in combat or open up secret passageways in the dense forest bordering the town. You'll also meet a range of personalities, with their own stories and backgrounds (as well as shopping habits), showing the many different people just trying to make it to tomorrow in this unforgiving situation.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Designer &amp; Programmer -\u00a0</strong>Devon Hawley</p>\n<p><strong>Environment Artist &amp; Level Designer -\u00a0</strong>Brittany Whelihan<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Character Artist &amp; Animator -\u00a0</strong>Makayla Hicks<br/></p>\n<p><strong>UI Designer &amp; Programmer -\u00a0</strong>Zachary Simon<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Producer, Composer &amp; Narrative Designer -\u00a0</strong>Emily Cummings<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T15:24:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/736/7365d53b0ccf6d8d2aeca57ee8ab1d17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevTheGameDev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
