Avoid being in the sun to longer to die. Avoid the Star God's minions to keep from dying. Explore a uniquely created map with opportunities to catch some shade.</p>\n<p>Story (Largely unimplemented):<br/></p>\n<p>You are the last human on Kelt-9 a normally vibrant human settlement planet. I huge cataclysmic event swapped stars with another system causing space time to warp an ancient creature awakened to destroy human kind. You must survive on a hostile planet while during the day the star god sends heat rays down to kill you. During the night you must survive through constant minions and call rescue to come save you.</p>\n<p>This is an early prototype created for the WGJ-225. There isn't a whole lot of gameplay but the idea is there and the mechanic could be really neat if fleshed out.</p>\n<p>I was super ambitious with the map, (as per the usual)\u00a0so feel free to explore, but there is really not that much to do.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>Mouse - point to shoot</p>\n<p>Shift - Run</p>\n<p>The HUD is currently pretty simple, but there is a health bar (red), heat indicator (yellow), and stamina (green). Avoid having your health and heat indicators deplete, this will kill you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T08:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a157601eb8f3130a13b4ffa241b5302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nocturnal Wisp"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
