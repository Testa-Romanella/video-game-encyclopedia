One of the balls is controlled using the arrow keys while the other using WASD. In each\u00a0level the balls are moving\u00a0faster than in\u00a0the one before that and every level the number of walls increase and so does the number of red balls. If you hit a red ball, you lose. If you hit a blue ball you earn 1 or 2 points.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T12:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/00245a6f790a08cbcc1b15f347908112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bloody Wall Software"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
