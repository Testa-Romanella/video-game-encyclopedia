Whoops, did I say cow? I meant to say COW. That stands for \"Carry On Walking\".</p>\n<p>I suppose all of our COWs happen to be cows too. What a coincidence!</p>\n<p>Our COWs are bound together to solve puzzles. Some of our COWs are advanced enough that we call them COmputational Workers (COW for short). It's a logical LEAP, but you're BOUND to get it.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys: Move</li><li>Mouse: Click on things.</li><li>Spacebar: Pretty much everything else</li></ul>\n<p>This game is VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT There may be bugs or incomplete sections to this game, including audio.
