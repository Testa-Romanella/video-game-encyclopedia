The river can only flow left, right, or down. If you reach the sides, the canyon walls will turn the river back down.</p>\n<p>Your river will flow as long as you have power (indicated in the lower right).\u00a0Flowing near a tree or camp will provide it water giving you power. If a horse walks up to the river, it has a chance to take a drink also give you power. Hitting any object will flood it and reduce your power.</p>\n<p>The river flows faster after each pathway you cross. When crossing a path, going under the bridge will provide power, but hitting the path will reduce it.\u00a0The game ends when you run out of power.</p>\n\n<p>Game was created for Miz Jam 1 in under 48 hours.
