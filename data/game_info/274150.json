The game was made during the 43th Ludum Dare in only 48 hours. You play as a little fluffy ball of fur also called a \u201cSquish\u201d and you must reach the end of the level to save the princess Squish. To do so, you can sacrifice a fistful of poor creatures to progress through the traps placed throughout the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/321ee6ab242610ae9c0167d453121dc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OcunInde"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
