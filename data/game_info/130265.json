You will fight monsters along the way, and meet allies too. Speak softly and carry a sharp wooden branch with which to hit bad guys, and you'll make it through okay.</p>\n<p>This game is entirely keyboard-controlled. You can rebind the keys from the options menu. The defaults are A and S to attack, E to use items, and Enter to pause. <br/>You can save your game in the bed after the first area.<br/>You can also choose which items to purchase or ignore, and which areas to explore first, and there are a few secrets that might help you too.</p>\n<p>The music is from Incompetech.com!</p>\n<p>I have been working on this game on-and-off for a year and a half through depression. It's not what I hoped it would be, but I'm glad that I can finally release it. Thank you to my friends who believed in me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/233/233b48c07e6426ce3124eb3bccab2c44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fidgety"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
