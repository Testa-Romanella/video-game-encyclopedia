This is my 3D platformer game that I created for Michigan State University's\u00a0CAS 117: Games and Interactivity course. The game was created using assets from MSU, with the music produced on garage band by me\u00a0and the levels designed by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The three modifications that I created for the game are as follows:</p>\n<p>1) For my first modification, I\u00a0created 3 unique, new, levels which show a progression through the world of the game and increase in complexity as the game moves on.</p><p>2) For my second modification,\u00a0I made\u00a0a custom score (music) for the game\u00a0that fits the setting of space and gives an electronic / arcade feel to the game. I made this on garage band.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) For my third modification, I\u00a0redesigned\u00a0and updated the main\u00a0menu UI for the game. The main character can now jump around in a cave environment while you decide which button on the main menu to hit. I also adjusted the size of the main menu so that you can see a little more of the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, and I hope you enjoyed! Thank you for a great semester.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:56:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e7d190e4f9c0baa92f840eee3f5095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gcbg"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
