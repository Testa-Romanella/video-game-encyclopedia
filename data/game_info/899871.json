Join her on a quest to not be bored, or something along those lines?? Made for Gumdrop's birthday, 2022!!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Content warning: depictions of self-hate and discussions of suicide.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>There are references of/spoilers for the Candy RPG demo in this game, but it should also still be perfectly understandable without having played through that. There are references of/spoilers for the Lonely Wolf Treat games, as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, this game does not have music. It does have some ambience and some sound effects, however. I would recommend putting something soft and peaceful to play it to, such as this very non-specific track.</p>\n\n<p>It takes around 30-90 minutes to get to the end. Hopefully you enjoy it, if you decide to give it a play through!!</p>\n<p>Story &amp; Art by Blackberry Mochi, Characters &amp; Setting belong to NomnomNami <br/></p>\n<p>Additional Characters belong to npckc and Team Shanghai Alice<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T17:01:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65ad8dfd0674a9ba770fa2762e8ae3b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blackberry Mochi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
