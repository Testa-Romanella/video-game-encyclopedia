Good luck getting smooched! There's only the one tiny level.<strong>KNOWN ISSUES:<br/></strong>Launching an acorn is done randomly to the right or left, but sometimes it will use an old position where your paddle / stick was a couple of seconds ago. Insofar, I've been unable to solve this. Will adjust this annoying bug ASAP.<br/>There's also missing key art and textures, this is simply because I ran out of time! Please fill in the base greys and sketchy doodles with your wonderful sense of imagination.<br/>If you catch anything else, please let me know in the jam comments!<br/></p>\n<p>Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows or A and D keys to move your helpful bouncing-stick. Use the DOWN ARROW to throw an acorn into the hole. Unearth the treasures in the dirt and celebrate your serious crush on the queen of Trolls by gifting her what all trolls love most \u2014 GOLD!</p>\n\n<p><em>Thank you for playing </em><em>\u2665</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T03:50:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10ea6f5985fe975fdcc28a8635baaed6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chiligoat"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
