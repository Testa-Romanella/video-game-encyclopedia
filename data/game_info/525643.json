But what if such a thing were to really come true?<br/><br/>Alice Hanekawa and her 6 friends have been trapped, repeating their summer vacation for over 10 years. At first, it was fun... But fun gave way to boredom, boredom gave way to frustration, and it's only a matter of time before frustration gives way to madness. All of them are tired and worn down, and they barely talk to one another anymore... Everyone has splintered into little groups, and the unity they once had has completely eroded away. Even death is no escape.<br/><br/>Nothing has changed... But something has to. Of course, they've tried to find a way out before; tried to figure out the truth behind the time loop.  It's hardly her first attempt, but Alice has to do something... She's more desperate now than ever before. But will that really be enough? Even if she finds a way out, can she heal everybody's hearts before they leave? And what deeper mysteries could these time loops truly be holding?<br/><br/>Black Lilies - Eternal Summer is a one-man effort. After years of troubled development, lack of funding, and some snafus with artists, the developer was forced to make almost everything in the game himself, with no prior drawing experience.
