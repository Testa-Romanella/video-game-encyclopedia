Will U manage to escape from the police in this traffic?<br/><br/>Road Rush is a typical action game where you race with the police and fire away all the ammunition that you have. Collect money and shoot from an Uzi,  Gatling machine gun or a bazooka. The city is crowded and you must treat it as a crash arena. Destroy the cars which get in your way, race with the police and shoot at everything what moves.<br/>The game is very difficult and requires skill.
