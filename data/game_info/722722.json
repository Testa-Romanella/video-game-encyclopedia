(NotEuclid)", "description": "<p>One day, you\u2019re sitting at your desk when a mosquito flies in through your window and sits on your windowsill. Annoyed by its presence, you attempt to slap the mosquito, but only then do you realize your fatal mistake: this mosquito isn\u2019t messing around.</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0A and D to move, and Space to jump.</p>\n<p>This was made under 3 hours for Trijam #152, and the theme was \"Leave me alone!\"\u00a0I think my interpretation is pretty obvious and relatable. Aim for a high score by collecting as many coins as possible before the mosquito bites you!</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me within the 3 hours except for the game over sound (for which I combined two sound effects from pixabay), the ambience also from pixabay, the player sprite and animations\u00a0(which I reused from an earlier game of mine), and the jump and coin collection sounds (which I made for general purpose with bfxr). I would also like to credit GDG^meplayer for the name suggestion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:31:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43e/43e92abe18d470483409e054b3dd791f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NotEuclid"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
