Grab objects, move them, pile them... Anything you can think of!<br/><br/>The beautiful design is intended to create the illusion of being a simple two-dimensional illustration, while allowing you to enjoy a real three-dimensional realm that you wouldn't expect.<br/><br/>Have fun!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T03:48:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/5308efd5f9106d86aa1a680a786fbbcf_vzdeFbA.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["nada studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["nada studio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
