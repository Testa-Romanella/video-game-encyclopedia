You can drag-select your units with left mouse, order them to move with right mouse, and order an attack-move by first pressing \u201cA\u201d then issuing a move command. Units move and attack correctly, and will die. Technically, the objective is to keep your king unit alive, but again, there is no real game loop here.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:45:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff85ecabff33b9e2019823a7b38e5f12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["synsugarstudio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
