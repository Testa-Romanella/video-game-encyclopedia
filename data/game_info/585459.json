Your objective is to slam Poopkas by jumping on their heads and survive as long as you can!</strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Before you start suffering playing, I'll give some advice:</strong></em></p>\n<p>*Poopkas don't like when you get near the place where they come from.</p>\n<p>*The platforms are cursed. Reeealy cursed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*By the color of the campfire you can understand that you'll die soon.</p>\n<p>*There IS a secret level, try to find it ;)</p>\n<p><em>The game is really simple, because I made it just for fun for my friends, and set a goal to make this game as fast as possible. Came out within 4 hours, not bad. Also note that because the game is made in pixel artstyle, it has a very small resolution.
