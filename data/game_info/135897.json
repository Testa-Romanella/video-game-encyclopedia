During the race against this relentless opponent, the player must avoid other dangerous enemies, traps, and deal with various challenges along the way. The player is aided by his companion, a drone that can shoot projectiles at enemies. The projectiles cause the enemies to enter a ghost-like state, rendering them unable to see or harm the player, temporarily allowing the player to pass through them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/5873a421a589edb687230fdc62a9f9c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["tigerija"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
