You are Jack Times, and the zombie apocalypse\u00a0has happened. Your food supplies are empty and you need to restock - by finding 10 portions of food!\r\n</p><p>The game is played across one map. It is one hit kill so if you die, you restart. To access new sections of the map you must find keys to unlock the gates. You must also keep finding bullets \u00a0- ammo is precious.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There are two bosses to kill, one halfway and one at the end. For those who like the game and complete it, the run is timed; so you can try and beat your time / post your best time to gloat to others/me!</p>\n<p>A\u00a0good timed run is 8-10 minutes, but in theory it'll take you a few goes to complete so I estimate an average player will take 30-60 mins before completing.</p><p>This game was 100% completely made during the LowRezJam 2017 time frame, in my spare time. For those who don't know, the LowRezJam is limited to a 64x64 pixels view.\r\n</p><p>The graphics were done by me and this is the first time I have ever done pixel art, so I'm sorry if my attempts make you cry!\u00a0I think for a first attempt it's not that bad though ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Sound effects are from\u00a0soundbible.com\u00a0licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 3.0., except the key collect sound which is from\u00a0noiseforfun.com.

I have only done a Windows version for now, but if people ask I will do a Mac one. I just don't want to spend the time doing a Mac version if no-one ends up playing it! :) If anyone wants to test a Linux version I'll send it to them; let me know if it works, and if it does I'll make it available.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to see what else I get up to, please check out my website and collection of games at michael-bateman.com or follow me on Twitter @IndieDevBateman.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ec/9ec73c33a8740334d16ebc4517a91bf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Bateman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
