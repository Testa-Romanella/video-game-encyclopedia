Like her game, mine aspires to provide intuitive game mechanics with\u00a0 increasing complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys: move left &amp;\u00a0right</li><li>Return: start/stop game</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Pro tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Keep an eye out for the hints at the bottom of each level</li><li>You can return to a level you've previously played by clicking the \"lv1,\" \"lv2,\" etc buttons on the home page</li><li>The last level continues until you lose!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Playing with Philips Hue</strong></p>\n<p>In order to play with physical lights, you'll need a Hue bridge and five Philips Hue color LED bulbs. Traffic on your local network may interfere with gameplay, so try limiting the number of\u00a0\u00a0devices using your network for best results. Restarting the game may be necessary after a connection failure (or if lights are getting \"stuck\").</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you're playing this game at The Recurse Center, you can use the default settings and skip these steps.</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Find your bridge's IP address using this tool.</li><li>Visit\u00a0\u00a0http://&lt;bridge ip address&gt;/debug/clip.html</li><li>Follow the directions here to generate a user ID</li><li>Select \"Hue\" under \"Play mode\"</li><li>Enter the\u00a0IP address and user ID from above</li><li>Click \"Calibrate\" to test your settings and pair your bulbs with the game</li></ol>\n\n<p><em>Please feel free to comment with any feedback you have on the gameplay!
