Compete against a friend in this action-packed stick thrusting simulator! Coincidentally, dikdiks are a totally real animal. Crazy, right?</p>Controls:<ul>\n<li>Dikdik uses a single keyboard shared between two friends. Get close!</li> <li>Player 1 uses the \"A\" key (or anywhere on the left side of the screen on touch devices) to thrust her stick!</li> <li>Player 2 uses the \"L\" key (or anywhere on the right side of the screen on touch devices) to thrust her stick!</li></ul>How to Play:<ul>\n<li>Hold both keys (or screen areas) to start!</li> <li>Tap your key (or side of the screen) to thrust your stick forward. First player to push a block all the way out of the wall and knock out the opponent's dikdik wins!</li> <li>Some people seem to be able to hold out forever, so a time limit might be a good idea. Click the hourglass on the title screen if you want longer or shorter matches!</li></ul>Random Facts About Dikdiks:<ul>\n<li>Dikdiks have mild psychic powers that allow them to influence other animals, though most animals (other than dikdiks) are too smart to be swayed.</li> <li>Dikdiks are extremely anti-social, however they do seem to attract social butterflies when they put their nose where it doesn't belong.</li> <li>The collective noun for a group of dikdiks is a \"duet\".</li> <li>Once a dikdik gets a song stuck in its head, it will spread to other dikdiks like wildfire through that psychic influence network thing that I was telling you about earlier.</li> <li>It's said that dikdiks rarely graze at the same time. Seeing two dikdiks graze in unison is a sign of good luck (for the predator that is waiting for them both to be distracted).</li> <li>The dikdik's favorite song is \"Africa\" by Toto and they will thrash ferociously if it gets stuck in their head.</li></ul>Credits:<p>Programming by Eric Neuhaus (@donkeyspaceman)<br/>Art by Colin Greenhalgh (@CuddlyColin)<br/>Music by Derek Klaren (Soundcloud)</p><p>Created with Scirra Construct 2<br/>Sound effects made with Bfxr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03e/03eb0b0bb566a581054f0389c60cc97f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Virtually Competent"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
