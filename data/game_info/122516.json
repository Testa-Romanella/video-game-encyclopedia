Each student was tasked of creating a small game with three different puzzles. <br/><br/>As a big Ancient civilization/jungle lover, I went ahead with \"The Cube\", in which you are an explorer adventuring deep into the jungle in order to discover the secrets of a mysterious giant rotating construct. From a maze in the darkness to an ancient courtyard, you will explore three different levels to gain access to The Cube's entrance.</p><p>All the visuals and the coding were made by me. It's a very basic game that I made with tons of time constraints and limitations, but I'm proud of the results!</p><p>If you have any question, don't hesitate!<br/><br/>------- AKNOWLEDGEMENT -------</p><p>I own NO RIGHTS on the musics used in my game. They belong to Arenanet's Guild Wars 2 and Brandon Fiechter, an independant musician.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/458246454fe588f6ccd0518876a2c527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chabb"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
