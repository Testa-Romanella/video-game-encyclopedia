It takes place on a deserted island, where you find yourself washed up after a vicious kraken attack. Explore different areas of the island to find pieces of your ship so that you can finally escape. Be careful, though, as it may be easy to descend into madness, alone on an island. Fix your ship quickly, or risk suffering in eternal insanity.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/634/634fc1cef120ac203f340fa7f51370b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["whitegrapetuna", "alexcovert", "ogalfaro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
