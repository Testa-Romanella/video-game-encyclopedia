Very happy with how it turned out and learned quite a bit from it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are simple, A/D to move left and right respectively, Space is to jump. Collect the gold cubes as you ascend to further increase your score which will be revealed at the end. I wonder who will get the highest?</p>\n<p>While it does have (Not So) in it's name, that's more of a joke than anything as it sounded really funny.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:12:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49b/49b29a54cc8165f68e8b07f9d969bf33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Art of Tygrex"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
