Teaching robotics, programming, and sustainability is an often difficult, stressful, and even Kafka-esque endeavor -- being in one of the richest, most beautiful places on Earth, yet dealing with families with working parents, who are living out of a van, or sleeping on the street. It is hard trying to keep the kids out of gangs, off of drugs, and on a path towards better opportunities, such as the ones I had growing up in a slum area of paradise while going to an upscale private school. I made Neofeud to be a fun and engaging game in and of itself, but I also wanted the player to think about the society in which we live, as well as the one which we may be heading toward if nothing is done.</p>\n<p> <strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>\n<p> 2033 - We create AI. Sentient robots arrive, but not as our Terminator overlords or our Singularity saviors -- conscious machines are humanity's unwanted bastard children. A few are geniuses who design flying cars, beat cancer, invent teleportation, but millions of defective prototypes roll out of factories -- mentally challenged, motivationally-challenged, criminally-inclined. Legally conscious, but unhirable, these \"Defectives\" are shuffled through public housing and welfare assistance, straining the already overburdened back of the meager social safety net. The robots who don't end up in prison are dumped, as a last resort, into a massive landfill known as \"The Pile\".</p>\n<p> Humans engage in perfection of their species -- or at least the powerful and well-connected -- genetically engineering children with human and animal DNA. The failed eugenics experiment \"Frankenpeople\" are discarded into \"The Pile\" as well. The new dynasties, the \"Neofeudal Lords\", live in towering neon glass castles, shuttle around in pristine nanotech-enabled pods, minds and bodies full of cyberware, spending most of their time taking selfies and \"optimizing their monetization schemes\". A race of supermen concerned only with their own status, their prestige, their success. Where machines have become all too flawed and human, people have become flawless, perfect, cold machines.</p>\n<p> Karl Carbon is an ex-cop, dishonorably discharged from Coastlandia PD for disobeying an order to shoot an unarmed sentient humanoid. Karl is exiled to \"The Pile\" as a lowly social worker. There he counsels gangbanging foster-kid robots and confiscates chimera-children from deadbeat half-wolf parents. Till one day a case goes horribly sideways and Karl is drawn into a sordid conspiracy that could threaten the strained fabric of Human-Robot-Hybrid civilization -- or save it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>FEATURES </strong><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15+ hours of gameplay.\u00a0</li><li>An original dystopic sci-fi world and story that will (hopefully) be compelling and stimulate thought about our present society and future.\u00a0</li><li>Over 76,000 words of voice acted dialog.</li><li>Engaging but fair point-n-click detective work, interspersed with tense action sequences.</li><li>Handpainted, uber-gritty, noir futureland.

The game crashes during the fight with \"The Artist\".\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis is a known issue that I am working on a fix for in the next version. For now, try setting your sound, voice, and music volumes to the default level (about 80%) and it should be fixed.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t2. I'm having trouble downloading the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you're trying to download Neofeud through the Itch App, it may not work. Try downloading through the website instead. If you have difficulty downloading Neofeud through\u00a0Firefox, try an alternate browser such as Google Chrome.\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\n<p>3. I'm stuck in the game, is there a walkthrough?<br/></p>\n<p>Check out the Neofeud - 'Let's Play' Walkthrough series.</p>\n<p><strong>More About Silver Spook Games</strong></p>\n<p>Silver Spook Games is a one-person-team consisting of Christian Miller, a Hawaiian writer, artist, and game developer with a passion for creating works of depth and relevance. Growing up Native Hawaiian in Honolulu, Hawaii, he experienced a somewhat 'postmodern' and dissonant existence of clashing cultures, peoples, and extreme inequality. Inspired by games like Fallout, System Shock, Deus Ex and films like Aliens, The Matrix, Bladerunner, District 9, and Elysium, he has gone on to write stories and create games in the tradition of dark, cautionary, and (hopefully) groundbreaking science fiction. Neofeud is an adventure-puzzle game that aspires to be complex, compelling, and challenging. Christian now lives on the Big Island of Hawaii with his loving, geeky, cosplaying Canadian wife, and two kids.</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWe're a little volunteer army working out of Section 8 and plumbing-free microhomes, so please consider donating through \r\n\tPatreon!
