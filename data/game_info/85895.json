Using a stacking strategy similar to Tetris, interactive note-blocks fall from the top of the screen and move toward the bottom. The player assembles these block to create 3-note chords--both vertically and horizontally. The notes and chords are integrated into a constantly shifting backing track.  This track allows the user to develop chord construction, and chord identification skills in a real life context, but also to experiment with improvisation and musical timing. <br/><br/>Music Theory-SoundSquares can be used as an ear training, or chord identification tool in the classroom environment, as well as individually.  Based on popular and world music models, and employing a Tetris-like strategy, the player will be introduced to familiar and unfamiliar music, and will be invited to find connections between the two.  <br/><br/>SoundSquares provides an interactive learning space associated with traditional Roman Numeral triad-driven chord progressions such as  I-IV,  I-V,   I-IV-V, as well as progressions that include partial 7th chords such as i7 (no 5th) and other inverted, partial, dominant and non-dominant 7th chords.  <br/><br/>Perfect for enhancing a traditional ear-training education, SoundSquares comes pre-loaded with two very different musical styles:  ROCK, which references \"Mellow\", \"Metal\" and \"Dubstep\" musical styles, and AFRICAN, which references both northern and southern East African musical styles. <br/><br/>The game is designed for downloadable content which will be added over the next few months and will include Chiptune, Vintage Game, Blues, Hip-Hop, VaporWave and other styles as well.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:21:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c14/c1432b13776ef7222b112b3a2094105c.jpg", "website": "http://unison-design.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Unison Design"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Unison Design"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
