Radical!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRace to the finish, avoiding sentient dystopian gun turrets that are, quite literally, loose cannons! Way past cool!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPush conveniently-sized crates filled with hovering skateboards, new formulas of your favourite colas and synthetic mullet wigs into the line of sight of those turrets to sneak past undetected! Killer!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGrab the pick-up sticks in each level, because entertainment doesn't get much better than that! Tubular!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd win as speedily as your fluorescent running shoes can take you to beat each star rating and win up to 5 stars in each level, because there's no such thing as 3 star ratings in the 80s - mobile phones, as you all well know, are only for telephoning your home landline and making your pants fall down when you forget your belt! So bad!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's all there for you in Won't You Be My Laser, the fun, inexpensive little diversion set in the distant year 2000.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo head down to your local arcade with a pocket full of quarters and get ready to spend the night with Won't You Be My Laser!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n...or buy the entire game digitally off of this weird Steam thing that everyone's talking about.
