It features beautiful, hand drawn graphics and a well curated soundtrack. Expect five different endings, story-changing choices and plenty of drama.</p>\n<p>WOOF WOOF is for young adults due to coarse language and mature themes.</p>\n<p>For the best experience, you are advised to use headphones and play in full screen mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74e/74ef76c50011334e97b911824a2ebd83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["WoofWoof2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
