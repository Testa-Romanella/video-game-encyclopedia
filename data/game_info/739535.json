The unnamed occupant have been on this station for years, all alone. Needless to say, this has taken its toll on our poor protagonists mind. This occasionally shows in the dreams.<br />\nBut there are still glimmers of hope.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br />\nThe game relies heavily on atmosphere and mood to keep the player interested. You explore the mind of our protagonist via 4 possible pathways, which branch out, when you enter the dreamworld.<br />\nThe main focus lies in exploration and uncovering the past of the protagonist. There are a few puzzles among the way, which are usually not too hard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-15T18:48:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4a5363dcf90264f7f8df7582574ae5a.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/3993/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
