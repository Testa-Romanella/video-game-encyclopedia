Explore a village cursed with eternal darkness in your quest to restore the sun to its former glory.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\r\n</p><p>Dodge - Shift (Keyboard) / B (Gamepad), provides iFrames<br/></p>\n<p>Jump - Space\u00a0(Keyboard ) / A (Gamepad)<br/></p><p>Attack - F (Keyboard) / X (Gamepad)</p>\n<p>PROD v1.035 Notes:</p><p>- Added VFX and SFX to player dash ability</p><p>PROD v1.034 Notes:</p>\n<p>- Added death VFX to enemies and player (although she fades back to a checkpoint before they really play out)</p>\n<p>- Removed wall slide as well as wall jump bug (wall slide and wall jump still accessible in All Abilities Mode)</p>\n<p>- Added iFrames to ledge climbing but also increased the range of the Brute's sword swing so you can no longer just walk past him.<br/></p>\n<p>- The attack power-up now works!</p>\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<p>- Pause Menu is still being weird and Esc will not let you leave it, best to use the Close Menu button</p>\n<p>- Sometimes the player will randomly teleport to a different room. I cannot reliably reproduce this bug and have no idea what causes it, let alone how to fix it.</p>\n\n\n<p>PROD v1.033 Notes:</p>\n<p>- Modified opening text and added SFX to opening doors</p>\n<p>ISSUES: Menus are being weird, it's best to use your mouse to navigate them.</p>\n\n<p>PROD v1.03 Notes:</p>\n<p>- Possible crash(?) if the player takes damage while swinging their weapon. This may be resolved, more testing required.</p>\n<p>- Jittery room transitions.</p>\n<p>- Wall jumping, while not currently meant to be in, is still possible.</p>\n<p>- Wonky minor enemy AI.</p>\n<p>- SFX may be too loud</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T14:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1db3df20d6fd3037ef80091860dcc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioGenGen"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
