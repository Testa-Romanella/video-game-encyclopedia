The problem is that prior to the cleaning supply takeover there was a balance. The humans were always cleaning and in the process they would give Tuck their trash.\u00a0 Now the cleaning supplies eradicate any garbage that exists so Tuck no longer has landfills of his lovely trash to swim through.</p>\r\nHarold\r\n\n<p>I am not going to\u00a0elaborate on this one. His name is Harold and he is a happy little lad.</p>\r\nJoey Junk\r\n\n<p>Crumpled and forgotten. Was he a thrown away drawing? A paper toss\u00a0 in an office that missed the garbage bin?\u00a0 Maybe he was just the remains of a hamburger wrapper? No one knows, but Joey certainly doesn't care.
