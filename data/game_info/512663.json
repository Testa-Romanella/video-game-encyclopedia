My goal was to make a legit fighting game you can play in a browser. Has special commands, combo system based on links, high low blocking\u00a0the whole 9 yards. Only has 1 character now but If it's popular I'll add more.\u00a0 You can download the windows exe if you want to too. I wanted to emphasize skill so there is no combo damage scaling.
