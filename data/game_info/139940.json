And the answer was Chess!</p>\n<p>Made for #LDJAM40 for the 48hr challenge where the theme was:</p>\n<p>\"The more you have the worse it is.\"</p>\n<p>This is a simple chess board with some special rules:<br/></p>\n<p>When a player kills a zombie it leaves the board.</p>\n<p>When a zombie kills a player the zombie side gets that piece as a new zombie piece.</p>\n<p>4 Rooks, 3 Bishops, and two queens? Why not?!</p>\n<p>Due to the simplicity of the game no chess rules were implemented only turn rules, capture rules, and king rules. Pawn promotion (get a pawn to the other side of the board) is in place, but you only get a Queen. So you're expected to know how to play chess and move the pieces accordingly. This doesn't hold hands. :)</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>If you move a player piece on top of another piece of the same side it creates a massive movement bug.</p>\n<p>Board does not reset on game end. You have to reset the cart entirely (Enter then select reset) to get a new board.</p>\n<p>Down on the keyboard does not produce a movement sound.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/016ccb1f2946bf71e42e8ad14c029802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["4KbShort"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
