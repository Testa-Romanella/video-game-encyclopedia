Our task was to make a game using all that we learned this semester. The game had 2 main restrictions. One it had to revolve around a theme and two it needed to feature a specific animal. My animal was the Alaskan Bull Worm, there is no such thing in real life, so I researched the closest animal i could find. The Bobbit worm. Bobbit worms are fascinating creatures.\u00a0 As the title says, my theme was Professional cuddling. I chose this because I know that not many people would want to cuddle a worm.</p>\n<strong><em>How to play</em></strong>\n<p>My game has four levels, in level one and 3, you use your mouse to control where the worm goes. In levels 2 and 4, you use the spacebar to try and grab fishes to eat. Hold the spacebar down makes the worm go higher.</p>\n<em><strong>Assets</strong></em>\n<p>Here are some of the artworks that I made for the game. I made all of these with Piskel.</p>\n\n<p>A blue fish</p>\n\n<p>A red fish</p>\n\n<p>A purple fish</p>\n\n<p>And Bobby the Bobbit himself!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T18:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f482d8e0bf0af2359dd0dce179c35aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kiran M."], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
