Tested with WinUAE. Kick 1.3 or higher. (1.2 might also work)<br/>- <strong>Atari ST</strong>. Tested with Steem SSE. TOS 1.02, 1024K<br/>- <strong>(MS) DOS</strong>. Tested with DosBox<br/><br/>I got lost in cross-platform engine &amp; tool development and\u00a0in the end\u00a0did not have time to create the actual game.\u00a0;)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Arrow Keys to move.<br/>Space to attack.<br/>Escape to quit. (Works on Amiga and DOS. Might crash on Atari ST)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>As for the engine that was created for this jam:<br/></strong>It can export the same codebase\u00a0to Amiga 500/1200, Atari ST and (MS-)DOS and is basically a \"one-click\"\u00a0solution.\u00a0Sprites, Tilesets, Audio and Maps are auto-converted to be suitable\u00a0for the target platform. Maps are created in TilEd and then auto-converted to a custom binary format.</p>\n<p>As for the game: Well... i would not call it that. ;)<br/>Creating the cross-platform tech was super fun though and i will continue implementing other retro platforms just for the fun of it\u00a0(PSX, PC-98, SNES, Genesis ...)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I did not have time to implement doors to the other maps. If you want to play the other maps, just rename the map you want to play to \"Dungeon3.map\". You can find the maps in the ./assets/maps folder.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Art</strong><br/>Dungeon Interior\u00a0https://worldofnoel.itch.io/dungeon-interior<br/>Zelda Clone\u00a0https://bryantmakesprog.itch.io/tutorial-zeldaclone<br/>Happy little Adventure v2.0\u00a0https://momen-games.itch.io/happy-la-v2-ts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T04:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8654a019117b51ccf894b466c86ab5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dotmos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
