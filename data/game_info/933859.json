You have to save him from Mr. Bunny.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"AfroPenguin &amp; The Forbidden Ramen\" is a challenging argentinian 2D adventure game which pays homage to those Nintendo titles that made us smile as a kid (and why not, as adults). It has 4 levels (plus two unlockables called \"demo levels\" so you can see how much the game has improved since its early stages). It is in Spanish and English, and you can play it with a keyboard, mouse, or any joystick. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI hope this game makes you smile and have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSoundtrack by Joshua Morse and Dominic Ninmark.
