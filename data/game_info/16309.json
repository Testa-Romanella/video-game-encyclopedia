In this colorful puzzler, balloons have escaped and you must pop them all before they get away. You get points for each popped balloon and additional points for grouped balloons or for popping balloons of identical color. Balloons come in different colors and some have funny facial expressions, while others contain surprising powers. Experienced balloon-poppers seeking the ultimate challenge can test their skills in Survivor Mode, where the objective is to gain as many points as possible before 20 balloons escape.KEY FEATURES<ul><li>Amusing balloons with funny faces<br/></li><li>45 challenging balloon-popping levels<br/></li><li>Points- and star-system<br/></li><li>Hilarious sound effects<br/></li><li>Survivor mode with endless play</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T02:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d69d515e58d3f2384b6738cc1eea17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.46, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 316, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
