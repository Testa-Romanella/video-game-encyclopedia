Within its subterranean halls there are rumored to be great secrets of knowledge and artifacts of long lost technology. Within, too, there is danger, for the Nomorian builders did not leave their secrets unguarded. To get to those secrets, one must navigate the dark passages, avoid its sleepless sentries, and defeat the guardian at its core. With such treasures, one could reshape this world, revolutionize industry, and transform society\u2026.</p><p>...Ehh, but what am I telling you this for, thief?
