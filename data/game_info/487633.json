Upon seeing the JAX spacecraft, he immediately saw that it would not be easy. The Z-Caravella that was invading district 12 was THE OCTAVIUS, the oldest and most hostile pirates of all time, where 8 of the captains of 8 different captaincies abandoned their crews to create the greatest tyranny PIRATE OF THE GALAXIES, created especially to find the most legendary treasure: THE TREASURE OF HORUS, some say that it is a tool of the gods that has the power to travel in space in a fold like never before.</p>\n</em></em><p><em><em>But, it was not the first time that JAX saw the OCTAVIUS, since the first time that their destinies crossed was when Jax was still young and his village was destroyed in a failed attempt by the OCTAVIUS to use the HORUS treasure. JAX was the only survivor due to one of the HORUS treasure fragments being stuck in his chest during the collision. Since then Jax has never forgiven and devoted his life to eliminating criminals like these on behalf of his family as a MARTIANO RANGER.</em></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:46:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c78/c78d0213d048e239f1102c5211c89e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uranyon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
