Every enemy has its weaknesses and resistances, I designed at least one combination of attacks to defeat any enemy, but there could be more.</p>\n<p>With the exception of a certain item and a certain part of the game, it is not possible to use restoring items during battle. So be sure to always heal after a fight.</p>\n<p>As of now, there are only two endings achievable.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/>The full credits can be found inside the game and in the text files.</p>\n<p>Music by:</p>\n<p>- Eric Matyas @ Sound Image</p>\n<p>- Patrick de Arteaga @ Patrick's Music</p>\n<p>Art by:</p>\n<p>- Soramani</p>\n<p>- VIBRATO</p>\n<p>-\u3010CLOSET http://eurs.blog65.fc2.com/\u3011</p>\n<p>Font \"Ghastly Panic\" by Chad Savage @ Sinister Fonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T19:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a050bc9858f532e7c0347a3140f59ef9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cutie Jules"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
