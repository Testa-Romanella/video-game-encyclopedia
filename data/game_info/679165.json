The music adapts to the situation and dynamically mixes in and out new tracks as enemies spawn or die or when the player uses spells.</p>\n<p>The game does not have an ending and the difficulty gets only easier as the waves (which are not counted) go on as the player gains more mana and new spells. After three waves you've pretty much seen everything the game has to offer gameplay wise.</p>\n<p>WASD moves and mouse aims.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T06:28:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3eae975c81afc6c7629e5df4fc70334d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["spicy42"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
