Enemies telegraph their targets and attacks before combat, and can be recruited into your undead army once defeated.

In the unit collection, drag a unit into the top-right to add them to your current roster. Damage is not healed between fights so try to keep your units alive.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Q - Ability</p>\n<p>E - End turn</p>\n<p>A - Move</p>\n\n<p>Bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>UI not properly scaled outside of fullscreen</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e11/e11e958bfcd385d57df23e76dae81b3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SciathDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
