You can gain stamina from several plants or items through the map.</p>\n<p><em><strong>CURSE INDICATOR</strong></em>: The pink bar and the pink timer will show you the curse progess. If the pink bar is full and the timer will reach 0 the player dies. You can reduce the curse progress with the blue candles.</p>\n<p><em><strong>TIMER</strong></em>: In a separate box there is the timer and it shows you how long did it take to complete the current level.</p>\n<p><em><strong>REWIND CRYSTAL</strong></em>: If it reaches 0 and you die again than the game is over. You can gain Rewind Crystals through the levels.</p>\n<p><em><strong>TOOLS</strong></em>: In the game there are 2 throwable items.

If you hesitate too much the curse will kill the protagonist.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n\n<p><strong>You can play this game with a keyboard or a gamepad.
