You have limited turns, and I think the levels turned out a bit difficult, so have fun with the challenge!\r\n</p><p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>(I'm writing them here\u00a0in case you don't get the UI, which actually is very intuitive\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0The UX designer in me)</strong></p><p>Use the panels to set a force and direction for the dots. There are two dots and two panels for them respectively.\u00a0</p><p>Click on execute to execute that command. You have a limited number of turns for this.</p><p>You can select multiple arrows at the same time. This allows for diagonal jumps. However\u00a0selecting both right and left arrows will nullify the effect and the dot will not move.</p>\n<p><strong>Hints for if you get stuck on anything because I might not be as good of a level designer as I think:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. You can execute the same moves in quick succession to get a large boost\r\n</p>\n<p>2. You can execute moves in the air, wherever you are, no matter what velocity the dots are at\r\n</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Not all parts of a level are meant to be used, some of them are soft locks and you have to reset them\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you like my game\r\n</p>\n<p>ps I accidentally uploaded the screenshots twice, idk how to remove them sry\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T19:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4c/f4c0f915d4aaab7c177952eead8a2e25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kulfi13"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
