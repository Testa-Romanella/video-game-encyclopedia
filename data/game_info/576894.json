Build your decks and defy opponents on the battlefield.</p>\n<p><strong>One more card game?</strong> Well, yes. But in TDDG, everything is done in real-time. No need to wait your turn, most of the strategy is done in advance, while you are designing your deck. During the game, create the most efficient property and send your troops to defeat your opponent.</p>\n<p>A deck is made of 90 cards, split into 9 layers (levels). Starting with the cards of the lowest level, you slowly get experience and unlock higher level cards on the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Early, but (hopefully) bug-free</strong>. Even for a pre-alpha game, the purpose of a game is to have fun. That's why it is expected that new versions are enjoyable. A new release is made every Monday, adding new features and more content. It is tested and should always work correctly!</p>\n<p><strong>Don't make your first steps alone.</strong> An in-game interactive tutorial was made so that you can learn the game without having to dig all information by yourself. The tutorial will help you understand the basic systems. Then it will be a lot of optimizing your deck!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>For now it's completely free. </strong>The pricing decisions will be done later. As for now, downloading the game gives you access to all features. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Play with your friends</strong>. Of course, there are not many players for now. Why not inviting your friends to play with you? Everyone is welcome. You can also join the Discord (https://discord.gg/XNwHCbV2), people there will be happy to play a game with you!</p>\n<p><strong>And last but not least.</strong> Your feedback is very important. Leave your comments here, or on the Discord. Your opinion will matter.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/125/125f86e523df6e3f6ff565a00b55e31f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nathan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
