So I had to do this new game in one day (started on October 30th to 31th). <strong>My main objective in this jam , was to adapt some Tale to a videogame, and use cinematics, not so much doing minigames nor puzzles, and no action at all.</strong></p>\n<p>I reused de dialog mechanism and objective system I created, but I have to lowered because the time was going out.</p>\n<p>So, I had to write my own new story, and the content of that story is in the game, not\u00a0here :). I have to thanks my daughter because she gave me some tips on the new story :).\u00a0 Also, led to a new story that I can expand in the future(I had other storys but they are bigger than this).</p>\n<p>Enjoyed this jam too much because I wanted to do something different, related to how can make narrative, or dialogs and cutscenes.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Stuff:</strong></p>\n<p>Developed with Unreal Engine 5<br/></p>\n<p>100% Blueprints (other games I developed where 100% C++ or the majority).</p>\n<p>Created a simple dialog system above the Epic Dialog System.</p>\n<p>Subtitles originally were using the Unreal ones, but I had to remake my own because some lack of desired functionality</p>\n<p>Worked with the level sequencer to film the final cutscene, adding it several events and lot of non-seen stuff, like starting dialogs, showing new things, preparing \"actors\"(actors that act hehe).</p>\n<p>GitHub:\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE: I did some several \"shortcuts\" to test faster. Do this ONLY if you finished the game :).</p>\n<p>with keys 3 to 0 you can navigate thought the sites. And with the \"N\" key you can see the final cutscene, this is good if you want to repeat quickly some actions.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T16:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83f/83fe2c78656baf1bd67bc106f74e802c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShadowDrone"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
