It's hard. It's really hard and it's going to put your ambidexterity to the test. Choose from 8 characters, 8 levels, there's like 5 catchy 8-bit songs, I don't know, what are you waiting for? It's gonna be super fun and all your friends will think you're really cool when you drop Watergate trivia on them like how G Gordon Liddy ate a rat once.  Anyway, call your friends, invite them over, pour some glasses of your favorite beverages, and play some Watergate Xtreme.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/232df26c51021f6883496801d36e2ee9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 49, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Will Carlough"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Will Carlough"], "esrb_rating": null}
