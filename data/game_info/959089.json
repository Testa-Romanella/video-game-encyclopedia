{"id": 959089, "slug": "fablekeeper", "name": "Fablekeeper", "name_original": "Fablekeeper", "description": "<p>Fablekeeper is a game focused around creatures called Fables and working with them to grow both as a keeper and in riches. Each battle earns you legacy and your goal is to create the greatest operation in the Fableverse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've always been fascinated with somewhat darker themes and the golden compass. As such, one mechanic I think is somewhat unique is this idea that losing a battle isn't something to take lightly. Each loss takes away lifeforce from your fables and as such, losing enough will cause your Fable to fade into the Fableverse, where you will earn whatever legacy it had accrued. So you will need to be careful with what you fight and how you fight it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game is currently VERY alpha. I wanted to create a core game loop and work from the bottom up, consistently shipping updates, balances, and much more content. At this stage, it's more a taste of what's to come and it will be currently presented, pretty roughly. I always had the issue of ideating a million features and struggling to figure out what to work on, so with this, I am hoping by focusing on the core, I can slowly introduce features the community is most interested in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you'd like to follow development, please checkout my discord here:\u00a0https://discord.gg/braymen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T22:41:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1a/f1aa69ce98eedcee6e0453ac8ddcc395.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Braymen"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
