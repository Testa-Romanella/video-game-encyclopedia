Supports gamepad and\u00a0keyboard controls.</p>\n<p>Definitely still some bugs in there and a couple features got left behind, but I'm quite satisfied with the current state of the project. Took 1 week to build. I sort of went for a retro 8/16 bit theme (because it's easy when you suck at art like me).\u00a0It's not true to either of those, but it is all 8-bit sound effects and pixel art.\u00a0<br/><br/>The music is mostly by users nene and Wolfgang of opengameart. Everything else (except for a couple sound effects) are made by me.<br/>https://opengameart.org/users/nene<br/>https://opengameart.org/users/wolfgang</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:53:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/944345401b44079df57e757b8e434dc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jimmy Russell"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
