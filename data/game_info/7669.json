Water, Oil, and Lava fall from Droppers and bounce around the walls of the puzzle. You move and rotate various types of bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges in order to divert the flow of the falling droplets. The faster you complete each of the 50 levels, the more bonus points you receive.<br/><br/>The physics in Enigmo are truly amazing to watch!  This is one of the most unique puzzle games ever created.<br/><br/>In addition to the 50 levels that come with the game, you can also download many more levels for free!  As of version 1.1, you can download levels created by other users or by yourself with the Mac or PC version of Enigmo which has a built-in level editor.  You may submit your levels to us and we'll include them in the public list if we like them enough.<br/><br/>_______________<br/><br/>Watch the behind the scenes video:  http://pangeasoft.net/iphone/behindthescenes.html", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T01:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b1/3b1072c132f67d4cff259adf66ea0380.jpeg", "website": "http://www.pangeasoft.net/iphone/enigmo", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 436, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Pangea Software"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["MumboJumbo", "Pangea Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
