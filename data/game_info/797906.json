{"id": 797906, "slug": "dream-walk-mortgage", "name": "Dream Walk: Mortgage", "name_original": "Dream Walk: Mortgage", "description": "Dream Walk: Mortgage is a casual arcade-style game that focuses on quick maneuvering and simple multitasking. While avoiding bad-guys, petting cats, and collecting sunflower seeds, you must also remember to collect interest on your dream-dollars by clicking the interest button. But don't click it before it's ready or your credit score will be penalized!<br/><br/>Use the money you accumulate to buy shoes to make you faster, and new dream-houses that will appreciate in value to grant you even more dream-dollars.<br/><br/>Getting hit by bad-guys will cause you to grind your teeth! If you run out of teeth, you'll wake up (game over). You can always buy more teeth though! Just like in real life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-15T14:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658da65fd047a6dc40960e1685f72494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Half Map Games", "HalfMapGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Half Map Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
