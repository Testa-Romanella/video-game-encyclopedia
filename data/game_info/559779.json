Players never know what's around the corner and the more rooms and monsters we add, the harder it is for players to guess.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Game is in pre-pre-pre alpha release (3 pre's)<br/>Absurdium is a No-Budget solo project.<br/>Tipping helps fund the game (and me) so I can pay artists to do the work i can't do. The game will be free with donation until the full release in which I'll try and make the cost as low as I can. </p>\n<p><em>The full game will include constantly updated monsters,lore and rooms and a secret ending. This version will always be playable even after the full release.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T07:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d8b7de4696184ec7b7ac5ef049340dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EpicBunny"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
