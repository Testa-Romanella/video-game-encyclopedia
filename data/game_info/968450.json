Before Sunset is a game inspired by an old village me and my sister used to visit, the hometown of our grandparents. We had one of the best memories there, and creating Before Sunset became a must as a tribute to our childhood. <br/><br/>It's been a long 1.5 years of hard work, me and my game artist has been aiming for this game to be a complete step up from our previous game Noctambulant.<br/><br/>We are very excited to finally launch the game. Enjoy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T06:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e81/e8117b2b82e62b6765ae897a49fa7ce8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justus Yew"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jarze Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
