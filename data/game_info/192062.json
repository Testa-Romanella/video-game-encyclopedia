I choose a pretty simple concept to try and finish it quickly (that didn't happen). I actually built the game once, realized my original design prevented a feature I wanted to include, and then built the game from the ground up again. After hitting another roadblock, I abandoned the project until recently.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/988/98868b9a7616761046a339c87b0aaf62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mdhProtos"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
