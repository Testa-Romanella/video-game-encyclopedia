One day, however, you find that someone from Sorlen has kidnapped your beloved while you were out patrolling! You have to try and save her before her kidnapper gives her to Sorlen, kills her..or does something far worse to her.</p>\n<p>Demlin and Marzipan is a game made in Twine by Livia Langley (Sleepy Dreamer). The cover art and inspiration for this game was taken from the artist Scott King (who is peabug on Tumblr). </p>\n<p>Since it's a Twine game, everything should work smoothly, but if you have any problems, please feel free to comment here or email me at livialangley@yahoo.com! I'd be more than happy to help you out.</p>\n<p>I hope everyone enjoys playing this little game about a Knight and her girlfriend, the spirited Princess.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8e/c8eaa40c8183653507b5615bcc530aa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Sleepy Dreamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
