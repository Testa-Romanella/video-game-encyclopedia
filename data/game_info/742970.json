We have a forest biome, a biome made entirely from diamonds, and a volcano biome. These three different biomes are what make up this new dimension that you landed in. In each of the biomes, you will learn interesting facts and fight through the stages. Within each level, there are different enemies, with ranging power and health. The first level is the forest level. The name of the biome is called Evergreen Winter. This forest is filled with ninjas. After this level, you move onto the second level, the diamond level. The name of this biome is called Sunset Diamond. This area is covered in hard, almost indestructible diamonds. With the enemies adapting to this area, they have an increased health buff. Finally, after defeating both Evergreen Winter and Sunset Diamond, you move onto the final stage. The final level is called Infernal End. This area has an active volcano, ready to burst at any moment. The enemies here have increased power from living in a desolate, dangerous area. However, once you finally defeat all three biomes, you have successfully beaten the game. Along the way, you have learned all the facts included in the biomes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Use A or D to move left or right<br/></p>\n<p>space to jump</p>\n<p>left-click to shoot</p>\n<p>To wall climb,\u00a0 hold space then press the opposite\u00a0directional key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:42:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06f/06f55ebd48453311a41473c0f90d4d0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["newwebber"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
