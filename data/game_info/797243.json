You also need to play in fullscreen to see the whole game.\u00a0One of the issues I'm having is not being able to hit the boss. I just had normal enemies die on getting hit, and when I tried to implement health for the boss, I ran into trouble and am sadly to busy to fix it before the deadline, so I removed components on the boss and currently you just run into him to beat the game. Also there's no music, it's not a bug. (Updated it and I got the walls to work so now you can only go through doors so you enter a room instead of being offscreen of the camera)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a3059813e53cbae71ad6cd51123eb998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["osrick97"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
