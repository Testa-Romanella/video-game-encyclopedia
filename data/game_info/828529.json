{"id": 828529, "slug": "pick-a-side-3", "name": "Pick a Side!!!", "name_original": "Pick a Side!!!", "description": "<p>The theme of the 2022 GeoJam was \"Pick A Side.\" I wasn't able to follow the time frame for making a game for the GeoJam, but the jam and theme still inspired me to create this game: Pick A Side!!! Instead of the geometric meaning of picking a side of a shape, I took a whole other meaning of the theme of \"Pick A Side\" like choosing a side for a dish at a restaurant. Thus, I created a game similar to Overcooked where you have to complete tickets in which the orders are different shapes, but you only have to pick the sides for each ticket!</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p> To play Pick a Side, you have to \r\n complete as many tickets as you \r\n can as quick as possible with no \r\n mistakes! Every couple of seconds, \r\n you will get a new ticket, but \r\n the only part of the ticket you \r\n have to complete are the Sides! \r\n Each ticket might include an appetizer, \r\n main course, or dessert, but your only task is \r\n to follow the sides order. Click and drag the\r\n correct shapes into the tray on the right and \r\n hit the check to finish the ticket. However, \r\n if you take too long or get the sides wrong, \r\n you will lose a tray! You only have three extra \r\n trays so be careful and pick a side!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T03:36:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bd626fa478a3b612ed584e5f36a0fff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KarlVM12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
