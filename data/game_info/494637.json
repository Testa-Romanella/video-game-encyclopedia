{"id": 494637, "slug": "cemetery-roots", "name": "Cemetery Roots", "name_original": "Cemetery Roots", "description": "<p><em>See below for How to Play instructions</em><br/></p>\n<p>This is my second game jam entry. It's for Weekly Game Jam 166, where the theme was \"roots.\" I ran with the theme and ended up creating a game where you have to try to dig up roots before they turn into...zombie trees you have to fight. You gain tokens for defeating enemies, which can be used to purchase better weapons.<br/></p>\n<p>The systems I wanted to implement in the game turned out to be a lot more complex than expected. As a result, I did not finish. I hope to get back to the project and add the following</p>\n<ul><li>SOUND! There is no audio at this point</li><li>Hit/Impact Effects - it is currently not very clear when the enemy is hit</li><li>Enemy Health Bars - it is unclear how much damage is being done and how much health the enemy still has</li><li>More weapons - I only managed to add one to the store, leaving just two weapons total</li><li>Greater variety of enemies</li><li>Some sort of 'dash' or extra control function - currently player can only move left and right</li></ul>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Try to dig up roots before they turn into more powerful enemies! By destroying roots or full grown enemies, you receive tokens to purchase upgrades. Try to survive as long as you can. Once the health bar (heart in top left corner) reaches zero, it's game over.</p>\n<p>A - Move Left<br/>D - Move Right<br/>Left Mouse Button - Attack<br/>Right Mouse Button - Dig (to attack roots)<br/>Scroll Wheel - Change Weapon<br/>Esc - Pause<br/>Tab - Open Store Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:22:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce688f08e8141cd70dcd5dd0b04e3334.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fc85057"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
