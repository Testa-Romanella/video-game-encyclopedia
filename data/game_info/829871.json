However, if you are stuck, and want to see all the content the game has to offer, you can either use the skip as checkpoints, or to skip a boss you just can't beat.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T13:20:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4344d4a13e82925116b79fc113b511b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cosmocorner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
