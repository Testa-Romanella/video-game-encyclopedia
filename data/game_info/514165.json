Here are the implemented ones tho:</p>\n<ul><li>Swipe to jump, get close to edges to hang from them, jump upward from edges and use the jiggle from hanging back on the edge to boost your next jump. There's about .5s delay after releasing the swipe where the game checks if you jumped so it queues your jump so you can release swipe just before hitting the floor and the slime will jump as soon as it hits the ground</li><li>Arrow that is shown when swiping counts as health and stamina bar. Arrow head and each circle shown in the arrow represent gems. Each gem is 1HP and 2SP (each jump and power uses SP).\u00a0</li><li>Combine same and different powers mid air to get interesting results</li></ul>\n<em>PS. all powers are hidden in trees</em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d45b54319e3ce9c36b666db8eda616d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LuckyB45tard"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
