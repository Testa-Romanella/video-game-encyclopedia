However, it remained a year tradition to release a large game project on April 1st, which was the day in 2006 that I first got the idea to make a self-insert series. While the milestone itself was stupid, it did serve a good motivator to release unfinished projects. Since 2016 was supposed to be the 10-year anniversary of Alex X, I decided to make this game.</p>\n<p>Colby Jack's Revenge answers the question: What would my games look like in 2006 had I possessed the abilities I had by 2016?</p>\n<p>The plot of Colby Jack's Revenge is a very simple one, taking place a little while after\u00a0Colby Jack's Attack. Colby Jack, the evil mascot of Colby Jack's Pizzeria, is back to his old plans of kidnapping children and using them to make robots. However, he is also after a mysterious artifact called the Planet Egg, which he believes holds an infinite power supply for his ambitions to take over the world. Alex once again dons his booster seat powers and saves the day!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:30:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a6e9957f90e547c6a8a03cab6dd50b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["algamedev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
