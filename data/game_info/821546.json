I suck at coding but I was planning on doing the bare minimum like a menu and a highscore, but Unity just wouldn't let me test anything out today. So, I gave up and made it thematically appropriate with the GMTK 2022 Game Jams theme, Roll of the Dice, I rolled low in real life hence the game's title.</p>\n<p>In the game you shoot a dice at randomly spawning enemies (Not sure if this works either, couldn't test it out) and depending on what you role a random shot will happen. You're enemies are smaller dices that roll around too, use your big dice to deflect and deal damage to kill the smaller dice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:27:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a85/a857695da8f6d672352c9e25a4e4a150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aliveish"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
