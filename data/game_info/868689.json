This is the first game I made a while ago. It's more a prototype than a finished game, but maybe you'll have some fun with it.</p>\n<p>Feedback about the game and the general game concept is highly appreciated.<br/></p>\n<strong>Gamemodes:</strong>\n<ul><li>Classic</li><li>Conquest</li></ul>\n<strong>Classic:</strong>\n<p>A normal game of chess.</p>\n<strong>Conquest:</strong>\n<p>The goal of the conquest mode is to conquer every region on the map.</p>\n<p>This is done by moving your armies to enemy regions. But don't forget your defence. Distribute your armies over your regions to build a solid frontline.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving and buying armies:</strong></p>\n<p>To move or buy armies click on one of your regions. In the popped up menu you can buy armies for this region or move existing ones to another region. A region can have a maximum of 4 armies.</p>\n<p>The dotted lines on the map indicate where you can move to from a certain region. Once an army was moved your turn is over..</p>\n<p>When you move one or multiple armies to an enemy region a battle will begin. (only when there are troops stationed)</p>\n<p><strong>Castles:</strong></p>\n<p>Some regions are castles, marked by the castle icon. A castle can only be attacked\u00a0 with a larger army than the castle's.</p>\n<p><strong>Making money:</strong></p>\n<p>You earn money from your regions that have armies in it.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Gamedesign &amp; Programming<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>megaprokoli<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong></p>\n<p>Overworld:</p>\n<p>Shade<br/></p>\n<p>User Interface:</p>\n<p>PaperHatLizard<br/></p>\n<p>adwitr<br/></p>\n<p>Backgrounds:</p>\n<p>ansimuz<br/></p>\n<p>Chess:</p>\n<p>Dani Maccari<br/></p>\n<p>Misc:</p>\n<p>megaprokoli<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>INFINITY CRYSTAL: AWAKENING</p>\n<p>by Sara Garrard<br/></p>\n<p>SFX:</p>\n<p>FALLENBLOOD<br/></p>\n<p>irinairinafomicheva<br/></p>\n<p>FlashTrauma (Pixabay Music)</p>\n<p>dave.des (Pixabay Music)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:04:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbe3d39eab3414e91205e29c7d3ad9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["megaprokoli"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
