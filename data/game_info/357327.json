Inspired by a childhood obsession with Zelda games, this\u00a0was made entirely using\u00a0 HTML, javascript, and the P5 play libraries which allowed for easier graphics processing and usability. It's not much to look at, and performance gets very poor as the game runs, but I felt like sharing it to show my progression as a game developer. Hope you enjoy\u00a0this bootleg Zelda dungeon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:00:07", "background_image": "https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIzMjE3MzUucG5n/original/bVCPGf.png", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaristotle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
