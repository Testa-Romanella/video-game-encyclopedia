A place where only silence reigned now. Where the wind had stopped and the tides retreated with the Great Rift.

The lost reverberations of an empty throne...<br />\nAnd here I was, bathed in my mist of past and future memories, standing in this mythical place that remained, still. The only location anyone in Hypnos could have found with no map or compass back when the King still reigned.<br />\nAnd I Remember the Silence In My Soul.<br />\nThe Bitter Raindrops In the Wind. \u00bb</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2021-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-10T00:48:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f60/f6033f9760fe1317747d15bed66bf4b2.jpg", "website": "http://shatteredking-thegame.fr", "rating": 2.26, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 103, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redlock Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Redlock Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
