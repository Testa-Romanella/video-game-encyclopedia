The short game demo/prototype, just allows for the player to move around and have the ability to shoot enemies. The little level used assets which I found on the Unity asset store. As my main focus for this project was to work on improving my programming with creating the scripts for this project. This can be shown within this project and all my other projects on my Itch.io website.</p>\n<p>For the goal of this project I wanted the player to be able to destroy targets by shooting the targets more than once. To give the feeling that the enemies have health and do not die after colliding with one bullet. It also makes the game somewhat challenging for the player.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Potentially, for an final outcome of this project, I would like the enemies to spawn randomly or move randomly around the player. Just giving the player a reason to use the mechanic of moving and being able to aim.</p><p>All assets used for this game prototype, are created by\u00a0Tamarin Studios. I did not create any of the used assets.</p>\n<p>Assets Used:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/pro-western-starter-pack-46306</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T07:37:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb26425ee516546cdb81e53cc7b05647.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bradley M"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
