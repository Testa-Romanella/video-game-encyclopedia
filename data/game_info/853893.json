But, its a bit hot down there. Take care when battling the lord of the nine to not overheat, and pay attention to your heat bar.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that although an embedded\u00a0web version of the game is provided, I do NOT recommend its use, do to it's low sound and visual quality</em></p>\n<p>Made for the 3rd Vimjam in 10 days.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>In this game, you must defeat Asmodeus in his 3 phases. You have 3 actions to flip through: Move, Shoot, and Spin (a melee attack) but you can only have one active at a time. Each action will cause you to heat up, as will getting hit by an enemy. If you reach maximum heat, you will overheat and have to start over.</p>\n<p><strong>A/D/arrow-keys</strong> - switch between actions<br/><strong>Mouse</strong> - aim<br/><strong>Left Mouse Click</strong> - use current action</p><p><strong>How does this\u00a0submission fit the theme &amp; focus?</strong><br/>Only one action can be used at a time, and they are all used using the same input (left mouse button). Instead of having health, you have a bar indicating how hot you are. If you overheat (from activities such as using your actions or getting hit by an enemy) you will lose and have to start over</p>\n\n<p>All assets and programming by Fonkin S.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong><br/>Godot Game Engine<br/>Aseprite<br/>SFXR.me<br/>BeepBox.co<br/>Audacity</p>\n\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: This game contains Copyrighted material</strong>\u00a0<strong>owned by Wizards of Coast\u00a0(The name Asmodeus).
