It's a love letter addressed to a certain cowboy. It's a roadtrip with two lovers who will fight for each other and get to a happy ending.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2666 How ?</strong><br/>This game was made with Construct 2 and TV Paint Animation Pro. All visuals and the poorly executed guitar noises was made by myself, the birds and nature sounds come from\u00a0www.universal-soundbank.com<br/>This is the <strong>first half version</strong> of the game, for now it's only a sort of visual novel but later I'll add some cool little minigames to rythme the narration and make it more \"playable\" (even if I know a game doesn't HAVE to be playable but, anywyay, that's what I plan to do)</p><p>For now to play this game you only need a space bar and to sit comfortably \u2665</p>\n<p><strong>\u2666 Why ?</strong><br/>This little game was made for the <strong>Gay Western Jam</strong>, in december 2019.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u2666 Thanks !</strong><br/>to <strong>Robert Yang</strong>, for proposing this nice gamejam (and for his whole work in general)<br/>to <strong>my partner</strong> for their support and for helping me with text translations.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u2666 Why \"with no horse\"\u00a0?</strong><br/>When you think \"cowfolk\" you also\u00a0almost always think \"horse\".\u00a0Like, horses are important for the \"Western mood\". I like horses, you know. They are cool animals. I respect them. But I absolutely don't know how to draw them. So, no horses in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37d/37d6547a2db8a2fbe22b64d991e08b6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["El Lapi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
