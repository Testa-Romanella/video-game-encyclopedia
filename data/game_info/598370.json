It can be run from Windows or in a DOS window. Included in the game are detailed HELP instructions and HINTs in a form similar to invisiclues. These can provide a gentle nudge or a downright spoiler - the player's choice. Also inbuilt is full scripting, with the ability to view the script file in-game via the HISTORY command.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T07:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/3786164dea535e989eb978af61fca7b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Older Timer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
