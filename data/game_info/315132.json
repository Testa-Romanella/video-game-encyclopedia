Sadly we did not finish in time, there should be more \"action\" cards and an ending  but we ran out of time.<br/><br/>Your life is Currency, so you trade your currencies and build your deck in order to reach more modern currencies. Drag your cards onto the traders to purchase the shown cards. When you pay enough the cards get added to your discard pile. Try to unlock modern currency!
