This is how you play:<br/></p>\n<p>The goal is build your tower by\u00a0stacking rooms on top of each other\u00a0as high as you can before running out of resources. Only the top 5 rows of rooms are active throughout the whole game, so eventually old rooms do not require or provide resources.\u00a0 A rooms \"service\" (indicated by the number in the bottom right of the room) must be met before it can be pushed below the 5th row mark.</p>\n\n<p>Office Room - Costs 2k and 1 Staff, provides 2k each round its powered.</p>\n<p>Break Room - Costs 3k and 0 Staff, provides 2 service to rooms in its row, and 1 service to rooms in its column</p>\n<p>Server Room - Costs 5k and 0 Staff, provides 1 service to rooms in its column only if powered. If powered, provides 4 Staff when it\u00a0expires (moves from an active\u00a0row to inactive)</p>\n<p>Electrical Room - Costs 8k and 1 Staff, provides power to all rooms in its column.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T03:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dd/7dda6d27ed4f58fa3739b61885abbd29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Zokie0"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
