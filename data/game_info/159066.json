Respectively, each letter of the animal's name should be typed correctly before the animal reaches its destination. The related letter will be seen on the screen if you hit the right key. Otherwise, it won't be seen. After each stage, it notifies you whether you identify the animal. At the end of the game, it shows the total result. If you want to play again, you can simply click the restart button in the result screen. At the each new start, the sequence of the animals to be showed varies. The game was designed especially for the pre-school or new learner kids to help their writing skills in a funny way.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef6/ef6cb79f3c57ef22eca68e6369d74114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nfha"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
