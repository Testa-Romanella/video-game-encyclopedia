I created it to learn the basic mechanics of a platformer game. The game is very short but I learned quite a lot of new things which I can use for future games. I added a few levels just to finish a project. It is a nice feeling of completion and now my mind can rest and keep working on my other projects. If you have played the game then I am really grateful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If I have time I may expand this project. However, I want to move on and create other projects. <br/></p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n<p>Regards,<br/></p>\n<p>VR007</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T13:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f058d24e0f467d6d5f4fb0a1ff8c4a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["vr007"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
