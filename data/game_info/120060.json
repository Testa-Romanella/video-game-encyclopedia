It requires Cardboard VR and I recommend headphones.</p><p>I experimented with several color palettes for each image, so some things are more visible than others.  I will probably go back and make the palettes more consistent and push everything closer to the edge of visibility (in the less visible direction).</p><p>In the corner of your room there is another animation, but the bulk of the experience takes place outside of the window.</p><p>Audio from this project was selected for the <em>dronesTruck Audio Graffiti Project</em> of Hamline University in St Paul, Minnesota (2016).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f1/2f1232ad003389710c94b4d9641ef813.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["AaronOldenburg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
