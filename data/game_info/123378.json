Splitters cut sections from the window if you don't shoot them in time.  Collisions don't kill you but briefly freeze you and move the screen around your desktop to disorientate you. The game window gets gradually smaller making the gameplay increasingly frantic and claustrophobic. </p><p>Controls are 'Asteroid' like. Left and Right arrows rotate, Up arrow thrust and space bar or ctrl to shoot. </p><p>The game must be re-run to play again and the best time is displayed in the menu bar.</p><p>Dog Game #1 was designed with the following constraints. Black and white. Little or no text and menu. Windowed. </p><p>WARNING : Flashing</p><p>The Windows version was first released in 2012. I have now ported it to SDL2 and created a Mac version. If I have time I will look at making a Linux version. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/32042f420749601e0659cd213af81652.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["danblack"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
