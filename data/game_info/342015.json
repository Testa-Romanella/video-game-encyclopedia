I don't remember why I stopped working on it. I polished it for the Fragment Jam by adding the ability to exit, restart, and adding music and sound effects. It's effectively a complete game, although I wanted to add a lot more.</p>\n<p>The game took just under 6 hours total to make and polish.</p>\n<p>Saving the Earth is hungry work.
