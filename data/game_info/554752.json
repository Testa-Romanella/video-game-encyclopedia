{"id": 554752, "slug": "kanso", "name": "Kanso", "name_original": "Kanso", "description": "Kanso is your moment of Zen. <br/>A relaxing game of motion, pause, and flow.<br/>Immerse into a colourfully ambient space, effortlessly glide through each of the worlds, finding a growing sense of peace and a progression toward apotheosis.<br/><br/>Add Kanso to your wishlist to get notified of its release.<br/><br/><br/>Inspired by the Zen calligraphy practice of Ens\u00f4, where every day you paint an uninhibited ink circle on a blank sheet of paper.<br/>Expressing a physical moment of reflection, focus, and freedom of flow.<br/>Kanso is carefully balanced to invoke the flow of this calligraphic practice as a unique gameplay experience. <br/><br/><br/>Navigate through ten worlds and explore over three hundred levels. <br/>Each level with a different circular shape to follow and guiding energies to avoid.<br/>Move with each guiding energy, a Daemon following its own distinct movement pattern.  Some follow you, others avoid you, all of them moving in predictable paths that gently draw you into a tranquil gaming experience.<br/><br/><br/>Along the player\u2019s journey they will encounter our breathing session, a place where the Ens\u00f4 breathes along with you while calming music is played. <br/>Inspired by Resonant Breathing, the practice of slowing your breathing rate to approximately six breaths per minute. Slowing your heart rate variability, and resulting in a calm, de-stressed state of mind.<br/><br/><br/>Perfectly balanced for all input types, play with controller, touchscreen, mouse, or even a directional pad!<br/><br/><br/>I created Kanso to be a place of beauty and refuge from the noise of daily life.  To bring players of every skill level into a meditative state of flow, into an immersion of a calming experience. <br/><br/>I hope you join me and find your own moment of Zen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T02:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5aeba9062cfc0b6da0eab98669774a70.jpg", "website": "http://www.davesapien.com/DaveSapien/kanso.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Sapien"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dave Sapien"], "esrb_rating": null}
