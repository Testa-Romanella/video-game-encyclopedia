In normal mode, you fly with a top down view, and can see almost half the earth at any given time. In aviation mode, you can test your skills as if your were a pilot, seeing only a narrow view of the earth and seeing countries from far more obscure angles.<br/><br/>Study by flying around the world with country labels, and even find the shortest path to the country.<br/><br/>Check your progress by monitoring the <strong>Atlas</strong> to see which country locations you are particularly strong strong at, and which need some work.<br/><br/>Play with your friends and compete to get the highest score on the leaderboard!<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy my passion project, which involved figuring out the best ways to 3D model the planet to make a beautiful experience! I know some of the datasets containing country data might be slightly outdated, so please leave feedback and I will do my best to adjust the numbers.
