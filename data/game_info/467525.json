To keep it safe, you'll need to clear its path of obstacles, open doors, activate magic portals, and avoid traps. The Shambler's speed is also random - sometimes fast, sometimes slow!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D - movement</p>\n<p>Left click - Pull Items</p>\n<p>Right click - Push items</p>\n<p>Fly into switches to activate them.<br/></p>\n<p>The later levels can be difficult, but you can retry as many times as you like.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Please be gentle!
