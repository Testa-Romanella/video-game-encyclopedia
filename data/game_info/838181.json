This is the first game jam we've ever been in together and it might show by how sussy the game is. The robot's (AI) name is even Sussy (with a capital S and everything). I can't really describe to you how sussy this game is but it's so sussy to the point where it will have you questioning if you're an impostor or not... please enjoy the game! Rate it with your honest thoughts and opinions... Let us know if there are any bugs or glitches!
