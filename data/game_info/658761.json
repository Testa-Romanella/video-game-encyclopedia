I've been getting to grips with Godot for a while, using this game as a sort of practice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is simple: survive against waves of progressively-harder zombies, clicking on them to hurt and kill\u00a0them, and upgrade yourself in the process.\u00a0</p><p>Press \"P\" to pause the game. All other controls will be stated in the game(spoiler: there aren't that many)</p>\n<p>I probably won't add any updates, but any feedback would be taken into account for my future games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>1.
