It's a 2.5D dungeon crawler inspired by games such as The Binding of Isaac, DOOM 2016, From Software's souls games, Bloodborne, and most specifically, the Necromancer class from Diablo 2. I say specifically Diablo 2 as that's the one I played and enjoyed the most from the Diablo series, and also found most captivating.</p>\n<p>Most of the inspiration from the above\u00a0will be in philosophical, artistic and aesthetic decisions regarding game-making, but the format of the game could be easiest summed up as having the Necromancer class from Diablo 2 thrown into the level design of The Binding of Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is still in a very early alpha development phase, but I think so far there's enough to get an idea of what it'll look like once more features have been added. The project is almost entirely done by me (including programming, music, and art assets), save for some specific art assets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Key features still to come:</p>\n<ul><li>An item system / inventory / leveling system (all of which will be very similar in design to TBOI's item and leveling system)</li><li>Bosses</li><li>Greater scope of enemies</li><li>More levels / floors to traverse</li><li>Tutorials</li><li>More weapons and items</li><li>Game saves</li><li>Greater degrees of freedom in level traversal</li></ul>\n<p>Other features that would be cool to implement, feasibility willing:</p>\n<ul><li>NPCs / story quests</li><li>Multiplayer</li></ul>\n<p>If you enjoyed this game, please consider donating as this is something that I'd love to spent more hours of my weeks on, and also please do tell your friends if you think this is something they'd enjoy or be keen on supporting. Would love to hear your comments and suggestions. It's my first major game project so please be gentle. :3</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Much love,</p>\n<p>Aquila (V0ID).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-29T04:31:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde130115cdbf476ed1bfff1ec00bd2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["V0ID"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
