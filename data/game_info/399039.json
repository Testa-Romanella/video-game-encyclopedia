Also, you'll need to use the mouse during menus.<br/><strong><br/>Kyoei</strong> is a game about <strong>vainglory</strong>, samurais are fighting for a cause that exceeds them. Even if they win, both sides are losing units. The purpose of the game is to<strong> </strong><strong>not glorify the victory</strong>, because there is no victorious side in a war, but only a less losing one.<br/></p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong><br/><br/><br/>____________________________________________________________<br/><br/><br/>This game has been made in <strong>a month </strong>by a team of <strong>9 students from the Cnam-Enjmin</strong>:<br/><br/><strong>Producer\u00a0\u2022 Julien Sebbag<br/>Game Designers \u2022 Wissam Azzi (LinkedIn) \u2022 Victor Penon<br/>3D Artist \u2022 Ma\u00eblys Dubois<br/>3D Artist &amp; Animator \u2022 Quentin Dupuis<br/>Programmers \u2022\u00a0Becher\u2022 Th\u00e9o Olivier<br/>Sound Designer &amp; Music Composer \u2022 Damien Drouillard<br/>UX-UI Designer \u2022 </strong><strong>Ali\u00e9nor Blanc</strong><br/><br/></p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>You can contact us here: <em>kyoei.game.contact@gmail.com</em><br/>If you would like to contact one of us for professional reasons, please mention who you are reaching for in your mail object.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/193/193b922383ffa894690e1e7aaae791e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Vhalteix", "Becher", "quenth", "Alimelody", "leMouf", "Apoal", "Kinli", "Mvnyn", "Theo Olivier"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
