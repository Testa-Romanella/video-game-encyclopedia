Run the TinyGame3.exe executable file, and the game should begin!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Directions:\r\n</strong>Congratulations, you just time-warped back to the 1980s, but took Unreal Engine 5 along with you. Just read the instructions on the title screen to begin. You have 3 balls to start, so click your mouse to launch a ball and break all the bricks on each level. You get another ball each time you finish a level. Don't let your balls run out, and definitely keep your eye on your paddle, especially on the later levels.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>To move the paddle, just use your mouse.\u00a0</li><li>To launch a ball, press the left mouse button.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>If you reach the end or if you lose all balls, press Q to quit.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T15:58:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec1/ec1ec982ad553df3a1b8d98ab2345403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simple Shorts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
