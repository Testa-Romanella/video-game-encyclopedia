{"id": 501017, "slug": "binary-loop", "name": "Binary Loop", "name_original": "Binary Loop", "description": "<p>Binary Loop it's a platformer game where you control a robot that is stuck in a system loop. Your goal it's to break the loop by activating the switch button. Be careful with the obstacles that the system deploys to keep the loop alive. Each time the enemy goes in a loop, it's speed increases.</p>\n<p>This is my fisrt time trying to make a platformer type game; so I still have much to learn.\u00a0There are some possible collision bugs, and the physics of the main character feel a little clunky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to let me know if another undisered bug shows up. You can restart the level if you are stuck for bugs reason or if you feel that the enemy has reached an impossible speed. Just press the <strong>esc </strong>key to open the pause menu.</p>\n<p>I couldn't deploy the normal WebGL version of the game, the loading slidebar never ended, so I deployed a developer build version that works as fine as normal. You can download the Windows version if you want.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>This was created for the Ludum Dare 47 under the theme <strong>stuck in a loop.</strong></p><p>See the Ludum Dare submission page:.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:39:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb86ebfbcfd6befd3af4d6785f530740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["spiderhead20"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
