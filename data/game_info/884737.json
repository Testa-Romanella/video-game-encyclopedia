You can use the Quest, Quest 2 and Quest Pro goal cameras, to play, you do not need controllers. Playing without controllers is less accurate, but can be more fun...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDesigned for Pico 4, Oculus Meta Quest 2, Valve Index, Pimax, HTC Vive and Quest Pro PC-VR, Hands Tracking Mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T03:29:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe357d987cae634690af11da5760d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Agnuxo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Agnuxo"], "esrb_rating": null}
