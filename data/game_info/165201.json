I think this game did turn out very well considering my lack of knowledge of the engine.   </p>\n<p>This game is about a player that must run away from a bulldozer that is destroying trees and environment. This is Run for Your Life 2D there is also a 3D version created in Unreal engine please see my other games.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Please enjoy this prototype and have fun. Thanks for playing.\u00a0\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/8258495c0182ca4b3dce5effba59a598.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Burt"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
