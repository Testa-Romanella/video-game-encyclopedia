Without great ambition of course, but I worked hard, with a graphic artist friends for a long time to make a clean and reliable game engine, with more or less advanced enemies with different levels of AI. I spent a lot of time doing the basics of the game, and not enough to do the level and scenario. Building a game is a long and difficult experience, and that's when I realized that playing alone, even with the help of a graphic designer, is not enough! The game includes a level 1 and 2 complete and playable, as well as a level 3 experimental, but with AI very constructed and unbeatable if I do not correct the variables!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71cca1546db66da46701382eda5dbe4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["usernameHed"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
