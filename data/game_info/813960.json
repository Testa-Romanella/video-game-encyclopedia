{"id": 813960, "slug": "convic-challenge-underworld", "name": "Convic Challenge - Underworld", "name_original": "Convic Challenge - Underworld", "description": "<p>Each Pattern has its own unique behavior and principle of action that needs to be dealt with:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li><strong>\"Square\"</strong> is my favorite pattern (since I came up with it myself). At the beginning of this pattern, the outermost Thermal Plates ignite and this ignition moves to one point, creating the shape of a Square. After that, this very Square, as it were, \"floats\" all over the map and the player needs to keep up with it.\u00a0</li><li><strong>\"Sunshine</strong><strong>\"</strong> - (I hate him). In the center of the room, as well as the lines from it, Therm is lit. Plates creating the shape of the sun. This sun \"spins\" around its axis, which is why the player needs to run in time, then to the left, then to the right and react as quickly as possible to the movement of the rays of this damned \"Sun\".</li><li><strong>\"Tridents\"</strong> - at one moment, Tridents from Compressed Fire are shot at the player from all sides.\u00a0</li><li><strong>\"Vise\"</strong> - the most extreme Thermal Plates ignite and, as if the walls are moving towards the player. But at one point, these walls can go out, giving the player a moment to walk through them.</li><li><strong>\u00a0\"Cone\"</strong> - the whole room lights up, with the exception of a not so big island of Safety in the shape of a cone. This same cone with furious speed, spinning in the middle of the whole room. And the player here should move as fast as possible.</li><li><strong>\"Earth-Stop\"</strong> - at one moment the whole room can ignite with a bright flame, with the exception of a few islands. And the player has only a couple of seconds to have time to enter a small island of safety.\u00a0</li><li><strong>\"Base\"</strong> is the basic Pattern that accompanies a series of other Patterns. Simply, but no less ruthlessly, by complete chance, the Therm lights up. Plates near the player.</li></ol>\n<p>Every potentially dangerous item in this level, when damaging a player, instantly turns them into dark gray ash.\r\n</p>\n<p>And also the main feature of our level\u00a0is all kinds of variety of Patterns. And we can build any moment of the game into almost a different game, while spending as little effort as possible.<br/><br/>P.S. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f, \u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u043f\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u0412\u041a:\u00a0https://vk.com/nestestate<br/></p><p>P.S.
