With more modules, the mass increases, and the speed of movement decreases. Enemies are also such cores which scatter their weapons when destroyed, and if you've damaged their weapons, you also receive them in the damaged state. Occasionally, a boss spawns with lots of modules. Sadly, no levels were made and there's no interesting progression despite having 5 different modules.</p>\n<p>This was supposed to feel like a mix of a shmup and very casual version of Mechwarrior with different weapon groups to be repaired and fired independently, but the prototype didn't go that far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T05:25:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9e/a9e98ecdefeafe455fa5f07061c6a857.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xitilon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
