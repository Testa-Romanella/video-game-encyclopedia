You can't be hurt in Tiger-Snake form, but you cannot pick up items. Create a path that will allow your minions to collect treasure while keeping them safe from harm.\r\n</p>\n<p>Unlike other snakes, a Tiger-Snake can loop back on itself just fine, and won't be hurt by running into walls.\r\n</p>\n<p>To exit the level, you will need to collect keys. If none of your minions make it to the exit alive, you will lose a life.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Credits:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Snake by Lazy Fox\r\n</p>\n<p>https://lazy-fox.itch.io/snake-asset\r\n</p>\n<p>Tileset by Canari Games\r\n</p>\n<p>https://canarigames.itch.io/canaripack-1bit-topdown\r\n</p>\n<p>VFX by Ansimuz\r\n</p>\n<p>https://ansimuz.itch.io/warped-vfx-pack-1\r\n</p>\n<p>Tiger by Markiro\r\n</p>\n<p>https://markiro.itch.io/tiger\r\n</p>\n<p>Sprites by 0x72\r\n</p>\n<p>https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii\r\n</p>\n<p>Music &amp; EFX by Joel Steudler\r\n</p>\n<p>www.patreon.com/joelsteudler\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T08:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac30f25bdccce4a417eb5a72b272f83e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["SlightlyMadman"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
