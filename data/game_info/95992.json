Anyways, hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Guide:\u00a0 Go in the dungeon and at the end of each room you have 2 choices to \"save\" your loot, or continue forward with the risk of losing a lot. You can sell your kept loot to get yourself some souls and buy new swords! See if you can reach the final room!</p>\n<p>\r\nControls:\u00a0\r\nArrows - Move / S - Attack(hold/press) / Use mouse for the shop.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Game by Ryan Carag (Art, Music/sfx, programming)</p>\n<p>Programs used: Stencyl, beepbox, sfxr, Graphicsgale</p>\n<p>https://raiyumi.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d4f5f7c248ad5de9e2b58f220bded3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raiyumi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
