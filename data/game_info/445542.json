That's the character on the far left by the way (though I'm sure you could tell by the <em>healing</em><em> sword</em>). <br/></p>\n<p>The main idea with the gameplay is to manage your resources (cast time and mana) to help your team survive as efficiently as possible (though there is a lack of spells and monsters right now).<br/>Otherwise I'm not sure  what I'll do with this, I'd like to have a way to pick spells,  have a roster management and maybe some morale management as well.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Each spell has its mana cost on its top left corner and its power shown below it (healing or damage). There can be an icon in the top right corner as well to indicate if the spell is <em>slow</em> (takes more cast time) or <em>flash</em> (instantaneous cast but limited to one per turn).<br/>Select a spell and then a target. Make sure you have enough resources (cast time <em>and</em> mana). Press that <em>End Turn</em> button when you want to end your turn. <br/></p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>- Monsters Creatures Fantasy (the <em>bad guys</em>) by LuizMelo<br/>- Bandits (that's <em>your allies</em>) by Sven<br/>- Animated Pixel Adventurer (that's <em>you</em>) by Rvros<br/>- Action RPG Music by VGcomposer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T02:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7e9d85c6470d726aba84ed4b450100.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ptafix"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
