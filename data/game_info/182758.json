It's a battle between 2 character of The memories within, Nyx and Lili. I had fun doing this so I hope you'll have fun watching it. This is more a video then a game since it's an auto battle. You don't have to push any button except the start button. Do not prepare the pop corn because it's only a 2 minutes video. ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa065028087c52cb1f48cf7b0008e1c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hatepool"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
