The idea was born out of a small puzzle world.</p><p>I thought, what would happen if you had a puzzle game where you could escape a small world, then it became this.</p><p>There are multiple colors, you only control one at a time (with WASD), and hit space to switch. You can use blocks to stop you.</p><p>There are sadly only 7 levels, but they are pretty good, so hope you like them.</p><p>This is my 9th LD, 2nd Compo. Thanks for playing! Hope you enjoy, and good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/edee54780d85db61d1e1f82252dabf93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ajay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
