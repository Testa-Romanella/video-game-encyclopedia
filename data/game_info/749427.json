If you pay attention, you can notice the discrete decrease in quality as I rushed more and more after realizing that I may have made a project too large to complete in the time limit. This is very buggy, and if you look closely you may notice that the Furies have been replaced with Toothless from HTTYD, due to the lack of models and the fact that my teacher said that he would work. There is also a distinct lack of animations if the models did not come with them (I hate animating things). This project comes with the bonus of completely out of context book quotes if you don't have my in-class verbal essay to go along with them. To transition between scenes, fly into gates/the giant foggy holes in the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I don't know the exact minimum specs for this, but the highest hardware usage is easily the GPU. As long as you stay low to the ground, your GPU usage decreases somewhat if you are having lag issues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Go give this guy money, he let me use the highest quality model in this entire project (Cerberus):\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/creatures/cerberus-animated-...</p>\n<p>There is a tested and stable windows version, but there is also a completely untested Mac version if you want to try it out.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T07:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9e/f9e8cfac0984925d2834c47725ec3978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nc543"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
