A seriously challenging game that lets you select a ship to suit your play style from super fast fighters to heavy bombers.<br/><br/>The color and art style used in Defender 3D are reminiscent of the newspaper articles and feared space ships landings of the American Mid west in the 1950s. The game play is tuned to perfection with flowing fast paced, edge of your seat action.<br/><br/>Dont get to used to who you are battling as new bosses and alien crafts will replace the current enemies on a monthly basis!<br/><br/>There are no hand outs here. You need to earn every reward!<br/><br/><strong>COMING SOON</strong><br/>Build your own 3D ship model, name it and have it added to the game! Your ship will be available for all players to use. New ships will be posted in the forum and the weekly vote winners ship will be added each Friday.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11f/11f0dde330131095e39982019d141d80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blueshift Media"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blueshift Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
