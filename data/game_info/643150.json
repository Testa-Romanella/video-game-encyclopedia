We present the truest to life training scenario from the audio environment to equipment interaction and lighting to accessories. Interactions are closely modelled on the real life-saving equipment for the most accurate and available learning.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur VR approach to training exploits the capabilities of immersive technology to put the participant in the most convincing environment without using a single consumable or taking life-saving devices out of operation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T02:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87f69f044b7ed0209af1b4b93f68b76a.jpg", "website": "https://www.valleygeneral.hospital", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valley General"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Valley General"], "esrb_rating": null}
