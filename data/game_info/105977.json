{"id": 105977, "slug": "blackfisk", "name": "blackfisk", "name_original": "blackfisk", "description": "Description\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tblackfisk is a game where you shoot stuff, and grow! The more you grow, the harder the game is! With two button controls, great music, and tons of enemies and bosses, you can endlessly play this game! You play as Joshua and you go joshing everyone!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis was made for Ludum Dare 34 in about 48 hours so this is nowhere near a finished-quality game. This LD had the themes \"Two Button Controls + Growing\" as two themes tied. However, there is a polished version we made after the competition to make things smoother, but this is still very much prototype-quality. We recommend you play that, as it is more stable, but feature wise, they are both the same. Make sure you check out the README listed below before playing.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tPreston Cammarata (Acerio) - Programming + Art - cammarata.info\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tArthur Cosentino (X27) - Programming + Art + Sounds\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMark Sparling - Music - marksparling.com/\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTest Tube graphic by \r\n\tFreepik from Flaticon is licensed under CC BY 3.0.
