You need to feed your ostrich, \n      take care of it and improve its lifestyle.\n    </p><p>\n      Well-fed with seed, your ostrich will lay eggs which can then be sold to \n      the Shopkeeper. With this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmers\u2019 \n      Market.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      So, the aim of the game is to increase your money counter by selling \n      eggs and other farm produce, so as to buy more livestock at the Farmers\u2019 \n      Market and purchase equipment for your farm from the Shopkeeper. Little \n      by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses: a \n      wind turbine, a totem, a guard dog, a jeep, a barbecue, etc.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T03:41:26", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["BiP media"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Plug In Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
