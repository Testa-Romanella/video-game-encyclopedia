I have no game development experience.  I took a few days to learn how to use RPG Maker and this is the what I was able to give so far. My purpose for this project is to send a message off to other YouTubers into making their own video game.</p>\n<p><strong>Story:</strong> You play as yours truly, PhuCat, and the kitty slayers have invaded the small world of kitty saviors. You must fight off the serial killers and defeat the final boss to complete the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay: </strong>There's not much to explain. You can take your time and interact with a bunch of items and/or fight a bunch of enemies in a terrible battle system.</p>\n<p><strong>Side note:\u00a0</strong>The serial killers featured in this game are from the Puppet Combo franchise. Be sure to support his Patreon if you are interested in playing against those individual enemies. https://www.patreon.com/puppetcombo <br/></p>\n<p> <strong>YouTube channel</strong>: https://www.youtube.com/user/PhuCatGeek</p>\n<p><strong>For Future Projects:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/PhuCat</strong> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3c/a3cc13461c1b497f2d8c45bab1f3eda0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhuCat"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
