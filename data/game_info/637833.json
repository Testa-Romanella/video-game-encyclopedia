{"id": 637833, "slug": "trouble-on-the-corner-of-sugar-spice", "name": "Trouble on the Corner of Sugar & Spice", "name_original": "Trouble on the Corner of Sugar & Spice", "description": "<p>Originally created in 10 days for Art Fight 2020: Sugar vs. Spice, <em>Trouble on the Corner of Sugar &amp; Spice</em>\u00a0 is a mass attack project that's since been polished up into a playable demo.<br/></p>\n<p>What does any of that mean? Well, to make a long story short I asked a bunch of people on the Discord server to loan me their OCs, and then I crammed them all into a single project. Toss in some server in-jokes here and some public-domain music there, and you've got a crossover game between more than twenty different narratives.</p>\n<p>If that sounds overwhelming - don't stress! You don't need any prior knowledge of Art Fight or its competitors to understand this game.<br/></p>\n<p>-------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Point-and-click action</strong>: explore Sugar Street, gossip with locals, and uncover the history of Circadian City's odd, odd rivalries.\r\n</li><li><strong>Pick a side</strong>: break stuff with Team Sugar, or shake down kidnapping suspects with Team Spice. Laws will be broken either way!\r\n</li><li><strong>Tons of characters to find</strong>: Twelve locals to meet and bother and countless more to find in cameos, generously submitted by a range of Art Fight members.\r\n</li><li><strong>Like maybe two in-jokes:</strong> Are the other jokes any funny? Who knows! But zero knowledge of Art Fight is required to understand the game.\r\n</li><li><strong>Teen rating</strong>. Contains some crude jokes, slapstick violence, and swearing.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>-------------</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This game was not made by a member of Art Fight staff and should in no way be considered \"official\".
