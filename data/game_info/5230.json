The farmers, however, won&#39;t let their cows go without a fight. Players must tackle wrapping level layouts, hide and sneak in the cover of tall grass, and throw veggies, rocks, or anything else they can at farmers to bring the livestock back to their space ship.</p>", "metacritic": 53, "released": "2009-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T06:17:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/aa5/aa5ab93d2f14a3ac3820c634ab18f4da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Creat Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Creat Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
