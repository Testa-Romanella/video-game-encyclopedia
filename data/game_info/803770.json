It is not perfect but I enjoyed developing it with what I've learned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a simple game with a straightforward objective: Pickup the books with different genres\u00a0and place them on their correct bookshelf.</p>\n<p>I would love to hear your feedback on this. And if you find any bugs or have any suggestions to make the game better or more interesting, do let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>PS: I am not a professional game dev and doing all this programming as a hobby.\u00a0:)</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Pickup book: <strong>E</strong></li><li>Place book on a bookshelf: <strong>SPACE</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a4/1a4de42d6c25209f5f2346969ce78f97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ashutosh"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
