It's a homing projectile that will follow enemies.</p>\n<p>Lightning: It spawns a burst of\u00a0Lightning at a random position near the player, it gives much more damage, and applies the \"Electrified\" effect that reduces the enemy defense. It is available to unlock since the start of the game.</p>\n<p>Fire Ball: Shoots a fireball towards your target, it applies the \"burning\" effect, which gives damage over time. It will become available after 4 minutes of game play. It has a wide angle when more projectiles are available.</p>\n<p>Tornado: Spawns a tornado at the player's position and will circle around the player. It doesn't applies any effect, but it doesn't stop on the first enemy it hits.\u00a0It will become available after 6 minutes of game play.</p>\n<p>Ice Bolt: Shoots an ice bolt\u00a0towards your target, it applies the \"frozen\" effect, which slows down your target.\u00a0\u00a0It will become available after 8 minutes of game play. It has a narrow angle when more projectiles are available.</p>\n<p>Holy Nova: It spawns multiple projectiles in a circular shape around the player, the projectiles will do two \"laps\" before they vanish. It applies the \"blind\" effect, that reduces the damage of your target</p>\n<p>When leveling up the Hero you can choose to unlock new spells, upgrade your stats or spells. Upgrading the spells will allow\u00a0it to shoot more projectiles, raise it's damage or reduce it's\u00a0 delay.</p>\n<p><strong>The Necromancer has 6 summons, those are 4 skeletons and two spells.</strong></p>\n<p>Skeleton: The most basic summon, it costs 1 point of mana, has 1 hp, does 1 point of damage and has 3 of speed. Starts unlocked.</p>\n<p>Skeleton Rogue:\u00a0The second summon, it costs 2 points of\u00a0mana, has 5 hp,\u00a0does 1 point\u00a0of damage and has 4 of speed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bone Cleave:\u00a0The third summon, it costs 5 points of\u00a0mana, and it spawns a wall that does 1 point of damage if the player touches it.</p>\n<p>Skeleton Soldier:\u00a0The fourth summon, it costs 6 points of\u00a0mana, has 30 hp,\u00a0does 4 points of damage and has 4 of speed.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Bone Wall:\u00a0The fifth summon, it costs 10 points of\u00a0mana, and it spawns a wall that blocks the player movement.\r\n</p>\n<p>Skeleton Knight:\u00a0The last summon, it costs 15 points of\u00a0mana, has 60 hp,\u00a0does 6 points of damage and has 3 of speed.<br/></p>\n<p>The Necromancer will get a new summon every two levels of the player, it doesn't matter how much time has passed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p>\n<p>Playing as the Hero: Try to stay as far as possible from the enemies, they will spawn around you, but you're faster then they're. Try to get the movement speed upgrade to be extra sure you can escape, and don't discard improvements to health and defense if you want to last longer. The enemies will drop health potions.</p>\n<p>Playing as the Necromancer:The player has a protective aura that won't let you summon near him, so try to lure the player to pick up the experience dropped and then circle him with weaker enemies. Save a bit of mana for the right occasion to trap the Hero, and use the walls at your favor.</p>\n\n<p>Known Issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Restarting a game might cause stronger enemies to appear since the beginning.</li><li>Changing the game mode might cause the player to stop attacking.</li><li>On both cases reloading the game will fix the issue.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T14:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7d/a7d3397893fee43e566dfb69727f652e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beorgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
