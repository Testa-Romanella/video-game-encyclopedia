It can really make a difference.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n-  In case of power attacks, all active ships from the target team take  20% of the damage made to the main target. Power attack information  wasn\u2019t added, but it could be perceived if you are attacking more than 2  adversary ships. All attacks for your ships can be searched in Training  stations throughout the game, as the name implies, damage made in  battles are outside the normal scope and it will not affect your fleet  afterwards.\r\n-  Do not take heed on the \u201ctype\u201d field outside of ship information, it is  mostly wrong and does not provide any meaningful in-game applications  as it was intended.\r\n-  The 2 \u201cgo to x\u201d buttons below the map do not move you into those  locations, it will only show them on the map. To move you just need to  press a position on the map, but beware of the fuel costs. You can buy  fuel and increase tank space if needed.\r\n<p>That\u2019s pretty much it, the rest I think is very straight forward.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-21T02:02:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c52cd66a04ba7edb178f30d2776b10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["p_r"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
