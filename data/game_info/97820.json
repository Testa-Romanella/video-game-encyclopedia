Explore the map, shoot enemies, collect loot &amp; visit settlements to repair &amp; upgrade your hovercraft. Controls are simple; WASD to move &amp; Space to shoot. Gameplay is entirely open-ended at the moment, objectives etc. may come in future updates.</p><p> This game started as a college project, but I've added to it since &amp; have big plans for it. It's on hiatus at the moment while I try to juggle 4 other projects, but I'm putting it up on Itch to see if I can get any helpful feedback for when I do return to it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b6c63136912693da092a4a1911989f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["r00k"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
