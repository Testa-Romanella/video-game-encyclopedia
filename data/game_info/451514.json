The death toll was over\u00a0<strong>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 </strong>confirmed victims before the shark finally was put down by a brave \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, with unconfirmed disappearances in the thousands according to some estimates. The Bureau has not been able to verify any of the sources.</p>\n\r\nCause\r\n<p> The killer shark also exhibited psychic powers and situational awareness far greater than that of any known shark, potentially even rivalling project \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in combat utility. With natural mutations deemed highly unlikely as an explanation (probability \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, with estimated relative error 0.5%) it was theorized the shark was a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 military project. Since no further attacks by similar animals occurred, and the naval base near \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was evacuated and subsequently abandoned three days prior, it is possible that the shark was an escaped prototype, and the project cancelled due to the animal posing equal threat to its creators as its intended victims.</p>\n<p>Agents dispatched to the base ruins during operation \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were unable to recover any of the research or discern its purpose due to a combination of harsh weather and radiation levels, and at the time, it was concluded to have been part of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 nuclear program. The Bureau urges agents to treat both these theories as equally valid and possible until further evidence is obtained.<br/><br/></p>\r\nCollected Evidence\r\n<p>Abnormally high chemical traces of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, industrial-grade \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and the common narcotic \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 were found in the sea where the event occurred. While it is possible some of it were released through the blood of the shark's victims, the presence of industrial-grade chemicals outlawed in the U.S. suggest a connection to the shark, and supports the hypothesis that it was created by a foreign force. Despite the elite diver squad searching the area around the shark's last known location for \u2588 days, its body could never be recovered.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nSocietal Impact\r\n<p>The event had a large cultural impact, and while the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 resort was forced to close following the aftermath, shark tourism has become a major source of income for the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 population. 13 feature movies were shot by label producers during 1977-1980, though Bureau agents enforced cancellation of \u2588 projects due to too high factual accuracy.
