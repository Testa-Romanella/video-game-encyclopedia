Software Planning in 1993. Its storyline is not directly connected to the original Shining Force, although a Game Gear title Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict links the two games&#39; plots.<br />\nThe game is much longer than the first and more free-roaming. There is no chapter system, so the player can return to previously visited parts of the world. There are also two different ways of promoting many characters.<br />\nThis game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on October 3, 2008 and in North America on October 6, 2008. It also appears in Sonic&#39;s Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and as a standalone game on Steam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-14T22:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e0/9e01548ff71e9f156ca9f0139e6d510a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.42, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 21, "beaten": 25, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 9, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 376, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC", "Genesis", "Wii"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Camelot Software Planning", "Sonic!
