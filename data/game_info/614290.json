I got the idea of making this crap when i was pretty bored on school with my friends. (This game contains the tutorial texts on hebrew but for some reason they got deleted on this web build) Basically the first two levels are just the very basic mechanics of the game. Then you start to do some epic parkour like mirrors edge 2 or sum shit like dat. And at the end you came to visit guy jamba for the epic victory royale!!!</p><p>Best Game Ever 420/69</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T06:34:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10d/10da04205379acc94560199e27ea2aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ariel_S"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
