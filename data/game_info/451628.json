Well, the number puzzle game isn\u2019t entirely new, but we promise, you\u2019re gonna love it! Train your logic and maths skills, outdo yourself on every level! <br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>\u2022 Depending on the mode, the numbers are placed differently on the field. Your task is to clear the field by connecting identical numbers (like 1 and 1 or 4 and 4) or the ones that make 10 (like 8 and 2 or 7 and 3). <br/>\u2022 You can connect pairs of numbers located in the neighboring horizontal and vertical cells, the ones that have empty cells between pairs, or you can also check the end of one line and the beginning of the next. <br/> <br/>GAME MODES<br/>The game is simple and has 3 playing modes:<br/>\u2022 Static. This mode offers a set of levels with fixed number fields. There is no option to add more numbers, so you\u2019ll need your logic to connect the numbers.<br/>\u2022 Classic. In the Classic mode, the numbers appear in the field in an orderly succession. You can play endlessly, when you are out of moves, just tap Add.<br/>\u2022 Random. Looks pretty much like Classic, but the numbers you get appear without any particular order, at random. You can play endlessly in this mode as well.<br/><br/>Also, you can choose the JOURNEY and play for a fixed amount of time. It is not so easy-peasy as it may seem. Your goal is to score certain points or clear the field completely. You are free to add new numbers, but if you reach the top of the field, you lose.<br/><br/>KEY FEATURES<br/>\u2022 Enjoy Achievements and become a super puzzle-solver!<br/>\u2022 Know your Statistics to get better results in the game.<br/>\u2022 Don\u2019t despair if you got stuck \u2014 there are plenty of hints to manoeuvre better through the game.<br/><br/>Start with Static, try your hands at Classic and Random, or choose Journey if you want something a little bit trickier!
