We had a lot of fun ideating on mechanics, themes, and potential twists. This was an unusual project for us because it required very strong art direction, which made for an interesting challenge with the strict time limit of the Trijam. The code is pretty dirty looking, but it seems to work without any major crashes or bugs. In the final twenty minutes we managed to find, edit, and apply sound effects and background music which we feel really brings up the overall polish. We recognize that the tile flip animation is incomplete and needs more work, but given the other more pressing art requirements, making six additional keyframes of animation was sadly out of scope.</p><p>The plan is to develop this small prototype into a full featured game. this was originally built for Trijam 154, but due to the tight time constraints, we were only able to make one puzzle functional.</p><p>The first goal of future development will be to fix the missing keyframes in the tile flip animation. After that, we hope to implement additional levels and explore the core concept by adding additional patterns and alternative cursor behaviors.<br/></p><p>Time Spent:</p><ul><li>Andrew Bowers (Cmdr3nder) - 2h 55m</li><li>Anna Bowers (Dreamsprite) - 2h 54m</li></ul><p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Cloud Puppy Games:</p><ul><li>Andrew Bowers (Cmdr3nder) - ideation, programming, integration</li><li>Anna Bowers (Dreamsprite) - ideation, art, music sourcing and editing, typesetting, layout</li></ul><p>External Assets:</p><ul><li>Font -\u00a0Dogica by Roberto Mocci, OFL (SIL Open Font License)</li><li>Sound effects - Mixkit Game Show Sound Effects, Mixkit License</li><li>Soundtrack - Jazz Music by Stream of Melodies</li></ul><p>Tools:</p><ul><li>Godot (game engine)</li><li>Aseprite (pixel art studio)</li><li>Audacity 3.0 (audio editing)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:46:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/485548fc598e67079e1accc55cc29387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cmdr3nder", "dreamsprite"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
