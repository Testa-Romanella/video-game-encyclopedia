Starting with only a dream and an abandoned park the player will discover ground breaking technologies, new attractions and a special bond with each of their Dinos, all captured in stunningly beautiful modernized 3D flat design graphics.<br />\nIn Parkasaurus if you care for your dinos, discover new technologies then your park will thrive.<br />\nExhibit Design: Design success - each dinosaur requires a unique biosphere, which means the shape of exhibit, materials used, ecology, plants, elevation and humidity all play a key role in whether the Dinos, and the park, thrive...or become extinct.Park Creation and Management: Wisely spend resources to build the ultimate Dino Park and turn a profit to ensure future stability.Guest Monetization: By reading reviews and observing your guests, fine tune the flow and arrangement of your park to maximize the happiness of guests and Dinos alike.Employee Management: Level up rookie hires, or bring on established veterans, to help run your park smoothly and efficiently.Time Travel for Dinos Eggs: Go back in time to retrieve the hottest (and oldest) Dino Eggs.Chaotic Dino Escapes: Switch into first person view to handle any Dino rampages quickly and with care, before disaster strikes.Year Round Challenges: Manage unexpected weather catastrophes, as well as the expected diverse demands each season brings.<br />\nCurrently Parkasaurus is in an early stage of development although a lot has been done!
