Some examples of time powers are:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTime Manipulation: The ability to control time in general, such as creating time loops, altering the past or future, or changing the rate of time for oneself or others1.<br/>\r\nTime Travel: The ability to move across different points in time, either physically or mentally1.<br/>\r\nTime Stopping: The ability to halt the flow of time for a certain area or target, making everything appear frozen1.<br/>\r\nTime Vision: The ability to perceive past or future events, or alternate timelines1.<br/>\r\nTime Blast: The ability to unleash a powerful burst of temporal energy that can damage or affect the target\u2019s time1.<br/>\r\nThere are many more types of time powers, and some of them can be very creative or complex. For example, some video games feature time powers that can create a time shield, a freeze zone, a time dash, or a time bomb2. Time powers can also be combined with other abilities, such as spatial manipulation, dimensional travel, or reality warping1.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTime powers are often considered very powerful and dangerous, as they can alter the natural order of things and cause paradoxes or anomalies. Therefore, time powers usually have some limitations or drawbacks, such as requiring a lot of energy, concentration, or skill, or having negative side effects, such as aging, memory loss, or temporal instability1. Time powers may also be subject to certain rules or laws, such as causality, fate, or destiny1.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTime powers are a popular theme in fiction, especially in science fiction and fantasy genres. Some famous examples of characters with time powers are Doctor Strange, The Flash, Hiro Nakamura, Max Caulfield, and Tracer1. Time powers can also be used as plot devices, such as in Back to the Future, The Terminator, Steins;Gate, and Avengers: Endgame.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T14:23:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/842/842e7bd4d35e6aee527e518ebdaf5b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blain"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["blain"], "esrb_rating": null}
