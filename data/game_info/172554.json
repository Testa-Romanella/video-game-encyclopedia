You have a C-Cannon that shoots deflective shots, they will bounce around a while before dissolving and can hurt your ship. You also have Probiotic Torpedoes which will burst out a wave of probiotics onto the bacteria. Use with caution as every bacteria reacts to probiotics differently.

Their continued focus on not just the technology itself but the needs of the medical community have brought about an entirely new way to quickly and painlessly cure what was once believed to be long term illnesses. Utilizing their latest creation, the Gastrointestinal Tracker or GIT, they are able to remotely control a nanocraft as it passes through the human body, and literally attack the bad bacteria it finds along the way. Effectively curing before illness even happens, with the one-two punch of the Probiotic Torpedo and C-Cannon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/344/34416987cb291013042d0bf9466dc796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["korerat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
