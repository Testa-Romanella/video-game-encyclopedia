Each character gets two actions to use during their turn. With your actions, you can move, attack or pick up items. Though beware, for the enemies have their own actions to utilize during their turn and they will stop at nothing to cut you down. Choose your actions carefully; you'd be wise to think twice before you move.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/831563644b6ad7abc04f2c53160a25e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frappee"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
