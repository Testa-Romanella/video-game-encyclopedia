He's a polite dog, though, and doesn't want to bump into anyone. If you bump into any people, the game is over!<br/><br/>Run to pause your growth, bark to make people turn the other way, and eat hot dogs to shrink back down!<br/><br/>How many hot dogs you eat is also the score.<br/><br/>Outside of the game is a tale of two friends who grow up together, and then grow apart.<br/><br/>Arrow keys to move<br/>X to bark<br/>Z and an arrow key to run<br/><br/>Music by the legendary AIRVOSS.<br/></p><p>Dev notes:<br/>Made for Ludum Dare 34. The themes were Growth and Two Buttons. I'm pretty happy with this game, despite the core of it being very simple, as it explores themes I've wanted to tackle for a while (connections and friendships fostered through games). I can see myself exploring it more in future games.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c6bb42976bb0404b1ba6f3a1ab38d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
