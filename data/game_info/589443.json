{"id": 589443, "slug": "anomaly-lophee", "name": "Anomaly (Lophee)", "name_original": "Anomaly (Lophee)", "description": "Description\r\n<p>Not only did robots take over the world, they also found ways to mess with spacetime. To protect themselves from the human resistance, they created anomalies that occur every 10 seconds if a mortal is close to them, some as simple as healing the robots, others go as far as cloning all robots around.</p>\n<p>As the leader, and in fact last member\u00a0of the resistance, you equip yourself with your favorite weapons - a trusty old revolver, a deadly shotgun, your fallen comrads Assualt Rifle and a Sniper with deadly precision. Soon you find out that even your weapons are affected and switch during an anomaly!</p>\n<p>Determined to revenge as many of your old friends as possible and destroy even the last robot, you go as deep into the enemies territory as you can. Are you able to reach the end and demolish all robots?\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>Spoiler:\u00a0No. This game is endless.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anomaly was created for the\u00a0Bullet Hell Jam.\u00a0In the beginning, I had some help from\u00a0Gerald Montufar\u00a0but he had to quit early due to personal reasons. Music was provided by\u00a0Franck Poulhon\u00a0(Soundcloud).\r\n</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>I\u00a0would love to hear what you think! Either comment here or message me @LoFiGameDev or Discord (Lophee#4625)\u00a0if you want. Feedback is always welcome :)\r\n</p>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>In some cases, bullets just randomly disappear. Mostly affects enemy bullets. No idea why.</li><li>It's sometimes possible to dash or be pushed into the wall. Workaround:\u00a0Press 0 to be placed in the middle of the active room or 9 to toggle NoClip and walk back to where you were. Don't cheat, though! Or cheat. It's your playthrough, just have fun.</li><li>In very rare cases (seen only once)\u00a0the stairs to the next floor spawn outside of walkable rooms. No matter how often I\u00a0tried,\u00a0I\u00a0wasn't able to reproduce it, so I hope it won't happen to anybody playing.</li></ul>\n\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n<p>After 2 nack to back jams not long before this one, I initially planned to just take a break and focus on other things for a while - but here we are. A cool dude\u00a0from my uni asked me if I\u00a0wanted to jam with him, and because the jam site was so beautiful, I\u00a0just had to postpone my break. Unfortunately, he had to quit the jam a day after we started so I was left with an idea I really liked and a sound designer we teamed up with who was just as motivated as I was, so I\u00a0was torn. As you can see, I\u00a0decided to push through and even though the end result is much less polished than planned in the beginning, it's still something I'm happy with, especially since I\u00a0used many things I\u00a0never used before and learned a ton.</p>\n\r\nLegal stuff\r\n<p>All assets in this game are either free to use, already owned by me or made by myself.
