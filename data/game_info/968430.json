{"id": 968430, "slug": "cult-of-personality", "name": "Cult of Personality", "name_original": "Cult of Personality", "description": "Cult of Personality is social deception game for 5-8 players that bends the rules of what players can see, do, and hear... In life, and death! <br/><br/>Your cult's goals are to complete a forbidden ritual and summon your deity to bring about the end times! However, some of your would be cultist pals have been disillusioned from your cult's enchantment, and will do everything in their power - especially cold-blooded murder - to stop you!<br/><br/><strong>The Ritual</strong><br/>As a dutiful cultist you'll be tasked with group \"trials\" that must be completed by working together. Complete the trials (involving the occasional blood sacrifice), then finish the ritual in darkest depth of the castle <br/><br/><strong>Combat</strong><br/>A simple but effective directional combat system takes the place of voting and Insta-kill in Cult of Personality. Defectors must catch Cultists unaware for the kill, and if you're suspicious that one of your fellow cultists isn't devoted to the cause, take action and attack!<br/><br/><strong>Possession</strong><br/>The game doesn't end once you enter the great beyond! As a ghost, you can possess objects and NPCs around the map to help complete the ritual, or kill the remaining Cultists to stop it. As a Defector you can even possess living players; making them attack peers, or sabotage the ritual to cast doubt on their allegiance...<br/><br/><strong>Other Features</strong><br/><ul><li> light-based Visibility - In fire or torchlight, player color and names are visible, but stray into the darkness, and only silhouettes can be seen. Anonymity is a Defector's biggest strength, and keeping the mansion dark can be vital for their success. <br/></li><li> Room-based proximity voice/text chat - Information and debate are key to unmasking Defectors, but stray too far and your cries for help may go unanswered...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T05:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e0/1e0ae2138c4e7c1117731c6c111be2b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spiked Games"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Spiked Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
