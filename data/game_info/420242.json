The laser-types are colorcoded. The color scheme can be changed in the main menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, <strong>Tapping</strong> (or clicking) gets you very far. Also <strong>Holding a Tap</strong> changes the lasertype over time.</p>\n<p>If you don't want to\u00a0<strong>Tap / Click </strong>or don't want to destroy your mouse you may also just press/hold <strong>Space.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The goal of this game is\u00a0<em>not </em>to make something exceptionally good. The goal is to make <em>something</em> and to get that something to a point where it is somewhat finished.</p>\n<p>Currently I think the game is at a point where it is playable, there is some (programmer) art made by me, some effects, and gameplay which is at least little bit interesting.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you tried this game please leave some feedback.
