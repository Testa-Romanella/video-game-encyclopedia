You the player, working with a team of several others, plan to infiltrate the facility to gather intel and find a way to permanently destroy the source of all of their games. Yet you haven't realized that you yourself are currently inside of a bad MS Paint fangame. Unaware of what dangers await you and what great sacrifice you must make if you want to destroy these atrocious fangames, you descend into the darkness.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>It's a Clickteam Fusion FNaF fan game! If you are unable to run this game properly on your device, you should seriously consider upgrading your computer.\r\n</p>\n<p>ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: you need to install the fonts that come with the game. If you don't, then the text will not render correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Five Nights at Freddy's belongs to Scott Cawthon. This is merely a fangame using characters and locations from the FNaF series (SL and FFPS in particular) and is not associated with the story of the original games.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T12:24:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/082/082c6791897b7111008fc7f98b72d73a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frigid_Mouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
