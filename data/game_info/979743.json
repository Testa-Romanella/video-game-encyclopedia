Help Cartridge rescue someone unexpected. A journey awaits, can you make it?<br/><br/>Hi, I'm Bowser, a solo indie dev. I wanted to create something that exists somewhere between a game, a maker game, and a game engine, a toy box that can be enjoyed by casual players, skilled players, level designers, modders, rom hackers, and everyone in-between. Full game, not early access, no in-app purchases, no DLC, and I'm committed to regular updates, with at least a few new things for the editor each week. I'll also be releasing source code for sample mods.<br/><br/>To mod the game, extract Sdk.zip in the install directory and read GettingStarted.md. Most people can run their first mod within minutes.<br/><br/>Full controller support. Designed for cozy couch gaming. No mouse or keyboard needed.<br/><br/><h3>\ud83d\udc2f Features \ud83d\udc2f</h3><br/><ul><li>Run, jump, swim, fly, carry, throw, and roll around in a vibrant world full of secrets.<br/></li><li>Unique shake mechanic changes how you interact with your environment.<br/></li><li>Includes a story mode with 10 levels.<br/></li><li>Includes an in-game level editor.<br/></li><li>Built on a custom game engine designed from the ground up for modding.<br/></li><li>Includes an easy-to-use C# SDK, allowing anyone to create new objects.<br/></li><li>High framerate support, up to 240Hz.<br/></li><li>Achievements.
