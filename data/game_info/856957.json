Do you want to Simulate the\u00a0soul crushing effects of living under late stage capitalism exciting day to day life of a cashier? Well your in luck! In this incredibly\u00a0simplified accurate simulator of being a cashier, you can do such things as</p>\n<ul><li>Go to work!</li><li>Feed yourself</li><li>Pay Rent</li><li>starve to death in your own home</li><li>make money!!!!!</li></ul>\n<p>This simulator also features such things as:</p>\n<ul><li>buttons</li><li>text sometimes</li><li>cutting edge accurate to life minimum wages</li><li>sound (not implemented yet)</li><li>colors!?!?!?!?</li><li>disease and sickness</li></ul>\n<p>So apply today, to become a certified Warmrat\u2122 Cashier!</p>\n<p>(all rights reserved Warmrat corporation, Glory to Warmrat)</p>\n\n<p>this is still very early in the progress of being made. like, so early its not even really a game. funniest part is that half the \"features\" dont even work. THIS WILL BE FIXED!</p>\n<p>along with barely anything working correctly, theres absolutely nothing to do in the game. there will be more in the future probably, so stay tuned if the concept seems interesting.</p>\n\n<p>(also just a side note, i recommend using 1920x1080. there is the option for other resolutions, but i have not tested them at all and honestly, the game might be even more unplayable than it is now. Also, if you die, the main menu button does not work, so you WILL have to alt + f4 out of the game. so dont die.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T09:19:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8e36f5b09b70e31c3b1061efd7de450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ThatDude626"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
