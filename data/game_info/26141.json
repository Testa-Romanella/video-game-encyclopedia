Players compete \n      for top scores and prizes while visiting three different amusement \n      parks: Arcadia, Dreamland and Lagoon Park. Each park has four sets of \n      games and a Bonus Round that test the speed and accuracy of a player's \n      shooting skills. Whether a novice or a sharpshooter, the games are \n      continually challenging, and the difficulty level can be adjusted to \n      match the player's growing confidence.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
