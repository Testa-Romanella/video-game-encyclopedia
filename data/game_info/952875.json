I really enjoyed making this game and I am glad that I've finnaly posted something!</p>\n<p><strong>In this game you will find: </strong>TWO unique bosses, FOUR unique weapons, many obstacles and much more.</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY &amp; LORE:<br/></strong><strong>You're a pilot of flyus. You were kicked from a space plane because everyone thought you were an imposter (even tho you weren't). So you enjoy flying in the space without a way out. My recomendation is to avoid cometes, sattelites and ufos.<br/></strong>GOOD LUCK!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Player (flyus) follows your cursor only in the height and for moving forward you cant control him. Pray not to be killed by BigStar boss and his goffy ahh stars. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f<br/></p>\n<p>In menu navigate by the arrows (up and down), when switching option (in settings) I highly recomend using left and right arrows.</p>\n<p><strong>FAQ:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is shop?<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: You can buy the default weapon there!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q: What is this button?<br/></strong></p>\n<br/>A: It is a UFO.
