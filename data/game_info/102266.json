Last one standing wins. Features AI for playing with less than 3 hoomans.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis game was developed by Michael Louden as part of the Noisey 24 Hour Game Jam by Wrench Games. The theme was \"Three Man Duel\". All assets created within the allotted time, with a focus on sound. Controls are customizable in the Unity launch screen, but are initially set up for Playstation DS4 controllers. For 1-3 local players. Enjoy!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>UPDATE: 11/14/2016 - TriDuel entering Alpha v0.1!</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDue to the awesome support I have received from you itch.io people, I've decided to continue developing this game into a full featured product, starting with a significant update to the interface and customization.
