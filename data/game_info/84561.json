We loved the way it turned out, so when we sat down with the Apple TV and a couple of game controllers, we decided it\u2019d be a fun game to release.<br/><br/>It\u2019s intentionally a mini game, but it has 3 different game modes, including a 2 player vs mode, and features some funky music from nosoapradio.us.<br/><br/>Although it was intended for play with an MFi game controller accessory, there are two different control schemes for the remote too, so if you only have one controller you can still play the 2 player mode.<br/><br/>We had a lot of fun taking this little jam and putting it on the big screen in our living room, so we hope you\u2019ll give it a shot and maybe get a kick out of it too.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T03:56:28", "background_image": null, "website": "http://facebook.com/retrodreamer", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Retro Dreamer"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Retro Dreamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
