In each run a new cave is generated. At the starting point you will find a drone that follows the player and where you can buy upgrades and tools for mining. These speed up the mining of the ores and allow you to reach higher levels of the cave, where you can find rarer ores.</p>\n<p>This is my first game created with Unity DOTS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T22:20:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d813390d92458fbeb57764f8a5793f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLBGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
