This goal was almost reached: collapsing German Army was not capable to offer resistance, while local armies were not prepared for the war yet.<br/><br/>The next stage started when German Army managed to build defences in front of Germany's borders. New regular units and freikorps were sent to Latvia, help was offered to organize local armies. The Red Army was pushed away to the east.<br/><br/>The same Germans who just had driven bolshewiks away now started to act, lead by imperialist goals. Estonia and Latvia had to fight for their independence.

This army with its allies tried to wipe out Latvia.
