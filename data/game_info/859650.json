You are on a powerful ship, but its most powerful feature is its ability to upgrade its various capabilities using natural resources found throughout the universe. This allows you to upgrade your ship as you travel towards your destination, and is in fact quite necessary due to the vast distance you need to travel.</p>\n\n<p>Note: The Windows version is currently recommended, as I have not yet figured out a strange problem with fullscreen in the web version. (Also, if the web version isn't responding to keyboard input, the Windows version should still work).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T06:29:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/232fb5ff4e9ac6359842bfe793b596b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Honey Pony"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
