They're called Flip and Flop and they're here to gather all the gold they can.</p>\n<p>Control Flip and Flop in their frantic puzzle quest to gather all the gold. Swap places with your shadow twin to complete the puzzles and become rich.</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>The game is playable here in your web browser, or on your Windows desktop PC in TWO (yes, TWO) flavours - you can play the Global Game Jam entry (the original, without cute penguins and little Quality of Life\u00a0touches) or the version you see here.\u00a0There's also a modern build available of the post-jam version, that might be more compatible with modern PCs, but lacks the true retro feel.</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move the penguins, Space to swap places, R to restart the level, F4 to set fullscreen and ESC to quit.</p>\n<p>For the exit to open, you need to collect all the gold. Just don't get killed by skulls or the water!</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>A game by KitsuneFox / Extremely Awesome Games. Made for the Global Game Jam 2022 / PolyJam 2022, theme: <strong>DUALITY</strong>.\u00a0Fonts by Pjik and Gasara on DeviantArt.
