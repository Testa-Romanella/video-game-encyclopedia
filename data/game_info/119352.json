I had to cut out some features, the control system was really messy and there were a few bugs. So I decided to fix all (or at least most) of these problems with this version 2.</p><p>Here's the list of changes:</p><ul><li>modified the control scheme</li><li>added visible meters for 'fullness' and 'tiredness' stats. Now it will be easier to understand when your daughter needs food or when she is sleepy.</li><li>added a shop where you can buy head ornaments. The player earns money every day, so the more you play the more stuff you can buy.</li><li>a bunch of minor fixes and under-the-hood improvements</li></ul><p>The game is still far from perfect, and there are still a couple of features I wanted to add (like toys to buy, snacks and medicine to give her to restore her stats quickly, etc) but I think I've spent more than enough time on this project, and now it's time to move on to something else.</p><p>With that said, I hope you'll enjoy this version of the game. If you still run into bugs or other issues, do let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d2/1d2fcd097248592622063ebd83228bfb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
