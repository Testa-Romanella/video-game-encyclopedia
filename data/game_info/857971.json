The game is for ages 13+! (There is blood but it is unrealistic.)</p>\n<p>What is the game about? You work as a night watchman in a factory that produces prototypes for animatronics. The prototypes are hacked by an anonymous rival, they want to make you one of them. You should fix the error by writing and using an anti-virus program on a monitor (Has not been added). But you should also keep in mind that you cannot protect yourself from all robots and something can happen at any time.</p>\n<p>What does the player mainly do in the game? What are the basic game mechanics?</p>\n<p>You can watch the robots through the security cameras. You can hide from the robots in a closet to protect yourself in case one comes. It has two buttons that close mechanical doors to protect itself from incoming robots.</p>\n<p>What characters are in the game?</p>\n<p>The main character, i.e. the avatar, is a normal guy who has a job as a night watchman.</p>\n<p>The project was made with this IED:\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/</p>\n<p>The game got converted to HTML using:\u00a0https://packager.turbowarp.org/</p>\n<strong>game concept</strong>\n<p>The idea of my game comes from the horror genre and also Game Five Nights at Freddys (FNAF). This game Features Basic concepts of the game\u00a0Five Nights at Freddys, Art, Sound and some Gameplay features are self Made and Implemented.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You are forced to work as a night watchman in a factory by a mafia boss because you owe him money. However, the prototypes that are made in the factory are hacked by someone and start chasing you...</p>\r\nHorror \u2013 Psychological factor\r\n<p>\u201cJumpscares\u201d are popular effects in horror games. The word consists of \"jump\", the surprising jumping of an opponent, and \"scary\", the aim of scaring the player. This effect is used in the FNAF series and scares almost everyone. The player is also a little scared in the tutorial, since the perfect scare doesn't just come about with a loud sound and a creepy grimace, but is a process that is slowly built up so that the player almost pees his pants.</p>\n<p>Human psychology plays an important role in fear, since fear is a protective mechanism of evolution and should actually ensure our survival. In the gaming industry, such psychological tricks are used to give the player a mood. In the process, eyes, ears and even skin must be convinced that they should release adrenaline. Even your own imagination can scare you, as you imagine things before they even happen.</p>\n<p>Factors to scare the player:</p>\n<ol><li>Knocking on the window = panic is triggered because you don't know where or what it's coming from.</li><li>Alarm and loud sudden noises = fight and flight effect is triggered.</li><li>tarting the robot in the same room (white chicken) = stress and time pressure</li><li>Purple man is looking at you at the bottom of the screen. = Fear before one should be afraid because one knows that something is coming.</li><li>Distorted sounds (the animatronic tries to talk) = confusing and disgusting, because you tend to have an aversion to the abnormal.</li><li>When you are in the closet, the robot runs through. = One wants to survive. You think you are safe in the protection zone, but you are unshure.</li><li>Smiley appears on the screen. = you know you've lost.</li></ol>\n<p>You are\u00a0afraid of many things. Spiders, darkness, loud sounds, falling, clowns, puppets and much more. It doesn't matter whether it's rational fears, such as the fear of dying, or irrational fears, like the fear of oranges, every game designer should make their game scary in their own way and deal with the factors.</p>\r\nDeveloper Comentary\r\n<p>I made this game and documentation in Middle school, I was Around 14 to 13 Years old.
