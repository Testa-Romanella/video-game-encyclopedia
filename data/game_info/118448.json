Blow up mind control machines to save the galaxy.</p><p>Vacuous is a minimalistic action/puzzle game for Windows PC. Featuring an original soundtrack by ZABIE.<br/></p><p> Vacuous was my largest game development project in college, taking over two years to be completed. A tribute to what I had learned in my university physics courses and the spiritual successor to one of my first games, Vacuum and Force, Vacuous was my first attempt to create a game high quality enough for commercial release. With Vacuous I wanted to push my skills in level design, programming, and art. For the soundtrack I hired composer Joseph Elliot, whose score captured the spacey Genesis era vibe I wanted the game to have. Vacuous was created in Game Maker Studio.<br/></p><p>Official Vacuous Website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c42/c423583e4e1af64fe56c8f8acb4bfc7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JMStark"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
