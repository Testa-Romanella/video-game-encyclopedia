The aim of the game is to kill all the enemies that come after you. Your score goes up when you hit enemies. If at any time you need some health then just press the spacebar but you must have atleast $100 to do this and once you do it then you will lose those points and gain some health. To attack/shoot you click the left mouse button, you also aim with the mouse button. To move you use the WASD keys. Once you gain enough money then you can access the in-game shop using the TAB key. Here you can buy better weapons and armour. If you dont have enough money then you can just click the exit button to exit the shop. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e4/9e4adbc259b272d7b4a2a0fa153c6c40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joshting"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
