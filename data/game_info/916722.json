After each wave, you gain upgrade points, which you can use to upgrade your ship or repair the city. The goal of the game is to get as high a score as possible.</p>\n<p>This project is open source, and the code can be found at the following link: https://github.com/WillPunter/Vectropolis. It is software-rendered and is written from scratch in C, using only the Win32 API and the XAudio2 library for sound. You can use the code in any way you wish. Credit would be appreciated but is not needed.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T05:31:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfafa2587df71fc64e0132848d128aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WillPunter"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
