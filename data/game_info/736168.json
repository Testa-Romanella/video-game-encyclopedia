Dynamite Detective) in Japan, is an arcade beat &#39;em up video game released by Sega. It was the first beat &#39;em up to use texture-mapped 3D polygon graphics, and used a sophisticated move set by contemporary beat &#39;em up standards, often being likened to a fighting game in this respect. It also features quick time events, the ability to combine items to make more powerful weapons, and in two-player mode the ability to perform combined special moves and combos.</p>\n<p>The game was published in cooperation with Fox Interactive and was a licensed product based on the Die Hard movie franchise. Because Sega did not hold the Japanese video game rights for Die Hard, in Japan the game was stripped of the Die Hard license and published as an original property.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T17:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f6/3f689a921df1e60a39336c64b90b571d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "PlayStation 2", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["AM1"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
