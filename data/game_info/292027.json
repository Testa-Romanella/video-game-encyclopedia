I'm sure i had reason why i added this, i just can't remember why Ninja barrel can't touch wall.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Use arrow keys to move left-right.<br/>Use space to jump.<br/><br/>How does it fit the theme? <br/>At this point i don't think it does.  The whole idea was running interact with jumping. So you can't jump if your legs are in air, there also was blood, that should affect running, but its not implemented.<br/><br/>Why its so short?<br/>The scope of the game was fine. It was doable. Just i ended up having much less time than i planned, and simply runned out of time.<br/><br/>Musics and sound comes from Wowie gamejam resources.<br/>Everything else i made by myself.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c3/5c30bab321b3f10749b7a1bb53e8d8e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bart\u0142omiej Olender"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
