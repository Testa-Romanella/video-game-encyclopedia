{"id": 1562, "slug": "anomaly-2", "name": "Anomaly 2", "name_original": "Anomaly 2", "description": "<p>Anomaly 2 is a sequel to Anomaly: Warzone Earth and the third part in the Anomaly mobile game series. Anomaly series inverted the classic tower defense genre to create an innovative &quot;tower offense&quot; type of strategy.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the post-apocalyptic near future, sometime after the alien invasion of Earth that was described in Anomaly: Warzone Earth. By 2034, our planet is devastated and mostly covered with ice. The last remnants of humanity are trying to defeat the invading alien machines, who stay besieged in their highly fortified bases.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like its predecessors, Anomaly 2 puts the player in control of a convoy of armored vehicles. The goal of each mission is to fight your way through the enemy territory that is protected with defense towers and units. The game has no construction options or resource mining, but there are repair zones on each level. They allow the player to upgrade, purchase, or sell his or her units right in the middle of a mission. Anomaly 2 introduces a new gameplay option: morphing. All vehicles have more than one shape and can morph into different units with unique abilities.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>Anomaly 2 is the first game in the series to introduce multiplayer. This mode allows playing as either humans or alien machines. Humans gameplay is the same as in single mode. Playing for the alien side, however, completely changes the game and turns it into the tower defense where the player&#39;s goal is to withstand the siege.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2013-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-11T12:13:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1d0/1d01242356819c4cdd0f1a4baa46bd37.jpeg", "website": "http://www.anomaly2game.com/", "rating": 2.89, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 90, "owned": 1689, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 21}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 273, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 604, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 61, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Linux", "PC", "iOS", "Android", "macOS"], "developers": ["11 Bit Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["11 bit studios", "Chillingo"], "esrb_rating": null}
