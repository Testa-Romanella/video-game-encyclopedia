Just like many destinies and lives were thrown and broken in the fall of 1917 in Russia.<br/><br/>You climb up the crumbling stairs, and the only noise \u2014 the noise of your steps \u2014 echoes along the entrance, betraying your presence. Now you have a door in front of you, dimly lit by the timidly quivering fire of a match. But what is this door? Why are you here? Who are you anyway? Do you remember? No?<br/>You have only one way to find this out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>To enter the door and to pass all the logical chains using your quick wits; by learning bits and pieces to restore everything that was lost from your memory.<br/>And remember \u2014 there is always a choice! Even when it seems that everything is destroyed and there is no turning back. Even when it seems that nothing can be returned.<br/><br/>There is always a way to look inside yourself and do the right thing. Can you?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T12:43:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7e/e7eb2ee5f00c38496b79d76bf7f925e4.jpg", "website": "https://www.payara.games", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Payara Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Payara Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
