At least that what i got so far. This is a VERY VERY EARLY DEMO and all kinds of criticism are welcome. I do encourage people to find bugs and make suggestions about the story or maybe even how the final game will work. I should also tell you that EVERYTHING in this game is subject to change. Character, story, etc, etc. The plan for how this game is going to go:\u00a0 it will be a platformer game when you go room to room completing various courses along the way. The lab is basically a labyrinth(get it?) and you will have to achieve the various endings by getting to the end of the lab in different ways. Yes, when final game is out I will eventually spoil the endings and how to get them if someone didn't already.</p>\n<p>The bugs i am aware of as of now(I will update this section whenever I or someone else discovers a bug):</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jumping while directly next to a cube will make the camera spaz out a little bit</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The glitchy ass lighting system</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:11:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c8/1c873df1be0e750ecbdcd84ca4fef0c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LLGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
