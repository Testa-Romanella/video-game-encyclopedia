Well, the delivery is a complex process, it\u00a0requires many pieces of a system to work seamlessly and of course\u00a0perfection can never be achieved, because of a disaster, or a blackout, or a system crash, or some self-important\u00a0smartarse thinking they're so important and cannot be replaced... Which is pretty naive because they can. Even by robots.</em></p>\n<p>You control a loader robot. The task is simple: they ask you for a specific crate, you take it to them. Every crate is labeled, so you shouldn't be confused, but keep in mind that color matters too. Robot controls are pretty sensitive, may require some time to get used to. Use arrows to move a robot\u00a0and pick crates, Z then arrow to put a crate in a chosen direction. You can stack crates into towers of 3. Crates will come fast, so try not to\u00a0get stuck under the \"avalanche\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e71740cda4c08d76d8f41163ba3b379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yngwarr"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
