These pieces may only initially move and capture diagonally forwards. Only when a piece is \"crowned\" or \"kinged\" may it move both backwards or forwards. The opponent's pieces are captured by jumping over them. A player wins by capturing all of the opposing player's pieces, or by leaving the opposing player with no legal moves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba8300b8fa8400a50cab9b942ce0ea1_yMuReSi.jpg", "website": "http://www.ensenasoft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["EnsenaSoft"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["ENSENA SOFT SA DE CV"], "esrb_rating": null}
