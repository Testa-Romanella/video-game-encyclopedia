Battle Sweeper lets you relive the nostalgia of the classic single-player puzzle game with the added excitement of fighting to win. Includes multiple characters, monster battles, healing, achievements, and much more.<br/><br/>Instead of hitting that \"Game Over\" screen when you choose the wrong square, you'll begin a battle for your life! Defeat the monster for the chance to continue onward. Each time you complete a level, the next more difficult challenge awaits. All modes are endless and achievements await those with the skill to make it through a certain number of levels with each character.<br/><br/>Battle Sweeper is still Minesweeper at its core, but one mistake doesn't end the game. The turn-based monster battles are simple and fast, allowing you to quickly get back to clearing the level. During the battles you can attack or heal with potions, while defeat means the character will start back at level 1.<br/><br/>Each level you beat adds a monster to the next level and provides one bonus for your character - HP, attack, or a potion.<h3>Flexibility</h3><ul><li>For those who prefer playing with gamepads, this game has full controller support.<br/></li><li>UI Scaling for high resolution displays.<br/></li><li>Mouse enabled buttons for touchscreen support and remote play.<br/></li><li>Play in windowed or full screen mode.</li></ul><h3>Different Characters</h3>Choose from four different characters that determine the difficulty of the game:<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Knight<br/></li><li>Rogue<br/></li><li>Lizard<br/></li><li>Wizard</li></ul><h3>Bonus</h3>Classic mode is also available where there are no battles and hitting one monster ends the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd7/bd7710ef1ec4b6abcde33b08a9812a6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlpaSun Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AlpaSun Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
