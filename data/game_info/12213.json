Choice is always yours.The detailsKing of Booze is a drinking game that has no props, it's for two players minimum. It's played on a board similar to monopoly, where you move your character by using dice. Challenges are displayed based on the fields you land on.<br/><br/>Since we know drinking games require more challenges than we can think of we've created an option which allows YOU to edit and create your own custom cards where you create challenges but also the \"price\" in shots for them.<br/><br/>King of Booze also has HALL OF FAME that will keep track of your records in areas such as drinks number, challenges, BAC and laps.<br/><br/>Since drinking can be dangerous we also implemented an alcotest. Once you set it up our system keeps track of your BAC making sure you're informed about your state and warned in case you \"overdo it\". Because a drinking game should not only be fun, but make sure you're safe.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to actually read the description. Stay awesome ;)<br/><br/>Please drink responsibly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/181c161745c22c0f0766d70c596f0847.jpg", "website": "http://day-games.com/games/king-of-booze-drinking-game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 31, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Boris Mikic", "Daygames"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Boris Mikic", "Daygames"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
