One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.</p>\n\n\r\nInitial Pattern", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:00:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/750/7508018dc3e5bf4d5382188ba983ba8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["TrKo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
