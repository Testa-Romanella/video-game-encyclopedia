This is a Minecraft: Story Mode fangame where you play as Jesse (again) and go on an adventure (again). You're joined by familiar characters like:</p>\n<ul><li>Lukas (who writes a lot)</li><li>Petra (who's good at fighting)</li><li>Olivia (who's good at redstone)</li><li>Axel (who's good at blowing stuff up)</li><li>Romeo (who used to be the creator of the world or whatever)</li><li>Xara (who also used to be the creator of the world)</li></ul>\n<p>Try to survive and win the game as you enter a fortress that is pretty much not a place you want to visit for spring break and explore exciting features including:</p>\n<ul><li>A really gorgeous GUI that we unfortunately didn't make.</li><li>Nonexistent RPG battle mechanics.</li><li>Choices. (Everyone likes choices.)</li><li>Banter. (Banter makes everything better.)</li><li>No dating. (This is not an otome.)</li></ul>\n<p>Follow Jesse on a (very fun) adventure where you try not to get crushed, avoid zombies, and can banter with people.</p>\n<p><em>(But there's some strange cycle you seem to be stuck in... why does Jesse keep dying?)</em></p>\n<p>-----------------------</p>\n<p><strong>ANOTHER ADVENTURE</strong> is a short<strong> fan Minecraft: Story Mode\u00a0visual novel</strong> created in 4 days for Extra Credits Game Jam #3 where you try not to die and just run around a lot.
