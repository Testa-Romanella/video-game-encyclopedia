Now you're back. You're staying at your mom's friend's house, under the same roof with her and her two daughters, whom you knew since childhood. A lot has changed, and you have changed too.<br/></p>\n<p>So what do we have? <br/></p>\n<p>Hot summer, a city where no one knows you, and many beautiful women around. You can be whoever you want and do whatever you want, but we both know what you want to do this summer, right?</p>\n<p>You can find more info about the game at my <strong>Patreon page</strong>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game status and future plans</strong></p>\n<p>Sultry Summer Stories v.0.1 is here!</p>\n<p>This first public build introduces you to the main characters and shows most of the locations I have planned at the moment. For each character there is also a corresponding collectible card hidden somewhere in the city.</p>\n<p>So what's next?</p>\n<p>First, more content. More scenes\u00a0(regular and lewd) with each character that has been introduced, more characters, more quests, more collectible cards, more places and locations to explore.<br/></p>\n<p>Second, the density and quality of content. I want the world of the game to feel like a sandbox. The more interactivity and opportunities available to the player, the better. This is what I plan to focus on in the development process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will it stay free?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you can download and play for free, and I want it to stay that way. That is why I rely on the support of my Patrons to keep things running. \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Check my Patreon for more info about different tiers' rewards and stuff.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4b42ef042a33cb3bd946b2ad23a641.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acid Silver"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
