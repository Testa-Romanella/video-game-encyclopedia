{"id": 58034, "slug": "crazy-kong", "name": "Crazy Kong", "name_original": "Crazy Kong", "description": "For the album by Wild Willy Barrett, released the same year, see Krazy Kong.\n<p>Crazy Kong (\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30b0, Kureij\u012b Kongu) is an arcade game created by Falcon, released in 1981 and is similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong. Although commonly believed to be a bootleg version, the game was officially licensed for operation in Japan when Nintendo couldn't keep up with demand at home (even though Donkey Kong was still released in Japan), and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. Crazy Kong is also known as Congorilla, Crazy Kong Part II, Donkey King, and Monkey Donkey.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the original: Crazy Kong and Crazy Kong Part II. The differences between them are in minor cinematic artifacts and bugs, color palette choices and minor gameplay differences. Crazy Kong Part I shows no copyright or company name on the title screen. Crazy Kong (parts I and II) runs on modified Crazy Climber hardware. In addition there are other versions of the game that run on Scramble, Jeutel, Orca, and Alca hardware. The official versions of game came in two different stand up cabinets that featured a large and angry, rather than comic, ape embedded in the artwork. The cabinets were created by Zaccaria.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1981-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c1376f549011fd60fd20a3f8b21a4c8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Falcon"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Falcon/Zaccaria"], "esrb_rating": null}
