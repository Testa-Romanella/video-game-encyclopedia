But Akui High seems like it may not offer this opportunity for new beginnings and friendships. Something seems off about the people at this school; there seems to be a madness spreading from student to student as their discontent for each other grows. People you love and strangers alike all seem to be acting in unison to disrupt what was supposed to be a landmark time in their lives to make it a battleground of chaos and fear. Will you be able to escape this school with your sanity intact and not give into your darkest, most brutal ill will?</p>\n\n<p>*Multiple Endings*</p>\n<p>*Over 19,000 Words*</p>\n<p>*Horror and Mystery*</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Director:\u00a0</strong>Lancer</p>\n<p><strong>Writers:\u00a0</strong>Thaynose, Fyrebreak, Lancer<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Editors:\u00a0</strong>Fyrebreak, Alan<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Sprite Artist</strong>: angel [Twitch] [Twitter]<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CG Artist:\u00a0</strong>GoingGoingKeith<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BG Artist:\u00a0</strong>Fettuccine</p>\n<p><strong>GUI Artist:\u00a0</strong>kamkam<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong>\u00a0<strong>and Icon Artist:\u00a0</strong>lavenderGooms<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Musicians:\u00a0 </strong>J.A.X.
