Then you have one little mid-air collision, and you never hear the end of it.\" - Air Traffic Controller, New York TRACON<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to be an air traffic controller at a busy international airport?<br/><br/>As an air traffic controller it is your job to keep aircraft from colliding, while avoiding unnecessary delays. You are paid the big bucks for your visualization skills and guts. Just like the real job of an air traffic controller, you must pay attention and keep your eyes moving. There is always something that you could be doing! You must give takeoff clearances, landing clearances and taxi clearances in a strategic effort to maintain safety and efficiency where there would otherwise be total chaos. This is not a spectator's sport! After successful completion of all 14 levels of this simulation you will become an expert at visualization and managing priorities.<br/><br/>This simulation contains 7 different challenging airport layouts. You will be required to work at night, and occasionally in poor weather conditions. Knowledge of air traffic control is not required to be a top-notch air traffic controller in Airport Madness Mobile, but you do require nerves of steel.<br/><br/>Be sure to check out Airport Madness Challenge and Will It Fly!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/491/4916f50afe819c1b940ccdf35a4bb071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fluik"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Fluik Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
