Based on the successful real-life roleplaying game, players were able to explore the Twisted\u00a0Woods, Clan Courtyard and Portal Well realms and had to solve various puzzles and collect valuable items... and ultimately fight a huge stone golem!</p>\n<p>Since 2012, this original game is no longer available as Cyan Worlds shut down the servers. \"Forgotten Realms\" is a partial offline reconstruction in the Unity engine of that original online game.</p><p>In this reconstruction i am using 99% original assets made by Cyan Worlds. No copyright infringement is intended and it is made clear that Cyan and Creative\u00a0Kingdoms\u00a0LLC own all rights to MagiQuest and MagiQuest\u00a0Online.</p>\n<p>Right now it does not feature any quests or puzzles the original had, but those might be added in a future update. It is more of a walking simulator with limited interactivity which i hope gives you a feeling for what MQO looked like back in the day.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/7075fc5a62546485052e646b3529ce7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 479, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Veo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
