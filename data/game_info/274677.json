I always end up doing this. I get excited about an idea and try to make a full game in 48h. I should've focused on the one mechanic of sacrifing vital aspects of the game and make something simpler.</p>\n<p>### Problems:<br/>I didn't have much time for polishing at all, here are my major concerns:<br/>* No audio! SFX is just sitting in a folder in the project, but I had no time to implement it. Didn't have time for music.<br/>* No particle effects! I had a bunch of ideas for particle effects, especially for the rocket boosters and coming out from the edges of the game screen.<br/>* The tutorial is really bad and confusing. Originally I wanted a walkthrough where I take you through all the UI of the game, but there was no time for this :(. Sorry!<br/>* Bad balancing (too high chance for HP drops, enemies are too easy, some things are not worth sacrificing at all, etc). I literally added 6 waves the last 2 minutes.<br/>* Graphics are mediocre at best and there are no scene transitions. Lots of other graphical inconsistencies I wanted to fix as well, for example the warped screen borders in the main menu and the game over menu.</p>\n<p>### Other info<br/>* I spent around 20 hours into making this game (streamed on https://www.twitch.tv/lemorrow/).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/802/8026134abffdfa3bd4a0276b4f1055e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Marcus Otterstr\u00f6m"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
