You can place components and wire them up. Then apply signals from switches, push button, or clock.</p>\n<p>You can try to create circuits to match Truth Tables and run tests to check if they work properly. This is the idea for advancement in a later version that will be a game.</p>\n<p>You can also try to create simple computer circuits and program the ROM memory with micro-instructions and even your own OP codes. This is great for computer science students or hobbyists. You may also save and load memory data from disk.<br/></p>\n<p>If you could donate some payment, that would be great and encourage me to develop this further into something great.</p>\n<p>At this stage you can consider yourself a beta-tester and please report any bugs or improvement ideas to the issue log here: Issue Log</p>\n<p>I look forward to your enjoyment of trying this out and myself producing major updates in the near future.</p>\n<p>Cheers, Andrew Wilkes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T06:55:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e613a96d02770eedde011f7b324096a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andrew Wilkes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
