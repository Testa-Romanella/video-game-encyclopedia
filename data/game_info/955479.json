The game can be paused with control (tab in VICE) and aborted by pressing the back arrow key (or the ` key in emulators).\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Your task is to guide your snake <em>safely</em> along a road across a Canyon. You can only move the snake <strong><em>up</em></strong> or <strong><em>down</em></strong>. While travelling along the long straight road, admiring the scenery. During your very long journey, you will encounter scrumptious <strong><em>fruit</em></strong> that has been dropped on the road. However, there is also bad news. <strong><em>Bombs</em></strong> are also dropped on the road.\u00a0<br/><br/>At the top of the screen, you will see a <em><strong>green snake</strong></em>. Each part of the snake in the status panel will turn from <strong><em>green</em></strong> to <strong><em>gold</em></strong>. This indicates <em>how far you have travelled</em>. After the tongue of the snake is yellow and you travel a little further distance. You will move onto the <strong><em>next level</em></strong>, where <strong><em>more</em></strong> fruit and bombs will appear on the road, giving your snake less space to dodge those deadly bombs.<br/></p>\n<p>Can your snake reach safely to the other side of the canyon, or there be an explosive end for your snake?
