Tap on the playfield to launch your anti-missiles to destroy incoming missiles before they reach your planet. <br/>But there is a catch: enemy missiles can't be hit directly, but must be caught in the explosion of an anti-missile. Anticipate the path of a missile and launch your anti-missiles accordingly.</p>\n<p>But there is more...</p>\n<p>Enemy missiles come in three different shapes. Choose the launchpad with the same shape, then launch your anti-missile. Anti-missiles with different shapes than the missile have no effect.</p>\n<p>But there is still more.</p>\n<p>If a missile hits your planet, your shield is reduced. Destroy two missiles at the same time for bonus points and a shield bonus. Tap on the shield bonus to recharge your shield or gain a bonus if your shield is full.</p>\n<p>And that is all?</p>\n<p>No. After a while a boss will appear. Hit the boss with anti-missiles of the same shape as himself. You don't get any shield bonus as long as the boss is around, so get rid of it.</p>\n<p>And this goes on forever?</p>\n<p>No. You have to survive 10 levels to win the game. Try to score as much points as possible for personal satisfaction. <br/>Then try again to beat your highscore.</p>\n<p>\u2022 No ads<br/>\u2022 No in in-app-purchases<br/>\u2022 needs very few rights on your device<br/>\u2022 low hardware requirements<br/>\u2022 easy to master, fun to play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b682494159a6ec7bb6c91b21c81075bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["tkramer-gamer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
