(You'll see)<br/>after each wave you progress through, the difficulty will increase through much more frequent spawn rates of the paper clips. There<br/>is no consequence to missing the clips other than a decreased \"OVERALL RATING\" after a wave on the results screen.</p>\n<p>The controls are shown in the game tutorial screen but here's a reference:</p>\n<p>W/Arrow Key UP - To go up</p>\n<p>A/Arrow Key LEFT - To go left</p>\n<p>S/Arrow Key DOWN - To go Down</p>\n<p>D/Arrow Key RIGHT -\u00a0 To go Right</p>\n<p>Yours Sincerely,<br/>CowCat</p>\n\n<p>PS.
