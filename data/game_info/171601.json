Now that you've settled in, I\u00a0thought I'd explain what you'll be working on for your 3 weeks with us. Our technical lead has been building a new game prototype, and we'll need your help with what he called \"realtime manual optimisation\". Attached on this page are the project files for download - apparently he has left documentation within, but he gave this message to pass on:</p>\n<p><em><strong>\"WASD or arrow keys to move in the right view. Mouse to clean up in the left view.\"</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>I don't know what the means but I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out :)</p>\n<p>So you can get cracking on that for now - give me a shout later and I'll show you where you can find some lunch. I hope you enjoy your time with us!</p>\n<p>- Anna from HR</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a235f712d6baf90f0b9bbe7f0d4c3628.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["1y1e"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
