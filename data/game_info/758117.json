Infected ants will passively infect ants within their cloud of spores. If one ant is selected, the player can choose to \"Sacrifice\" that bug by pressing X. When this happens, the infected bug will die, and its remaining hp will be converted to spores that deal a potentially large amount of infection to nearby enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ants will attack nearby enemies.
