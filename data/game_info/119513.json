Using his trusty <strong>Multi-Splatter Paint gun</strong>, or <strong>MS Paint</strong> for short, <strong>Terribly-Drawn-Guy-With-Beard-And-Horns</strong> must travel into <strong>the</strong> rural sprawl looking for new houses to be painted for the <strong>DED</strong>. Defend yourself from the <strong>Big Oversized Super Something</strong>, who will try to catch you in his <strong>Cyan Beam of Squiggly Jitteriness</strong>, which will cause you to lose heart in your endeavor, somehow. </p><p><em>Also, you shouldn't touch the houses. They also cause you to lose heart in your endeavor. You know, because they might be orphanages you're marking to destroy. I couldn't tell if it was a house or a buck-toothed alien, and the consensus seems to be it's a building, so I'll go with that.</em></p><p><strong>Master the controls</strong>, either by using the traditional <strong>WASD</strong> for movement, or the <strong>optional arrow keys</strong>, if you swing that way. You can fire the <strong>MS Paint gun</strong> with the spacebar, or you can employ a <strong>secret technique</strong> that will <strong>double your firepower</strong>. <em>Can you unlock the MS Paint's full power</em>?</p><p>Watch out for our <strong>Kickstarter</strong> campaign, as we plan to add features as we meet milestones! At <strong>$20</strong>, the game resolution will be bumped up to <strong>720P</strong> and we'll be able to hire <strong>/u/Crapautard</strong> to provide us with new  <strong>HD graphics</strong>! At <strong>$40</strong>, we'll add <strong>boss bar and death animations</strong>! At $60, we'll be able to buy a cheap <strong>dollar store toy piano</strong> and provide both <strong>sounds</strong> and <strong>music</strong> to the game! (<em>and pay the internet bill with the rest.</em>) At <strong>$100</strong>, we'll go buy <strong>pizza</strong> and <strong>beer</strong> and be able to add \"<strong>successful game developer</strong>\" to our resumes! And also, a second playable character or something. </p><p>\"<strong>This game has serious potential.</strong>\" - /u/sanyc, Reddit.</p><p>\"<strong>I R8 8/8</strong>\" - /u/Advorange, Reddit.</p><p>\"<strong>Easily the game of the generation 11/10</strong>\" - /u/Washuchan73</p><p>\"<strong>Wow, this game is amazing. 11/10</strong>\" - /u/GoldenRedditUser</p><p>\"<strong>10/10. 100/100.

And in a way, it is. Redditor GoldenRedditUser (Which is a good thing he's a redditor, I guess, or else that name would have been a terrible choice) posted a satire GIF of Early Access-type games, which hit the top of r/gaming. Supposedly it's a repost, but whatever, I haven't seen it. If OP would like to get in touch either to get credit, lay claim to the billions of dollars I expect this game to net, or hit me with a DMCA notice for ripping off his graphic assets, send me a line. </p><p>I had a couple of hours and Construct 2 just sitting in my Steam library begging to be used like a desperate 20-something with daddy issues. So, instead of constructively joining into a Game Jam event and making something that I could actually be proud of, I made this pile of poo.</p><p><strong>Enjoy, don't enjoy, upvote, downvote, flame, complain, and carry on.</strong></p><p><strong>Update: 8/22/15, the Polished Turd Update</strong><br/>- Fixed bug with positioning of the secret weapon.<br/>- Fixed a related bug with alignment of DED.<br/>- Added a thing.<br/>- Selection boxes now appear for items pasted in.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thebitingcat"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
