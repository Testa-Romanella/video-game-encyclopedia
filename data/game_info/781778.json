If you liked the game, consider recommending it, or maybe give a tip. It would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Please play in full screen, without it, it looks kinda weird, and not complete, so you can see the tutorial, and have a bigger range of view. Top 10 players will be shown in the leaderboard. I didn't have time for screenshots, but game is cool. I guess :D : Game will take like 15 seconds to start after you click the button \"Start\", asteroids take a time to get there.<br/></p><p>Magnetic Mechanic: Magnets make Asteroid go towards them, so it doesn't kill earth.<br/></p>\n<p>Controlls:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A &amp; D : Move left and right.</p>\n<p>Space Bar : Jump</p>\n<p>Just for you to know, the leaderboard is kinda buggy, so you'll need to get out of the game, enter again and then if you got enough points to get in the leaderboard, you should be there.</p>\n\n<p>Music in game: https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/411991/</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/8-bit-style-sound-effects-6...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:06:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f6452185c42340fbb0cdb271f846fddc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alxo_Seal"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
