{"id": 434549, "slug": "forever-green", "name": "Forever green", "name_original": "Forever green", "description": "<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p>Use the Plant seeds button to start planting seeds. The seeds will become beans aftera certain amount of time. You can speed this time up by applying fertilizers to the seeds.</p>\n<p>Once they become beans they can be eating by insects and you also need to water them frequently. Deploy pesticide to make the insects stay away from the crops.</p>\n<p>You loose the game if all your crops die, or get eaten.</p>\n<p>Controls: You control the entire game with the buttons at the bottom. The tractor will follow a set path, so it will be easier for you to keep the early seeds in the path alive.</p>\n<p>HINTS: I\u2019m not sure the fertilizer is worth it right now, the growth time may be a bit to short.</p>\n<p>CURRENT ISSUES:</p>\n<p>Tee WebGL builds seems to have some issues with audio, I currently have about halft the sound effects, and another person reported they had none. The game is also a bit to easy I think.</p>\n<p>WebGL Link:\u00a0http://games.gildargaming.net/ld46/index.html</p>\n<p>Source code:\u00a0https://github.com/Gildar76/LD46/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f51f8e92c0f3cbffd6a8dbdb06300d7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GildarGaming"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
