However, due to stigmatization, homosexuals were thought to be the sum of these things. Adam Lambert's lyric \"They've branded us enough\" from Outlaws Of Love also speaks to this negative \"branding\" of homosexuals.</p>\n<p>According to a version of word2vec, homosexual as a word is similar to immoral, while immoral as a word is similar to despicable, irresponsible, shameful, disgusting, unacceptable, illegal, outrageous, stupid, obscene, and vile. This is an unfortunate situation mirrored in our language, but which is our recent history and arguably a part of the present indeed.</p>\n<p>Even though homosexual is stigmatized, many people decided to be true to what they love despite these depressing burden and made the world a more wonderful place by excelling in all professions.</p>\r\nThis game uses these sounds from freesound:\r\n<ul>\n<li>S: Short Glitch by unfa | License: Creative Commons 0</li>\n<li>S: Strange Synth Squelch by primeval_polypod | License: Attribution</li>\n<li>S: Retro_Laser_Shot_04.wav by MATRIXXX_ | License: Attribution</li>\n<li>S: Key.wav by MATRIXXX_ | License: Attribution</li>\n<li>S: bang01.wav by MicrosoftSam | License: Attribution</li>\n<li>S: Poof of Smoke by Planman | License: Creative Commons 0</li>\n<li>S: 8-Bit Powerup by SomeGuy22 | License: Creative Commons 0</li>\n<li>S: jewharp 40.aif by beskhu | License: Creative Commons 0</li>\n<li>S: CLOP_3.wav by moo_lfz | License: Attribution</li>\n</ul>\r\nSome Final Words\r\n<p>This game can take 40 extremely busy minutes to beat.
