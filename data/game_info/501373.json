As a big fan of the movie \u201c<strong><em>The Thing</em></strong>\u201d (1982) I always enjoyed the computer analysis perfomed by Blair (one of the <em>Outpost #31</em> crew members).<br/></p>\n<p>I decided to recreate that analysis on a modern computer. I tried to be as close to what can be seen in the original footage as I could. Thanks to that you can now feel a bit like Blair seeing how the alien cell is taking over terrestial cells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first my intention was to create only a simplified simulation -\u00a0a simple program (one screen) that would immediately display a few interacting cells. It could function as a screensaver. While developing I was coming up with many more ideas and eventually this program \"assimilated\" all of them. Finally it grew to a fully working simulation with menu system, statistics, music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>There are two major differences to what can be seen in the movie:</p>\n<p>1. When I was analysing the movie scene I figured there are two different infection methods. I called them phase1 and phase2.\u00a0 In phase1, an intruder infects a healthy cell. In phase2, an immitation infects another healthy cell. This infection involes a little thing that I started to call an infecting tentacle. I decided to use this effect for both phases, while in the movie this tentacle is only in phase2. I think it's more realistic to have this tentacle in both phases, and I don't know why it wasn't applied in the movie.</p>\n<p>2. I introduced the identification description \"CELL IMMITATION\". There's no such a description in the film. I decided to implement it, because my program is a full simulation and not an animation. After the first infection, the immitation can roam around for quite a while, so to distinguish it from other cells I decided to include this custom description.</p>\n<p>The current version is <strong>0.9</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This application is ready for use and all the features I wanted to have are implemented, but it's\u00a0in Beta stage, so there will be some updates coming.</p>\n<p>Follow me on:</p>\n<p>Facebook</p>\n<p>Tweeter</p>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Detail credits are included in the application under CREDITS menu.
