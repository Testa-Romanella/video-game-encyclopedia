Tessellation &amp; Geometry Shaders<br/> Lumped together because Geometry Shader only creates Normal, Bi-Normal, Tangent matrix</p>\n<p> 2. Normal, Specular, Opacity Mapping<br/> Both characters have normal and specular maps. Tress trunks and ground have Normal maps. Tree leaves have normal and opacity maps</p>\n<p> 3. Defered Alpha Transparency<br/> Transparent objects rendered in separate pass so both transparent and opaque objects can be lit</p>\n<p> 4. Full Deffered Render<br/> Lighting is calculated on the third pass while combining the transparent and opaque objects<br/> <br/> 5. Text Rendering<br/> Separate shader program to render text to the screen as a \"Forth Pass\"\u00a0</p>\n<p> 6. Multithreaded Animation and Animation Blending<br/> Although not taken full advantage of in this demo animation is multithreaded and there is blending between animations\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/> Hide and Seek!<br/> Go to the statue in the middle of the area and interact [E] your character will count.\u00a0<br/> The other character will \"hide\" randomly in the play area and you have to go find them.<br/> Interact [E] with them and they will respond!<br/> Rinse and Repeat!</p>\n<p> (Other controls displayed in bottom left corner of the game screen)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:49:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/068/068def8aa180bc3e63a0d609a20a0d1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["s_richardson_fanshawe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
