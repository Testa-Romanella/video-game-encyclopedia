{"id": 183806, "slug": "comfort-owl", "name": "Comfort Owl", "name_original": "Comfort Owl", "description": "<p>Made for Ludum Dare 34, with Twine.  You have a Caring Owl Plant, and choose how to take care of it daily.</p>\n<p>This was inspired by the game <em>Crazy Plant Shop</em>, in which certain plants have the faces of animals (cacti have cat faces, bunions have bunny faces, etc.), and the fact that people need to hear that someone cares.  Plus, I really like owls.  I hope you do, too!</p>\n<p>I incorporated the \"growing\" theme with the growing of the plant, and you could argue that the \"two button controls\" theme is there because there are only two choices on the screen at one time?  Would that count?</p>\n<p>There was <em>a lot </em>I wanted to do in this game that got scrapped because of time--I had no time during the weekend, so this was made in the last four hours in Ludum Dare.  I'm honestly not sure if it's any good, and it's probably not for everyone, but it's a game I needed to make, and I hope it can help someone.</p>\n<p>Feel free to comment below, tweet me @NaomiNorbez, message me at naominorbez.tumblr.com, or e-mail me at mninorbez@gmail.com.
