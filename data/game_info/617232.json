They would try whatever they can to prevent the robot from functioning. Luckily, they could not break the machine, and our humble machine could just work on trashes, as long as time permit .. Or, if there is no trash produced?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Operations</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Collect\u00a0</strong>all the trashes (paper balls) on the ground and<strong>\u00a0shoot\u00a0</strong>them into the trash bin within\u00a0<strong>Time limit</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>Use \" WSAD\" to move the robot. Move mouse to aim, and left-click to shoot. Press space to \"Shake\" cats off the machine if they attach.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Game Design:\u00a0</em>Dennis Liu | Lao Lu\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Level Design:\u00a0</em>Lao Lu\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Art Design:</em>\u00a0Dennis Liu\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Programming:\u00a0</em>Dennis Liu\r\n</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Prof. Brian Winn and the team\u00a0from Penn State University for the excellent game design Cousera courses, as well as the shooting game code skeleton that was borrowed for developing this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Music&amp;SFX credits:</p>\n<p>Jump Landing --\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Macro</p>\n<p>SFX - Plug In, Plug Out --\u00a0CleytonKauffman</p>\n<p>Mouse Imitation ---\u00a0AntumDeluge</p>\n<p>Win Sound #2 --\u00a0remaxim</p>\n<p>Won!
