but not all - of them will be able to be influenced to change their initial desires and motivations.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>- Lighter femdom kinks for the more gentle submissive types, both for the male character and other male and female characters as well<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>- Harsher and more extreme femdom on a separate choice track over time for the main and other characters (avoidable by choices and be warned, some of the characters in this game will be very dark and evil, but of course there will be good and pure characters as well!)\u00a0\u00a0<strong>I really want to warn those that might be sensitive to harsher cruelty to avoid this track as it may be too much for some people!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>I don't want to spoil too many images, so let me list some additional kinks I am planning, but keep in mind the following:\u00a0<strong>while I have an idea what I want for the overall narrative and choices, it is actually YOU, the Patreons that can influence me to specific kinks and ideas of other types of scenes you want over time.\u00a0 I have very concrete and specific ideas, but also am quite open to the people with great ideas that would be supporting this game!\u00a0 I actually believe that while the main endings I have in mind will likely be mostly intact, I also have a feeling there will be some great ideas from Patrons that will make the journey there different in ways I don't see as I write this today.</strong></p>\n<p>Planned additional kinks/themes: (trying to be generalized here, as I have so many ideas on specific kinks within a general area and want to have some surprises!)<br/><br/>- Dominant track over time for male domination, both lighter and a little stronger<br/>- Lesbian content (normal and dom/sub)<br/>- Single romance possibilities<br/>- Harem possibility<br/>- Ability to play selected moments/scenes as family/friends (you can personally name your main character and your friends/family to make it more customized to your liking) with choices that may impact the main character later<br/><br/><br/><br/>I don't want to spoil much more, but let's move to a few last questions!<br/><br/><strong>How often will you update the game?</strong></p>\n<p>Now this is a really loaded question, especially with the situation with the world right now, but the honest truth is that I do have a small business that keeps me pretty busy.\u00a0 However, this does allow me at times to have some flexibility to have a free day or two to work on the game.\u00a0 Now, I really enjoy what I do and make a pretty good living, but I am very passionate about creating this story too!\u00a0 My goal initially is probably roughly every two months, but I am so new to this and I want to be sure each release is good in quality, rather than being rushed out to make a specific time.\u00a0 So two months is my goal but please don't always count on it as life can throw curve balls!\u00a0 If I feel it is taking way too long, I will pause billing at some point to the next update.\u00a0 I don't want to rip off anyone or make people feel bad about supporting me!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>I CAN promise that I will always work super hard to give you a good value to the best of my ability!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why should I become a Patreon?</strong></p>\n<p>If you enjoy what I create, I hope you will consider it!\u00a0 The most typical expense is just buying the assets needed to create pictures and scenes for the story!\u00a0 Some of them are $50 to use in a commercial game as a licensed asset, so they really add up!\u00a0\u00a0I also someday would like to be able to upgrade my computer as it's a limited GPU (6 GB only) and this has limited my ability to create exactly what I want with each picture.<br/><br/>Above all though, if you enjoy what I am creating, I would greatly appreciate if you would consider being a Patron.\u00a0 Even the smallest donation is 100% appreciated by me, and I promise to strive to give each and every person good value for their commitment to me!\u00a0 Thank you so much for reading my page and please enjoy yourselves!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T06:44:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a56/a56be6ccd51c1afcc74566db800c00b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrymGudinnaGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
