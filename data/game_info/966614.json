{"id": 966614, "slug": "77p-egg-eggwife", "name": "77p egg: Eggwife", "name_original": "77p egg: Eggwife", "description": "77p egg: Eggwife is a crude, gory, toilet-humour-driven first-person shooter inspired by the likes of Postal 2, Duke Nukem 3D, Goat Simulator, and a general tone of \"good enough\" during development; an attempt at embracing the jankiness that comes with making your first game.<br/><br/>Set in Sheffie, England, you play as 77p egg; a potty-mouthed stick figure briefly mourning the loss of its wife, who finds itself on an epic adventure when a trip to the supermarket to find a new life partner gets a little bit weird. <br/><br/><ul><li>Fight your way through angry hordes of <strong>sentient sewage</strong>, such as <strong>gelatinous blobs of urine</strong>, <strong>mechanised napalm poo tanks</strong>, <strong>4ft long tampon helicopters laced with nails</strong>, and many more. There's a <strong>milk-worshipping cult</strong> too and they're also pretty upset.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>10 story levels</strong> set in, around, and underneath the city of Sheffie, plus two (currently) endless-wave arena levels, and a handful of not-very-good bonus levels.<br/><br/></li><li>Blast your enemies with an arsenal of <strong>\"\"\"UK-Legal\"\"\" weaponry</strong> such as the <strong>Applicator</strong> - a scoped, long-range tampon applicator; the <strong>7-Barrel Sh*tgun</strong>; the <strong>Crossbowner</strong> - a silicone-shootin' crossbow designed for the bedroom; the <strong>Stigmatic 77,000</strong> - a high-power, high rate-of-fire nailgun; and many more!!!<br/><br/></li><li>Master various bodily functions and fast-paced movement to stay alive!! <strong>Strafe-running</strong>, <strong>unlocked vertical aiming</strong> (okay that one isn't crucial at all but feels cool/stupid) and <strong>poop-jumping</strong> will keep you one step ahead of your foes. <strong>Pee on command</strong> to put out fires (even ones on yourself!), incapacitate certain enemies, or just draw pretty pictures on walls. Make sure to eat lots of food to keep your poop meter full - you'll need it not only to stock your Sh*tgun, but to double jump too!<br/><br/><strong>Needless amounts of interactivity </strong>and detail in parts of the game that really don't matter!!!! Stick a fork in a plug socket and get zapped! Flush toilets! Talk to pedestrians! Ride shopping carts! Take a poop the size of a bus! <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Six difficulty levels</strong>: \"flaccid\", \"Semi\", \"Hard\", \"Knotty\", \"RAGING\", and \"dysfunction\" - the latter of which randomises much of the game's content such as the rotation of level geometry, weapon functionality, movement, and more; making it potentially much easier to complete a level, or perhaps impossible.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Replayability!!!</strong> Try a <strong>pacifist run</strong> where you don't kill anything! Or blow off some steam trying to get a <strong>pass-a-fist run</strong> where you ensure <strong>everything is dead<strong>. For a unique and honestly really annoying challenge, attempt a <strong>vegan run</strong>!! There's also an endless wave-based arena mode with its own arenas, a card-picking system for powerups and powerdowns, and some unique enemy variants!<br/><br/></strong></strong></li><li>An original soundtrack by General Mumble, sc.Dave!, ipi, Koa, and more; spanning all sorts of genres from metal to ambient to reggae to... *checks wikipedia...* s-...scrumpy &amp; western. <br/><br/></li><li> <strong>BIG-ASS CLIFFHANGER ENDING</strong> that will make you BEG us to do a sequel. Eggwife is a complete, even a bit overwhelming, gaming experience but the saga doesn't end there. Like all the great stories told by humanity - The Old Man and the Sea, Jersey Shore,  The Hobbit. and such - it leaves room for the plot to continue and characters to return. </li></ul><br/><strong>Do you have what it takes to help 77p egg find love once again?</strong> Just making sure you don't forget that's what this game is about.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T02:51:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41de6d95de7b0cf6f5d7b1595748a920.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["77p Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hyperstrange"], "esrb_rating": null}
