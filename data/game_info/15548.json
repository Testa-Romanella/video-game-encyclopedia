{"id": 15548, "slug": "congo-merc", "name": "Congo Merc", "name_original": "Congo Merc", "description": "During the 1960s the newly independent Congo was the scene of constant warfare. Congo Merc puts you in the middle of that fighting with a task force of elite commandos. You conduct breakneck advances into the heart of enemy territory, seize critical objectives and, just as important, return to home base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBased on the board game by Decision Games, Congo Merc includes everything from hostage rescue to tracking down Cuban cadre. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including jeep-mounted commandos, light armor, sappers, air support, paratroopers and many others.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce a task force is organized, you maneuver it into the Congo. The map covers the entire country, and when a force enters certain points an event occurs. Events can include anything from UN intervention to ambushes by enemy fighters. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba7585cfc6f73eee316821afebe4ee2.jpg", "website": "https://www.hexwar.com/downloads/congo-merc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 80}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["HexWar Games", "Dreamwalker Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["HexWar Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
