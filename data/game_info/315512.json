However,\u00a0this game wouldn't have been made if it wasn't for some great tutorials by people like Blackthornprod and Brackeys - as well as inspiration from people like Amanda, Albin, Erik and Simon.</p>There's more on the way<p>Stay tuned on my\u00a0Tumblr where I will post updates on development and\u00a0game releases.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c7e89fadd61f6ee0a40d522c5221c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["OskarNystrom"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
