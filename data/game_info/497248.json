The rampant destitution, corruption, and desperation means nothing to them. But it means something to you.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re the reason that Constables are brought in from the outside. Whether you were one previously or never had the chance, you\u2019re more than capable of performing your own investigations, and twisting the narrative and evidence you uncover to suit your own needs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are strange forces lurking in the city of Duskvol. Find them, make them your own. Show the unbelievers that they are right to be afraid. If there is to be a reckoning, let it be your own.</p>\n<p><em>What caused you to start your own newspaper?
