Therefore it is pretty hard to play this game with a keyboard and mouse but i might make a PC version.\u00a0So if there are any weird bugs on any other devices then thats probably why. Or its just because im terrible at programming and my code is broken D: Please report any bugs you might find :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T04:16:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c5/5c566d6ae03e78d12eb8c2d091ce1982.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sibeBNils"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
