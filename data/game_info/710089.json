You want to do this for fun, and you type down everything you want to about the last dream you had so you can remember them all. The first few nights are normal, and you play through levels that are fun and not too challenging. But then one night, you have a strange dream. You get a message saying something that causes you to rethink everything. It says something about how you must stop typing down every dream you have, humans are not meant to remember their dreams as much as you are. So naturally, you rebel, and continue recording your dreams. As you get further and further, things get weirder and weirder. Warnings keep coming, and then you start getting scared, but you realize you\u2019ve gone too deep now, and you can\u2019t stop. You\u2019ve learned too much already, and if you stop, none of it would be worth it. You\u2019re already being hunted down. So you continue, to see if you can find the truth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:22:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dc4729d97cfa4dddd900da1af83fd8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hanxmorrr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
