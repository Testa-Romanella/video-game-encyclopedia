There are three different types of missions, depending on what type of vehicle you choose. Choose one of many buses to transport passengers around the city. Jump in as a taxi driver and give a lift to clients waving their hands around the city. Choosing a race car, opens up Checkpoint racing tracks in the city. For each customer serviced or race finished, you get experience points, which unlock additional vehicles and locations. For each vehicle there are unlockable upgrades and paint jobs. Upgrades and paint jobs are unlocked simply by earning experience with that vehicle. Drive carefully! When you crash, passengers fall and you lose experience.<br/><br/>\u2022 Fully modeled 3D environments and vehicles.<br/>\u2022 Interior and exterior view with free look.<br/>\u2022 Realistic physics and ragdoll.<br/>\u2022 Accident replays with screenshot possibility.<br/>\u2022 Different control options.<br/>\u2022 Bus driving.<br/>\u2022 Taxi driving.<br/>\u2022 Van driving.<br/>\u2022 Bonus cars and races.<br/>\u2022 Leaderboards.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T20:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac8/ac8ed7b8cb1d253031a1b64aca554581_rHOwRVW.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Daniel Viktorin Games", "SkisoSoft"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Daniel Viktorin Games", "SkisoSoft OU"], "esrb_rating": null}
