{"id": 478643, "slug": "wind-up-ducks", "name": "Wind-Up Ducks", "name_original": "Wind-Up Ducks", "description": "<p>Command a hoard of ducks to protect your clock from enemies!</p>\n<p>*I highly recommend playing full screen</p>\n<p>Made for the 4th Brackeys game jam. The theme is \"rewind\". I used \"rewind\" as the act of winding something up again. So in this game, you control an army of wind-up ducks who constantly need to be re-winded.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions are in the game and it's fun to figure out the tricks,\u00a0but some people have trouble understanding the game,\u00a0so here is a more thorough explanation for those who need it:</p>\n<p>- <strong>O</strong><strong>bjective</strong> : Protect the clock from enemy ducks. Yellow ducks are yours, any others are enemies. You need to command your ducks to fight enemy troops. You cannot directly attack enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- <strong>W</strong><strong>inding</strong>: Your ducks need to be winded up before they can do anything. Hold the left mouse button or the z key while near the duck to wind it.\u00a0The bronze color health bar shows how much they have been winded. After that has been depleted, they will go to sleep. Sleeping ducks don't do anything. They have a black health bar, once that's depleted they are gone forever. So re-wind your ducks.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Sleep:\u00a0</strong>Ducks can still be asleep when they are winded. Go near the duck and right click. If it's asleep, it will wake up. If it's awake, it will go to sleep.\u00a0 Active ducks\u00a0seek out enemies. They attack automatically once they are in range. Sleeping ducks deplete their energy much slower and can be pushed around by the player.</p>\n<p>That's it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/026/026597f68e0d2b6de92b929f78fda7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PatAle"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
