As you do so, the world reacts to your passage, evolving and building into something altogether different. </p>\n<p>From the team at Friend &amp; Foe Games, Vane is a stunning, emotional and unnerving experience. Developed with the conviction that players should find their own path through the world, the result is a minimalistic, stark environment that encourages exploration just to the edge of getting lost, set to an all-original brooding synth soundtrack.</p>", "metacritic": 56, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-21T18:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a7e/a7e6a71fa0094acec20749c73925961b.jpg", "website": "http://www.friendandfoegames.com/vane/", "rating": 3.32, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 64, "owned": 750, "beaten": 16, "toplay": 44, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 31, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Friend & Foe", "Friend & Foe Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Friend & Foe", "Friend & Foe Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
