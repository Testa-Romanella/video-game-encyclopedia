Our game can be played with eyes closed and ears wide open! Forest jump is a flash game that aims to integrate people with disabilities and thus become \"physically\" accessible to all humans on Earth.<br/></p>\n<p>A litter of 5 chicks lives at the top of a very tall tree. Attracted by<br/>discovery and adventure, they try to take flight under the<br/>the kindly gaze of their parents. All succeed, except one, who cannot<br/>not steal. As the chick launches itself into the void, it falls at the foot of<br/>the tree. It's not like its brothers, its wings don't allow it to fly.<br/>Filled with determination, he decides to climb back to his nest alone. He then discovers a hidden ability, that of climbing trees by jumping from branch to branch. A special ability that his brothers and sisters do not possess. He then proves to his family and to himself that just because he can't fly, doesn't mean he can't advance. After this discovery and personal questioning, the young chick embarks on an adventure that no one would have believed.</p>\n<p>This game isn't over yet. We created it as part of our studies in less than a week. It's a prototype, so there are some gameplay issues and the story is not in the game yet! We will try to update it quickly!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T08:35:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/4260aed3832bd7d978c9d95ce323c321.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justine Le Bervet"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
