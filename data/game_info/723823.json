You can only escape from</p>\n<p>roaming enemies.</p>\n<p>- STATS -\u00a0</p>\n<p>EGO - Health points. The target is defeated if Ego reaches 0.</p>\n<p>SWAG - Skill points. Allies and enemies alike can only use skills so much.</p>\n<p>ATTACK - Damage. Higher the number, the more Ego they deplete when attacking foes.</p>\n<p>DEFENSE - Armor. Higher the number, the less Ego is depleted when being attacked.</p>\n<p>SPEED - Agility. Turn order is determined by whoever has the highest speed down to the lowest.</p>\n<p>LUCK - Crit chance. The higher the number, the more likely the attack will be critical.</p>\n<p>SOCIAL CREDIT - Experience. Gained from winning battles, and increases all stats at certain levels.</p>\n<p>DOUBLOONS - Money. Spend it at shops for invaluable items.</p>\n<p>- TIPS -</p>\n<p>&gt; Buffs and debuffs only stack once. Applying a defense debuff to an enemy who already has 2 will</p>\n<p>not do anything other than reset the timer, which is 5 turns.</p>\n<p>&gt; Keep up the pressure. You only win the battle when the opponent's Ego reaches zero. Never stop\u00a0</p>\n<p>attacking for long.</p>\n<p>&gt; Enemies are powerful. Make sure to SAVE at Carl Bot often and HEAL at a restore point near him.</p>\n<p>&gt; Buffs and debuffs can be game changers. Play carefully against enemies who can either buff\u00a0</p>\n<p>themselves or debuff you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>&gt; Heal often. Your squishy allies are prime targets to be killed if they are below 50% Ego.</p>\n<p>&gt; Enemies with high attack are incredibly aggressive and will slaughter your party in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Fight fire with fire and defeat them as fast as possible to minimize time taking their hits.</p>\n<p>&gt; Enemies with high defense are extremely vulnerable to debuff items. Put aside your first turn to\u00a0</p>\n<p>take away their key strength.</p>\n<p>---- ALLIES ----</p>\n<p>[[Beard]]</p>\n<p>- Jack of All Trades</p>\n<p>LVL 1\u00a0 - JACK OF CLUBS\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 20\u00a0 - Attacks one enemy twice</p>\n<p>LVL 3\u00a0 - QUEEN OF HEARTS\u00a0 \u00a0 - 25\u00a0 - Restores all Ego for Beard</p>\n<p>LVL 6\u00a0 - KING OF DIAMONDS\u00a0 \u00a0- 35\u00a0 - Raises all stats for Beard</p>\n<p>LVL 10 - ACE OF SPADES\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 100 - Brutally attacks all enemies</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beard is an excellent brawler and is keen on both taking it and dishing it out. He</p>\n<p>deals substantial damage, can sustain himself and increase his own effectiveness.</p>\n<p>He is the core of winning every battle.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>[[Sentro]]</p>\n<p>- High Luck, Low Swag Costs</p>\n<p>LVL 1\u00a0 - FUNNY JUICE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 10\u00a0 - Restores a random amount of Ego for one ally</p>\n<p>LVL 3\u00a0 - GRADITUDE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 25\u00a0 - Drains Ego from two random enemies and heals Sentro</p>\n<p>LVL 6\u00a0 - RPG\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 20\u00a0 - Deals colossal damage, but rarely hits</p>\n<p>LVL 10 - DIE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - 75\u00a0 - Either fully restores all allies or slowmodes enemies*</p>\n<p>*Sentro's Ego drops to 0 once this skill is used</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Sentro is an oddball where anything can happen. You could play it safe and use him as cannon fodder,</p>\n<p>but his real power comes when you dish out his RNG skills.
