It\u2019s time to travel across all of Australia, to complete The Great Bunnings Snag Adventure. With 8 stops all around the country, and 8 delicious snags to collect, there is no telling who you will meet on this amazing journey.</p>\n<p>-\r\n </p>\n<p>Controls\r\n </p>\n<p>W, A, S and D to move around.\r\n </p>\n<p>Left Click to interact with buttons.\r\n </p>\n<p>Z to open your stop list, and X to close the list.\r\n </p>\n<p>Left Shift to go to Bunnings.\r\n </p>\n<p>-\r\n </p>\n<p>The Great Bunnings Snag Adventure was apart of a 12 week long, Game a Week course for university,\u00a0where we were given a theme, and were tasked with making a game in 1 week. The theme for this game was \u2018Australia\u2019, so I made the most Australian thing I could think of. This game was made in the 8th\u00a0week of the course.</p>\n<p>The game is a little buggy, mainly when you try and go to Bunnings, sometimes it doesn\u2019t register you\u2019ve pressed the shift key. Moving slightly or trying to press it again should fix it.\r\n </p>\n<p>Rated 10/10 by a Bunnings employee.\r\n </p>\n<p>All the artwork seen in game is made by myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19b55d50e8bc0e6866beebf3a67e412d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Holzycookie"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
