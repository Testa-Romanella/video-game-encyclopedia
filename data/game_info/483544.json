Without her contributions, we would not have any product to offer... it would have been truly doomed.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:35:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/9404317f01ddf24cdde71a16e1afb77b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Cooked Pancakes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
