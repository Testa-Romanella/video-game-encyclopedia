In creating this prototype, I learnt how to add music and sound effects and\u00a0 how to create dynamic endless repeating backgrounds, which are critical for any side-scrolling games. Finally, I incorporated particle effects like splatters and explosions, which make your games so much more satisfying to play.</p>\n<p>By completing\u00a0this unit I am now\u00a0able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use GameObject.Find and GetComponent to manipulate the components of the current or other game objects\r\n</li>\n<li>Tweak the gravity of your project with Physics.gravity and use ForceModes to apply forces in different ways\r\n</li>\n<li>Utilize new operators like \u201c&amp;&amp;\u201d and bool variables to better control game logic\r\n</li>\n<li>Freeze or constrain the RigidBody component to halt movement on certain axes\r\n</li>\n<li>Use tags to label game objects and call them in the code\r\n</li>\n<li>Use script communication to access the methods and variables of other scripts\r\n</li>\n<li>Manage animation states in the Animator Controller, including adjusting the states\u2019 parameters and default state \r\n</li>\n<li>Use SetTrigger, SetBool, and SetInt methods to trigger transitions between animation states\r\n</li>\n<li>Stop and play particle effects to correspond with character animation states\r\n</li>\n<li>Work with Audio Sources and Listeners to play background music\r\n</li>\n<li>Add sound effects to add polish to your project\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T07:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5b/d5b0aff3487427219d8121034f755699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lewis Stephens"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
