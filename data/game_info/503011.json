It was made for Ludum Dare 47 - other participants can rate the game here (thanks! :smile:)<br/></p>\n<p>Like most other game jam entries, <strong>while(1) {}</strong> is far from complete\u2026 But I\u2019m mostly happy with what I made in the available time.</p>\n<p>The core game mechanic <em>was</em> going to be starting with only NAND gates and unlocking another logic gate per level by constructing an equivalent logical circuit; potentially aided by a small cast of characters and simple narrative to help you along your journey. Instead, NAND, NOT, AND, OR, and XOR gates are all unlocked from the outset, and there is only one sandbox-like level where you can just experiment with building things as you please. The image below shows a D flip-flop.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Get new components from the \u2018Components\u2019 menu in the top-left. (The other menus aren\u2019t yet functional!)</li><li>Click and drag to move components</li><li>Click and drag between two input / output nodes to connect them</li><li>Click a node to disconnect it</li><li>Drag a component to the \u2018Delete area\u2019 at the bottom of the screen to delete it</li><li>Click an input node to toggle its state (blue wire = on / 1, red wire = off / 0)<ul><li>A grey wire means its input node is in a disconnected / high-impedance state. This can automatically occur after disconnecting another component.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/733/733f0f138b59a3e1015065671fb15999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cakemonitor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
