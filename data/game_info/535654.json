The objective of the game is fairly straight forward - trolls will spawn in increasing numbers and rush towards you.  Your job is to click on their heads.  If you do that, you progress.  If you don't, you lose the game when they touch you.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo practice a little with this game, and eventually your...friend...will regret that they ever brought up the phrase.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T03:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e47b2d67e0db5ac70a021320b6bb1ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nateception Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Nateception Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
