Be careful, as in this game boulders and rocks are your legendary enemies! <br/><br/>You start off as a little boulder, but the more trees you trample, the bigger your inferno becomes stronger and turns into a classic arcade action style game fun for all ages. Be careful though the floor on the side is water, and not lava! The water will turn your super inferno into a little fire boulder again that is not hot.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df416c8b05d57f488f9ba87ec99ea0c2_XbVY7yX.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Adknown"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Adknown"], "esrb_rating": null}
