Have you ever fantasized about running down government hallways as a ghoulish 4-legged fiend? 51 Run is exactly what you\u2019re looking for. Cryptid lovers rejoice in this fast-paced, endless runner through a government facility where a variety of creatures, including you, have broken containment. Familiar faces such as the Mothman, the Yeti, unusually large spiders (also called J\u2019ba Fofi), shadow creatures, and of course, Champ the Lake Champlain monster. Players traverse the level as the famous Chupacabra and must fly, walk, and run in some combination in order to avoid rogue cryptids attacking everything in sight, and hazardous government architecture. Controls are simple and intuitive with a WASD + SPACE layout, and players may hold the S key while flying to initiate a dive \u2013 a useful tool when faced with fast-approaching hazards. Speaking of hazards, players are offered a choice when they are faced with randomly generated forks in the road where they have to choose a hallway to go down. Player's progress is tracked through distance traveled, time played, and how many correct hallways the player has went down during the game. Go down the right hallway and the game will continue as usual, but go down the wrong hallway and you're in trouble! When a player goes down the wrong hallway the speed of the game increases for the duration of that hallway providing an exciting and fast-paced challenge.
