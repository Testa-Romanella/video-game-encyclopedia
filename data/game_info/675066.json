Your only task is to find your way back to the safety of your bedroom. By solving puzzles and following the soft blue glow of a friendly spirit you can overcome the pain of your anxieties.<br/><br/>Shudder is a point and click art game designed to convey the experience of disassociation\u00a0and\u00a0anxiety, represented by the eerie yellow tentacles that can lurk at every corner. The developers each have their own experiences with mental health struggles and wanted to portray some of those through the style and design of the game, making this a project very close to all of our hearts.</p>\n<p>This game is entirely animated by hand using stop motion animation to create a style that cannot be replicated by traditional 2D or 3D styles. To achieve this look our 2 animators spent countless hours hand crafting backgrounds, sets, props, and characters. These assets were then photographed and animated on blue screens then rotoscoped into sprite sheets usable in Unity (a long process, but worth it).</p>\n<p>Thank you to our friends, families, and partners who supported us during this project and to the faculty and staff at DePaul University.<br/><br/>Shudder was created by: Gabi Fernandez, Marina Gaglio and Kaiya Hietikko<br/><br/>Lead Developer: Kaiya Hietikko<br/>Fabricators and Animators: Marina Gaglio and Gabi Fernandez<br/>Supervising Sound Designer: Jonah Fiden<br/>Original Score by: Rashaad Bacchus<br/>Sound Designers: Andee Call, Ethan Barnedo, Harrison Hanneman, Nate Andrade<br/><br/>Developers Note: The movement will cause you to fly off screen, this is a bug I couldn't fix in time. Clicking the ground should keep her grounded.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T07:26:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/501/50149a8533d67321d23e0411fe9d16bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaihie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
