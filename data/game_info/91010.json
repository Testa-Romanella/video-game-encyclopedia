I'm warning you now so you don't want to... /pun/ch me in the face later</em><em>.</em></p><p>You can unlock Yvin's route after finishing either Florien or Anton's!</p><p>This game is extremely straightforward, so there's no walkthrough necessary.</p><p><strong>Characters </strong><br/></p><p><strong>Florien: </strong>Ciel's childhood friend and knight who is set on protecting her, but also supports Ciel's independence just wants her to be happy. He's kind to Ciel, but is sarcastic and cold to almost everything else. He hates puns.</p><p><strong>Anton: </strong>Florien's older brother and captain of Amarine's royal knights.
