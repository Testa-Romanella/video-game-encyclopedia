Sneak into the neighborhood, root through trash and root some new hats.</p>\n<p>Watch out, if you get caught by the guards, it will be a grizzly scene.</p>\n<p>Use stealth and subterfuge to make your way through a quiet sleepy neighborhood and find the choicest bits of refuse to flip for cold hard cash. Watch out for the neighborhood watch, who are on patrol to make sure no one's grass is overgrown, if they keep you in their high beams for too long the gig is up and you need to wait for another night to find the goods.
