You've just built a roaring fire when you realize that these are no ordinary woods. The spirits of the forest don't like your fire, and they are coming from the mists to put it out! How long do you think you can hold them off?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nForest Phantoms is a first-person mini-game challenge to survive as long as possible by simultaneously keeping a fire fed with sticks and using torches to beat back an advancing horde of forest ghouls who are attempting to throw snow onto your fire to douse it. Last as long as you can to beat your best time!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T21:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/40868ef75a7c9fe776fb41f6af02e46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sebastian Brown", "Justin Freeman"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The School of Future Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
