Your objective is to cross the Moon through 30 stages. Walk, jump, dodge obstacles and use moving platforms to move through the levels and reach new dimensions. Despite the simple gameplay it is not a 100% linear game, as there will be times when you will have to choose which way to go, but you will only know that you chose the wrong path when it is too late.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Easy controls<br/><br/></li><li> 30 levels<br/><br/></li><li> Non-linear<br/><br/></li><li> Checkpoints<br/><br/></li><li> Save game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T03:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/4596ebf94d37bf5091c7a75c8b478315.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Buck"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["One Buck"], "esrb_rating": null}
