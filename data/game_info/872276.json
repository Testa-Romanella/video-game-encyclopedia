Empty scrolls exist to do nothing but fill you empty belly, whilst special pieces contain scrolls that may just give you an edge. Poison scrolls are the real threats, eat too many and you may see yourself looking at the gates of heaven themselves!</p>\n<p>Each meal comes with three courses, a starter, main, and dessert course.
