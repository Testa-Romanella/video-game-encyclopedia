The interesting thing about\u00a0the cabinet of curisoities is, that the objects displayed, are taken away from their origins and placed in correlation with artefacts from\u00a0other times and cultures. Thereby the visitor can recontextualise the objects and\u00a0associations into new stories and structures.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0In this virtual experience you are able to walk through a sphrerical room where you will find extremely different objects placed. You can grab those, delete them, add new ones, scale them, turn them around and build up stories by relating them to others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The shape of the room and the objects aim to provide a huge variety of perspectives and angles to watch the scene you are building,\u00a0\u00a0to make it an inspiring experience that might also end up in creating\u00a0new projects.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game!</p>\n\n<p>Miro:\u00a0https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg5fqBo=/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T08:45:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18bbd3d491a0048cac074c77d9c3dd5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["./studio3 Virtual Reality Seminar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
