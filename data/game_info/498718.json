This is my first game jam and I had a really fun time up until the last day when I was fixing issues and finishing the game. My Dorm at my college burst a pipe and we had flooding so i got kicked out of my room for 2 hours, i ended up needing about 1 hour at most of time to fix the problems. you can fight any of the bosses I made but you can fight the basic enemies and play around with the powers, the bars that you see after the room with the punching bags will disappear at 10 minutes intervals\u00a0 but you can still use the powers under them. Either way I hope you have fun playing and I will be updating this game to make is complete in the future. Still had fun to the very end!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd4/dd4ab30f970f31f6aa79c2bb202dbdee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Serpierer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
