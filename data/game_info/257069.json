Story-driven decision-based detective game experienced from a unique perspective.<br/><br/>The videogame is set in a dystopic world of the State. The State has recently undergone a violent revolution and rapidly restructures. In a year, it transitioned from a totalitarian regime and now struggles to establish a republic. Provisional Government lustrated most of the public servants so capital needs fresh blood. You win the Labor Lottery to work at Metropolis(pretend you read these names for the first time), capital of the State. The hero, Daemon Mardoch, accepts the summon leaving countryside life with his wife and kids back in the Town. The transfer to Metropolis promises a fulfilling job, good money, and many opportunities. You were born there, your mother still resides in the capital and works for the government. But it's not the only reason you accepted the offer. Your father disappeared during the revolution and his fate is still unknown to this day.<h3>Judge &amp; Detective</h3>The game has 2 layers: your job as a judge and your personal investigation into what happened to your father.<br/><br/><br/>Judge's duty<br/>The first layer is your job. This is NOT an accurate simulation of what a judge's job is. It is a fictionalized distillation of it. We didn't aim for realism, we want you to have fun doing it.<br/><br/>Hero's duty<br/>The latter layer is about your investigation into the fate of your father. This part will look like a quest or... you call it a visual novel. Not a weird one, we promise...or maybe not.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>The story is tailored by choices.  Well, not really but there are multiple endings<br/></li><li>Read the reactions to your sentences and learn what's happening in 3 newspapers, each with different points of view. The most trusted news sources in the State <br/></li><li>Find you father. We knew you liked a thousand plots about it before.<br/></li><li>Keep in touch in your family by letters. At least here she will text you first<br/></li><li>You can call people using an oddly satisfying rotary dialer. Pranks, hoaxes and threats<br/></li><li>Beautiful illustrations. 2 frames or no animation whatsoever<br/></li><li>Dating sim. Cheat on your in-game waifu<br/></li><li>Try human flesh. Or the flesh will...try you?<br/></li><li>Old fashioned Quest/text adventure. It's actually a visual novel<br/></li><li>Politically incorrect and dark humor. Bad humor. The jokes are like... really bad </li></ul><h3>Note:</h3>The universe of Femida is generalized and draws inspiration from different cultures and historical events. We don't make allusions to any particular real-life political parties or figures, neither do we promote any political message. The game illustrates corruption, confirmation bias, prejudice, the presumption of guilt.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffee4a80771fbaac0bfbeac918891d10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["loznevoy", "Art Interactive"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Roman Loznevoy"], "esrb_rating": null}
