Ever wanted to mow through a horde of anarchistic sheep with a shotgun? What a coincidence.</p><p>Play as Muzzah, a down-to-earth good ol' kiwi farming bloke, as he fights his way through a horde of anarchistic sheep. There are 30 million sheep in New Zealand, and they're sick and tired of being involved in a system that doesn't benefit them.<br/> <br/> </p><p>RUMINANT REVENGE is a Metalslug-esque, 2d arena shooter, set in a picturesque, pixelated southern New Zealand. Stylistically influenced by modernist New Zealand artists, and arcade shooters from the 90's, this game is a blend of simplicity and humility, contrasting with over-the-top gore and fast paced action. Muzzah's little legs can't support the weight of his huge farm-fed body, and so in order to get around, he uses his trusty sawn-off shotgun to launch himself through the air. A game based around ideas of timing and positioning, mastery of the simple mechanics is required to survive the punishing gameplay. </p><p>List of features:</p> <ul><li>-All original sounds and music</li><li>-Shotgun jumping!</li><li>-Multiple farmyard animals to brutally murder</li><li>-Excessive animated violence!</li><li>-Genuine kiwi lingo</li><li>-Picturesque pixelated Otago plains and Southern Alps</li><li>-Kiwi architecture</li><li>-Intense difficulty over time</li><li>-Simple mechanics</li><li>-Unlimited shotgun ammo, as fast as you can fire!</li></ul> <p>Contact: radski100@gmail.com,</p><p>Release: 26th June, 2015</p><p>Platform: Windows pc</p><p>Pricing: Free</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["radski"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
