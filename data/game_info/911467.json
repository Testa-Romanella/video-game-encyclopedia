No bullshit storyline, No uncontrolled animation. Just there for you when you are feeling horny.<br />\nWhen you enter the simulator, you will be able to choose which ever girl, then you will be entering a room with two playable buttons, where one is action refers to continuous action of intercourse, and the other cum button is referring to ending the animations. This is a 3d person game simulator, and players can move around the house to observe closely, as well as different angles of the high-definition girls and the furniture. The girls are made with high definition meaning it contains high poly count, this is why the actual file size is a little bit big. However, the high-definition poly count model is the key for this simulator as we aimed for the best graphics for simulating realism while maintaining playable game. The environment background is a simple night sky metropolitan to create the feeling of busy city. And finally, a very simple jazzy background music for you to enjoy the simulator.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T11:22:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/60e/60e2d5f6d59825017369f4b6128ceb30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astor Grayson"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astor Grayson"], "esrb_rating": null}
