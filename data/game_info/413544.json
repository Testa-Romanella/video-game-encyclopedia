WHILE OTHER MODS I'VE MADE ARE FINE, THIS ONE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU JUMP...\r\n<p><strong>\"Garbage\" IGN-</strong><br/><br/>Oh hello! Welcome to The Spikes.. OH NOES! The Schoolhouse has gone a muck! But Baldi's got a new school up his sleeve with a deadly new enemy, the spikes.. Gotta Sweep is gone and the Principal had to get creative so he replaced him with a\u00a0Wall of Spikes that can\u00a0kill\u00a0you the instant you touch it..\u00a0Have fun playing!<br/><br/>Gotta Sweep has been replaced by a wall of spikes that can\u00a0kill\u00a0you immediately, so Baldi is taking a backseat and not coming for you anymore. Other characters are still active though and immune to the deadly spikes. Most of the items aside from two are all replaced by BSODAs to push away the spikes to give you extra help during this challenge.<br/><br/>Sorry for any bugs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:45:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb9f9f879d4626acebf0007dfb4c718.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rapparep lol"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
