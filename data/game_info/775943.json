There are ten levels that scale in difficulty. The players jump on each other to reach higher platforms and press buttons or levers to remove colored blocks. The objective is to reach the flag at the end of the level.<br/></p>\n\n<p>If either player presses their merge key and the two squares are close enough together, the squares will merge into a single large orange block. Both players have control over the large square, which can press large buttons and isn\u2019t impacted by wind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T13:10:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/154/15443974073ebcc947800cc4a563735a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["False Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
