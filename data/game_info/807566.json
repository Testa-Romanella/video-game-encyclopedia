Tulu, the universe's greatest hero has been sent to earth to investigate what has happened.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Version 0.1:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1 world containing 18 levels and 1 boss.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Control menu can be found by pressing \"ESC\" and clicking on \"Controls\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future of the game:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This project is my first mostly playable game. I started this project with the intent on improving my skills with Godot. The game, in its current state is very limited and that will become apparent when you play it. Despite this, I have been able to learn a lot from this project.</p>\n<p>I may continue polishing and adding new levels into the project. But right now I happy with where it is, as a short little experience. I had to force myself to release it in its current state. If I hadn't I would have never released it. I did not want to leave it rotting on my hard drive.</p>\n<p>Feedback is appreciated. The purpose of this project is for me to get better and feedback is very handy.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>References:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Ai follow code used for reference from: Gonkee |\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/Gonkee<br/></p>\n<p>Pick up object code used for reference from: Jean Makes Games | https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HtDwwKOq2S2mJZCmPB1rw<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Creator:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Charles O'Loughlan - Art, Programming, Sound, Story<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T11:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75da5186a064852077e0c5ddd4fedff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
