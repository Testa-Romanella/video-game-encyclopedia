Luckily, you have a large arsenal of upgradeable defensive towers. These towers use laser beams, shock waves, fire and many other weapons to fight off droids. You can also trick the curious robots by building shiny decoy towers - they're irresistible, droids can't help but investigate them.BE STRATEGIC<br/>Your resources are limited. Make smart use of them and decide well where and when to place defense towers. Many droids have unique abilites, they can repair each other, cloak themselves, teleport or fly across your line of defense. Even though the game happens in real-time, you can pause the gameplay whenever you want and take your next actions while time is frozen.UNCOVER THE TRUTH<br/>As you play through the campaign, you slowly gain insight into what caused this invasion.
