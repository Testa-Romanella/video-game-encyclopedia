You can only play 1/2 of the first route, and it's pretty embarrassing because I'm pretty sure that most late games in the Secret Santa game jam are pretty high quality since there the developers had extra work time, on top of the regular jam time that they used. Sorry if this game's not as good as the rest of the games because I kept getting distracted.</p>\r\nThe Story\r\n<p>It's Oaklest(hope that's not a slur that I haven't heard about)'s birthday party, and you're going to it. However, all of your friends want to bring something different to it. Getti and Tone want to bring a personal cake for Oaklest, Hucklebarry and his friends want to bring some paint for a famous artist, and Costu and Huck(i need to figure out an anagram for that one) want to bring a keyboard for some famous... K-pop....\u00a0musicians? Ok, I guess the story doesn't make a lot of sense, but you get the point. They each want you to come with them to help them deliver the gifts, and choice determines the adventure you will go on.</p>\r\nControls n' Features\r\n<ul><li>A \"text\" adventure but it's more like a visual novel</li><li>Some nature based characters</li><li>Use the left mouse button to progress text(when it's done,) and use the right mouse button to speed it up</li><li>A baseball i guess</li><li>A cake</li><li>A save file system</li><li>2-3 weeks spent working on this</li><li>Art made with fabric but because of time restraints they're not in the game yet; instead, there's programmer art</li><li>There's also some minor swearing but you can censor it if you want</li></ul>\r\nCurrent Bugs\r\n<ul><li>You can't mute the music</li><li>There's a small chance that you might get softlocked due to an overslight; if you do, let me know so I can fix it</li><li>Some characters might or might not exist yet</li><li>The quit button still exists in the WebGL version</li><li>Quitting the game might not work on the Windows version</li><li>Your save file might not be saved on the WebGL version</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>jlintgod- everything</p>\n<p>kristainelorren- their\u00a0secret santa letter inspired this(and also future parts of the game)</p>\n<p>Firelight Technologies- they made FMOD and I used that because my crappy code can't do things like fade in and fade out audio and also do all sorts of things</p>\n<p>Made with FMOD Studio by Firelight Technologies Pty Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>goodbye i guess that's it for season 1 of my games why am i sorting my games in seasons it makes no sense<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T02:57:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/021/0211f019d077a40bceb296c6eed5b716.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jlintgod"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
