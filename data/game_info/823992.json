Ages later, he awakes in his temple, noticing that it has been raided and his Relics are mostly gone, now, he goes on a journey to find his creations, showing no mercy for those that stand in his way.<br/><br/><strong>Game:</strong><br/><br/>The game has a small map with a few enemies to kill.<br/><br/><strong>Development notes:</strong><br/><br/>Relics of Ehrran was made in under 4 months using Java.<br/><br/>This prototype was heavily difficult to program, mainly because we had to use Java as a requirement for the project, apart from that, we lost many of the files for character sprites mid-development\u00a0and the animations became a lot more clunky.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T11:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1c/f1c171c08c90d39330970f382f961c1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ylunn"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
