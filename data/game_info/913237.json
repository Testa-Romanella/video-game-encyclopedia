Or does he?<br/><br/><br/><br/>There will be many ways to overcome these troubles. You can go all in and buy N15 to steamroll through any shootout and make your way anywhere. <br/>If you want challenge you can try to run through everything as fast as you can just with your hands, especially if you do not have enough money for guns. Works in real life too, maybe.<br/>To keep yourself healthy you can find Climbies from Sit or eat some Bluntyes salami. You can also buy them in Bill Of Exchange.<br/>If you want real deal, you should try TTRT tea. They can be found on hardly accessible locations around Haluwa. Or bought in Bill Of Exchange too. But they are pricey.<br/>Do not worry if you forget about these, John will remind you about them in beginning of the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But what if you do not care about pandemic? Worry no more! You can be garbage man or take P Car and deliver mail around Haluwa! You will learn names of roads and earn money this way and as a bonus you will know what it is like to be NPC! <br/><br/><br/><br/>If you are not happy with your looks you can visit the barber or buy new clothes. You can also do this in Deadly Desire. Both will be visible on the map.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As previously mentioned, there are guns. Gun control in Haluwa is non existent therefor you can buy gun as long as you have money to pay for it.<br/>One thing to keep in mind though is that you can not see how many bullets you have in your current magazine. Try to check them if you need to by holding your reload button.<br/>Or do not, you can see how many bullets you have in reserves together with your HP and armor and money when you press Z. At any other time, there is no HUD so that you can appreciate Haluwa in all its beauty.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So there you go. But before you go and lose yourself in the music, the moment, Haluwa, you should know that there is no radar. Your map will not show where you are, just like in good old days.<br/>But do not worry. All the roads have their names registered on the map and sings are all around Haluwa to help you locate yourself, shall you need to.<br/>Others will tell you where to go, map will tell you how to get there and guns will get you through it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And of course...do not trust anyone because....What if they were right?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T03:48:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4af/4af23f95b5248dc0dde65296febb2130.jpg", "website": "https://www.karat-studios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Karat Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Karat Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
