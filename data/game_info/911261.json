As soon as they\u00a0hit the front door the parents called to say they can't make it due to the storm. The objective is to collect all the presents to turn on the lights over the Christmas tree.<br/><br/><br/>There are multiple things to debug/ fix in the future.\u00a0<br/><br/>1. The voice call narrative section didn't work after the implementation</p>\n<p>2. The control menu and Main menu still need to be created.</p>\n<p>3. Doors need to be added.</p>\n<p>4. Properly combine the phone call and notification systems</p>\n<p>5. Add a main Menu\u00a0</p><p>6. Finish the Kitchen</p>\n<p>These will be fixed in time or added to a game jam dedicated to getting games finished.<br/><br/>I missed the window due to 12:00 am and thought I had a little more time than I did.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/076e779cae59ce719112886a206a1f09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mitch Mackay"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
