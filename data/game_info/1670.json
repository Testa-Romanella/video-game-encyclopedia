Magic and technology co-exist in this setting, dragons are real, as well as elves, goblins, dwarves and many other mythological creatures, but they are living in a future world full of hackers and megacorporations. The &quot;shadowrunners&quot; are specialists who perform all sorts of dirty jobs for syndicates and governments. This setting was originally designed for the tabletop games, but since 1990s Shadowrun is also a popular game series, in which Dragonfall is the sixth installment. In Dragonfall, you control a team of shadowrunners, led by your protagonist, in an isometric view. While hacking a data vault in Berlin, your party discovers dangerous secrets that were better left unknown. The characters in your team are highly developed, have backstories and inspire sympathy. To avoid losing your favorite companion, you will have to plan your battles prudently.<br />\nDragonfall was originally a DLC released to support the previous part, Shadowrun Returns. Compared to the standard edition, &quot;Director&#39;s Cut&quot; includes five additional missions, several alternate endings, an improved interface design, a slightly different combat system and a new soundtrack composed by Jon Everist.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2014-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-22T17:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f8/7f8b58994fc420fefaa5fb9992335a11.jpg", "website": "http://harebrained-schemes.com/shadowrun/dragonfall/", "rating": 3.82, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 356, "owned": 3403, "beaten": 226, "toplay": 76, "dropped": 86, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 54, "ratings_count": 356, "suggestions_count": 490, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 359, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Harebrained Schemes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Paradox Interactive", "Harebrained Holdings", "Harebrained Schemes"], "esrb_rating": null}
