Operate the many interfaces on the Junk Driller's control panel to keep the machine in one piece. How far can you drill?</p>\n<p>This is my first solo entry into a game jam, and I had lots of fun with it. It's woefully unfinished (bugs, no sound effects) but the gameplay is all in there. I hope to release a more complete version soon!</p><p>Instructions: Complete the challenges displayed on the monitor in the top-right (if you're lost, a white border appears over areas that need attention). Failing to complete a challenge will cause damage to your driller, forcing it to stop and preventing your score from increasing. Repair the driller by equipping the wrench (left click) and using it on the \"repair\" sign (hold left click) until the driller starts moving again. If the driller's health reaches zero, it will fall apart and the game will end, so keep an eye on that health!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Mouse only.\u00a0 Things colored red means you can interact with them.
