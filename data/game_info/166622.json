As with most sci-fi, it's more about circumstances\r\nof the present than prognostication. We live in catalytic, if not\r\ncataclysmic times. </p>\n<p>\r\nThis iteration explores feelings\r\nof isolation within suburbia and an ambivalence about online\r\nconnectivity as a mode of circumventing it. For many trans women,\r\nonline platforms are our only life line to others like us.\r\nFurthermore, the opportunity to socialize in a disembodied way can be\r\nhighly therapeutic. Nevertheless, neither the architectures of these\r\nspaces, nor the actors within them , are inherently benign. <br/></p>\n<p>For\r\nthis project, I'm indebted to: Open Source Software like Unity,\r\nTwine, but especially Yarn; my friend Seanna Musgrave who helped me code a\r\ncollider; and Lilium\r\nKobayashi\r\nwho made the track, <em>Gaze</em>,\r\nthat appears in the underworld area of my environment.  <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/325ae3b567fd648844972094385b82f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tabitha Nikolai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
