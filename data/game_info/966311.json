{"id": 966311, "slug": "urbo", "name": "URBO", "name_original": "URBO", "description": "URBO offers you the opportunity to build towns on floating islands. You'll watch small houses grow into bigger ones, then bigger ones into even more, slowly filling the space for your town. When you run out of space on one island, a new one will appear, followed by another, and so on until you complete the level.<h3>IMMERSION AWAITS</h3><br/>Dive into the inimitable ambience of URBO, where landscapes delight the eye and puzzles evoke memories of mathematically precise riddles from ancient legends. You shall create cities that can only be seen in dreams. Dreams to be remembered and to which you'd wish to return. URBO is a unique mixture of visual minimalism, relaxing music, meditative game tempo, and puzzles that impress with their elegant solutions.<br/><br/><h3>VARIETY AWAITS</h3><br/>URBO invites you to visit myriad worlds. Futuristic cities floating in the abyss of open space. The capital, hidden in an impregnable canyon in the heart of the desert. The peaceful quarters of a small fishing village nestled on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. URBO is where dreams of distant places come true. You shall see many worlds, existing ones, lost ones, and these that are yet to be found. The choice is yours.<br/><br/><h3>ENIGMAS AWAIT</h3><br/>URBO gives you hours of pleasant moments of contemplation. Under the disguise of simplicity lies a riddle that requires concentration. The riddle that generously rewards an attentive player. URBO is designed so that its nature is clear at first glance. But it will take time and experience to learn how to pick the keys to all the puzzles.<br/><br/><h3>AN ENDLESS PATH AWAITS</h3><br/>There's no ultimate goal in URBO. The rules are very simple: build houses on playing fields of different geometric shapes. From small houses come bigger ones, then even bigger ones, and so on. Thus grows your city and the number of people who call it home. Maybe one day you can build a city that can't expand anymore. But even then there is always a new playing field of a different form, requiring a fresh approach.<br/><br/><h3>URBO AWAITS YOU ANYTIME</h3><br/>Take your mind off work for a quarter of an hour or spend an entire evening playing the game. Run it while waiting for guests or during a break from your favorite activities. Take a moment to pause if you're feeling stressed. Shift your attention when you realize you can't solve an important problem. Who knows, maybe it's URBO that holds the key to it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-15T04:41:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a446e8d6f3dfc7173f3c15c82f0251f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 29, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Door 407"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Door 407"], "esrb_rating": null}
