Beware, you have limited time to move to it and some obstacles appear on level. The <br/>goal is to complete as many orders as possible in given time.<br/></p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>This is my entry for TriJam #84 and my first attemp at making game in 3 hours. I had a lot of fun designing game mechanic on paper and implementing it in Godot and GDScript. Development went well.
