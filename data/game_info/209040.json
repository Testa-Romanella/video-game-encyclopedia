I made this game in a day, give or take a few hours due to sleep and procrastination, so it is bound to contain a few bugs; hopefully not too many!! This is my first completed game, as well. Either way, I hope it's enjoyable!</p>\n<p>It is basically the story of <em>Totti</em>, a boy who, due to circumstances, ended up in an orphanage. The objective is to, well, do stuff to escape from the orphanage, while you learn more about this boy. <em>It's rather text-ridden, and includes three endings, so please check them out!</em></p>\n<p>Warning for (PG-13) underage sexuality, disaster, tragedy, pain and suffering. So rad.</p>\n<p>(Freeware SFX from FlashKit.com; Everything else was made by me. Sorry if it's lacking in the sound department.)</p>\n<p>Thanks for the attention; Bug reports and (useful) criticism are very welcome as well!<br/>Have a nice day~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae27a9105bcf54416b760e1b176a7e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lychee Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
