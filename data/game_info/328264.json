You venture from your home and attempt the challenge. You have plenty of choices to make if you hope to succeed in climbing the tower. But, be careful. Make the wrong choice and you may not make it back home.\u00a0Do you have what it takes to make it to the top?</p>\n<p>This game was made in about 5-6 days for \"HawkSandwich's Surreal Jam\" : https://itch.io/jam/hawksandwich-surreal-jam. The story is rushed and preachy but, overall, I'm happy with the result.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/530/53084f0d27c6f614ae4ee06c499eaf42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["K-Chaz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
