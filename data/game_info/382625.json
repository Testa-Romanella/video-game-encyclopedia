But perhaps by digging a little, you might find something.</p>\n<p>This is a God game created for Ludum Dare 45:\u00a0Start with nothing.</p>\n<ul><li>ARROWS to move</li><li>SPACE to dig and examine.</li><li>TAB to leave, enter spaceship.</li><li>H for help</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong>:</p>\n<p>Grow your world until you reach 1000 humans.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dev notes:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This game was a real torture to make!</p>\n<p>So I came up with this brilliant idea. How about instead of programming the AI, I just let players do it themselves? Cause really, I really suck and programming AI and I didn't feel like it. So I came up with this convoluted dialog system to setup AI, and it was even more difficult than making the AI itself. Plus for testing, I did have to come up with semi descent AI, using my convoluted system.</p>\n<p>Anyway, halfway through, I was thinking let's just ditch that idea... then I changed my mind and left it in there.</p>\n<p>So there you go. A game halfway done, missing all the AI, but you as a player get to fill in the blank. I did manage to multiply my rabbit population, then gave up afterwards cause it was too complicated. So if you do manage to reach the two last achievements, please do let me know cause I haven't even got to that point yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:50:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b5/1b593b0cf87e937c91ba6f936803cff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Le Hamster"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
