Sequel to &#39;Mamegoma: Honobono Nikki&#39; and second of four total DS titles, it was released on July 31st, 2008 in Japan. It is based on a seal toy brand of the same name (&#39;Mamegoma&#39;), which is managed by San-X.</h2>\n<p>For the first time ever, experience the rapture of the original pet seal simulator: through the lens of a three-dimensional (3D) world! With a bundle of brand new surprises, tag along with your previous favourite seal pups, plus 10 additional breeds, as you focus on nurturing them to maturity.</p>\n<p>Unlike its first game, you may bunker down with over three pet seals at a time, for as long as you want- no restrictions tied! Try to figure out each individual seal&#39;s preferred food, and continue to help them grow with activities such as cleaning the tank, playtime with minigames, outdoor trips, and much more. Once two seals have reached adulthood, you may even be able to breed them for different outcomes via local communication.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-18T01:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dc/3dc60ef3ec97f1574423fd5ebdca5cdf.jpg", "website": "http://www.san-x.jp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Creative Core Co."], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
