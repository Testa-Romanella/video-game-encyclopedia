{"id": 847420, "slug": "carnation-girls", "name": "Carnation girls", "name_original": "Carnation girls", "description": "<p>You're a detective who has been hired to solve the murder of the young heiress of the wealthy Carnation family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, your job is inhibited by your fear of blood. But that's what Alvie is for. You are here to talk to the suspects\u00a0and gain context, she will investigate the body.</p>\n<p>You spend your days talking to the people of the household, often with the main three suspects, the deceased heiress's younger sisters:\u00a0Mara, Marsha and\u00a0May.</p>\n<p>Will you manage to stay detached and professional? Or will you allow yourself to get attached and befriend the people you are meant to be investigating?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Notes:<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0This is an early release version with only an early version of the prologue, so please keep that in mind when playing the game.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0The demo\u00a0allows for you to use she/her, he/him or they/them pronouns. With a male, female or non-binary protagonist.</p>\n<p>- Concepts may change as development continues.\u00a0I cannot promise a release time, since I cannot predict how busy I will be in the future.</p>\n<p>Concept:</p>\n<p>I intend for there to be two chapters in the final game, and the chapter 2 will differ depending on who you talk to each day in chapter 1. Chapter 1 will take place over 7 days, and depending on who you talk to the game will either put you on Mara's route, Marsha's route, May's route or the investigation route.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The investigation route will involve talking to various characters around the mansion other than the main three girls, such as the maids, the butlers, the chefs, the lord and lady, and Amias.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girls routes will also not necessarily be romantic, depending on your options, as solving the case is top priority. You could opt to stay professional and just investigate them as a possible suspect or befriend them platonically.</p>\n<p>Things may change during production but that's the idea right now.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Sound effects from freesound.org:\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0soneproject: fairy1;\u00a0hinzebeat: plate-with-cutlery;\u00a0rui-aires: writing-pen</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0giordanofabricio: galloping-horse-caballo-galopando;\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0yaboiboimane: relaxing-garden-sounds; liftpizzas: scratch-1x</p>\n<p>Music made in Acid pro.</p>\n<p>Game made in ren'py.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T14:53:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51d/51d409379b6320408ea9a640b9c77261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Orchida"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
