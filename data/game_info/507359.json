But you have to try anyway, right?   </p>\n<p>Take My Breath Away is a visual novel with dating sim elements. Message your bachelor (or bachelorette, planned for the complete release) and invite them on a date! If it goes well, maybe you can take things somewhere more private. If it goes badly, well\u2026 let\u2019s just hope it doesn\u2019t.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is only a demo! Play time is around 10-ish minutes. Everything in this demo is subject to change (particularly the graphics, since there are some backgrounds and CGs missing). If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for changes, please feel free to let me know! My current plans for the complete version include 4 routes, each around 10 minutes long, plus a True Ending route.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Content warning: This is a horror game. Please don\u2019t play if you\u2019re sensitive to (PG-13 level) depictions of violence.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa046ebe68eb70a61b62a08bf03e4ae7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mirlambda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
