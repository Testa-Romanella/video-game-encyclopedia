Let's pass those useless cards to other players!<br/><br/>The first player who uses up all the hand wins!<br/><br/><strong>[Game Modes]</strong><br/>There are two types of decks: the \"Casual Deck\" with fewer card types &amp; simpler effects, and the \"Standard Deck\" with more card types &amp; more strategic effects.<br/>I recommend you to play \"Casual\" at first, and when you get used to it, try the \"Standard\"!<br/>Changing decks will greatly change the game strategy!<br/><br/>And there are also two types of score limit: \"One Round\" and \"100 Points\".<br/><br/><strong>[Online Match]</strong><br/>You can play with players from all over the world, and make private match by using password.<br/>You can also add NPCs to fill match!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T02:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c57825ff54d9564e5e18c3056f8a383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aineko Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aineko Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
