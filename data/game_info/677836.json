Fired shells will only hit objects which are in the tanks field of vision at the time the shell is fired. Each tank scores points by shooting the other tank or shooting one of the opposition\u2019s buildings. At the end of the game the tank with the highest points wins. The game ends when both tanks have run out of ammunition or when either player\u2019s buildings have been entirely destroyed.
