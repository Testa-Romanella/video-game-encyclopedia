The models look a LOT more realistic with a boy as PAC-Man, a Mobster as Blinky, and a chocolate bar collectable. Not just the models, but also the pick-up mechanics have a twist, because the chocolate will wait for 10 seconds at its location, once 10 seconds has passed since spawn, the chocolate will respawn\u00a0to another random location.\u00a0The objective of the game is to collect a total of 8 chocolates, while trying to avoid running into the enemy mobster, who will follow and hurt you. Once you collect a total of 8 chocolates, you win.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T16:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dc74241bfda02739dbc30d8c2a2eec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["B4tP3n9uin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
