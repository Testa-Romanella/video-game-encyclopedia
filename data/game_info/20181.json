Don\u2019t worry, though. They don\u2019t glitter!<br/><br/><strong>Do YOU think you have what it takes to bring them home?</strong><br/><br/>\u201cIf Tim Burton made a PC strategy game, this would be it. Vampires is a great addictive title from CBE Software, the guys who brought you Ghost in the Sheet and J.U.L.I.A.\u201d<br/><br/>True PC Gaming<br/><br/>Vampires: Guide Them to Safety! is an offbeat <strong>action puzzle</strong> game, filled with vampires, traps, crazy Transylvanian music and fun.<br/><br/>In short, it\u2019s a comedy puzzler where non-glittering bobbleheaded ignorants meet reversed tower defense. Vampires! are a genre mix where strategy, puzzle and action meet fun and frustration. The goal of the game is to guide those bobbleheads through labyrinth and into their crypts while avoiding obstacles, traps and vampire hunters on the way.<br/><br/>It\u2019s almost dawn and vampires are returning into their coffins for a well-deserved sleep after a long night. Time is ticking until the dawn and they\u2019ve discovered that a bunch of vampire slayers got there first and set up traps! Now it\u2019s up to you to use your supernatural powers of tile rotation, garlic-based repellent and spider net slow-down, to help them overcome all obstacles and reach their regular daily rest.<br/><br/><strong>How does the game play?</strong><br/><br/>Your main objective is to save vampires by leading them safely through the labyrinth and into their crypts. To do so, you can rotate the labyrinth parts to create new paths or use garlic-based repellent and spider-net slowdown to prevent vampires from walking into peril. Many traps are indeed lurking for the poor vampires. Starting with simple ones like pure light, things get more complicated down the road. Mobile wooden stakes, silver gun bullets, hired assassins or crazy garlic sappers wait impatiently to vaporize your vampires once for all.<br/>Do you think you\u2019ve mastered the game already?
