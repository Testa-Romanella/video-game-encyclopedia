{"id": 734651, "slug": "jenkas-nightmare", "name": "Jenka's Nightmare", "name_original": "Jenka's Nightmare", "description": "<p>Jenka&#39;s Nightmare is a fan-made sequel to the popular indie game Cave Story created by Mark &quot;shmitz&quot; Major in 2009. The game was made up to approximately 75% completion then abandoned, only to be picked up over a year later by LunarSoul aka MagicDoors and completed in 2011. The game is a direct sequel to the original, and picks up immediately from Cave Story&#39;s Secret Ending; thus Spoilers abound.</p>\n<p>Quote, Curly, and Balrog have spent a short time enjoying their new lives away from The Island after the events of the previous story, the defeat of The Doctor and Ballos. Suddenly and without warning, they are transported back to the island and separated. The only clue as to the reason for this is Quote being teleported into Jenka&#39;s house; the old witch is lying on the ground in pain, and says only &quot;Help me&quot; before Quote is cast back into the same cave in which Cave Story began... Or is it? The entire island has been changed, and two forces - Genesis and Oblivion - are running rampant. It&#39;s up to Quote to find out what they&#39;re doing, what&#39;s happened to Jenka, and how it can all be fixed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T19:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a1/6a1917a1b029f3c3ba1a207b9caa2d91.jpg", "website": "http://www.jenkasnightmare.srb2.org/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 411, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
