Blocks can't pass another block, or the trail of a moving block. <br/><br/>Built using UE4.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d236cfe24fdcd58b7fe3325387cc1dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gameXcore"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
