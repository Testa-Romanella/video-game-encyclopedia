This is my first jam game so feel free to leave a comment. Control of the Crypt is a turn based dungeon crawler where your controls are your health. Use potions to restore your health or use a turn to switch what key is disabled. The bow is a ranged weapon you can use to defeat enemies from a safe distance. Be careful though, if you pick up a new item you lose whatever you were carrying, so if you have a key, don't lose it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d18d73b5a26bf8e5be7ff5fd136ad60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nushiva"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
