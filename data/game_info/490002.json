Keep your wits about you as hordes of goblins, fire elementals, and ogrillas try to take you down. This demo is to provide a simple environment to play around with the mechanics, as the full project would contain four-player co-op, longer linear levels, and a legion of unique Shard Hunters to enlist for the common cause;\u00a0leaping\u00a0across time and space to reverse the annihilation of your realm. And gold. Gold is good, too.</p>\n<p>To be made some day; though due to lack of time and resources, as well as a desire to pursue back burner projects, development will pause after this release.\u00a0But for now, enjoy a simpler game where you steal a slab of meat from a goblin encampment, and the chaos ensues.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:15:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e156254597dbc48b6c7d1ab4058ec54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Potion Park"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
