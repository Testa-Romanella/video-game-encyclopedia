If you're setting up an actual Escape Room, Clue Vault is for you! \u00a0<br/><br/>** If you are not setting up a real world Escape Room, or do not know what one is, ClueVault will not likely be of any use to you! **<br/><br/>As part of your Escape Room, ClueVault turns your device into a locked vault.  You will need to set up the puzzles that will lead to the passcode needed to unlock the vault.  When your participants solve your puzzles and deduce the passcode you've chosen, the vault will open and they will see the message you've stored inside.  Your vault can contain a clue that helps solve another puzzle, or a message to inform the participants that they have escaped successfully.   <br/><br/>Your vault can contain a text message, image, or video.<br/><br/>Use Guided Access to ensure that your device is locked into Clue Vault, so participants will not be able to exit the app.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T10:18:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/401/4012903ea4c35f7d4df62e76246e4410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Michael Rogoff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Michael Rogoff"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
