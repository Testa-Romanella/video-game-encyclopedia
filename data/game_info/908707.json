But going and harvesting each soul individually is too slow, so the reaper lets them group up by type, creating the 7 bosses.</p>\n<p>You can grow your garden to get upgrades for later bosses. Each plant has its own soul cost, use, and growth time measured in the stage.</p>\n<p>Grow your garden and harvest the souls of the dead.</p>\n<p>------------------------</p>\n<p>The game is very not complete : )<br/>2 out of the 7 bosses are not functionally implemented and there is no win screen. Plus other problems and sprite issues.
