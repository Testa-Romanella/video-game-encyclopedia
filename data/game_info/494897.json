There are seven Skins remastered from the Monsterhearts 1st\u00a0edition product Skins for the Skinless and three new Skins which are ready to be brought into your games of urban fantasy.</p>\n<p>The Skins in this product are:</p>\n<p><strong>The Angel</strong>\u00a0<em>Hopeful, giving, and deluded. The Angel is the kid that who has been sworn to something they don't fully understand.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Calaca</strong>\u00a0<em>Optimistic, perceptive, and invasive. Not everyone fears death and not everyone who has died really cares that much.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Fury</strong>\u00a0<em>Introverted, skittish, and naive. All that the Fury wants is to have a friend or maybe a lover.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Jorogumo</strong>\u00a0<em>Calculating, manipulative, brazen, and clingy. The Jorogumo is about knowing what you want and going for it however you best see fit.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Minotaur</strong>\u00a0<em>Angry, scary, forceful, and hurt. The Minotaur is a bully that wants desperately to be accepted even though it seems like all they\u2019re good at is hurting people.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Mummy</strong>\u00a0<em>Regal, controlling, empowered, and short-sighted. The Mummy is a person who knows they can demand the finest of the fine and get it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Muse</strong>\u00a0<em>Talented, inspired, and cloying. The Muse demands attention while being unable to take the spotlight for themselves.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Proxy</strong>\u00a0<em>Observant, possessive, paranoid, and stalked. It\u2019s all coming down upon the Proxy and to survive it may mean sacrificing others.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Unseen</strong>\u00a0<em>Overlooked, watchful, needy, and seething. The Unseen is ignored and forgotten more than they are actively excluded; always an afterthought, just on the outskirts of everything.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Wyvern</strong>\u00a0<em>Frustrated, determined, sublime, and often misunderstood. The Wyvern is a novelty to others but not to themselves \u2014 they would be perfectly comfortable in their own skin if others would only stop commenting on it.</em></p>\n<p>Thanks to Topher Gerkey's kindness I was allowed to put my own spin on these Skins and am very pleased with the outcome. The Angel is distinct and not connected to the Angel from Monsterhearts 1st edition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slip on these Skins and bring some mayhem to your table!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:16:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12e/12eef38abf4737f436348a9cfc3e18ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ferretheim Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
