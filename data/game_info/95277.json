You wander the forest, breathe in the damp air. Eternal rain leaving puddles. You light a fire under a ledge to stay warm. In your pocket is a damp note you found in the mud. \"Remember The Sound Of Now - \u0394\" You tightly grip the handle of your umbrella as you toss the note into the fire. It turns to ash and its fragments rise into the air. The path calls you back.</p>In the woodsI waited4414In the darkI dreamed3124By the fireI remembered7777<p>Download the Original Soundtrack here: https://blueskybleu.bandcamp.com/album/petrichor-o...<br/>An epilogue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17e/17e38e6dea181d1a147e977983182f5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sundae Month"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
