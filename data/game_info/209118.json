Click to play.</p>\n<p>This is a little game I made where you must destroy the incoming projectiles to save the chubby space man on his way home! It was the third in a series of 5 'games' created for my semester one, year one studies at RMIT university. \u00a0Unfortunately, this game can only be played in the browser and with a computer. Please don't download it and modify the files, or post as your own. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>I may come back to this in the future and add small visual tweaks, some pacing and difficulty tweaks, and possibly (if like more than 5 people are interested) a whole new game mode (endless).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, there's a very brief cameo from some popular cartoon characters in this. I claim no ownership of them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8d8e9061b618a18a7cbfd1542ed650.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
