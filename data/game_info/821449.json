Solve puzzles and advance to the next stage. Definitely more I could do with it and I have more ideas for it, but again, 2 day jam. Had to keep the scope in check.\u00a0Even with that scope there's 10 levels, and a 'more RNG' mode, so I feel like that's pretty good for a 2 day Jam.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrows to Move</li><li>ESC to open Menu<br/>\n</li><li>Mouse to Click Buttons</li><li>R to reload level without needing to open menu</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Noteworthy Bugs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>For some reason, the WebGL build just stops playing music around the 7th level. The Windows build is perfectly fine, it's just the WebGL build and I have no idea why.\u00a0 So, I guess the Windows version is the better option for sound, but the WebGL one is still the easiest to play.</li><li>The way the randomization works, it can sometimes make the level actually impossible. I probably could've tried to fix it, but 2 day scope, so there's an option to reload the level and reroll the numbers which should fix it eventually.</li></ul>\n\n<p>(Holy shit, it's been almost a year since I've done anything. God it feels good to be back and\u00a0do game design stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, Why did I make a puzzle game, I'm not a smart person)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:44:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24d/24d8986546ae13d3cb755043bfb1fa16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Duck In A Top Hat Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
