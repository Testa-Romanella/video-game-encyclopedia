With winter fast approaching, you had no choice but to consult a loan shark to lend you the money to buy a temporary apartment. You hoped that you'd've been able to find a new job to help meet your deadline in time, but despite how hard you worked, you were not able\u00a0\u00a0to pay him back in time. Now, he's angry, <em>and the bulky phone on your table seems to be ringing...</em></p>\n<p>-<em>You'll need to acquire all three other endings before you unlock ending 4.</em></p>\n<p>-<em>As of now, this game does not have a saving feature, so if you close the game and come back on, your progress should reset.
