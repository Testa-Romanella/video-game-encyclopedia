Yes, you are not the hero in this story, neither are you the right guy. but you will be doing it anyway!<br/>This game is really silly, but loads of fun and has loads of Easter eggs, You play as you, a loser, you are the wrong guy for the job but a giant squid God has forced you onto an adventure which will leave you going 'Huh?' the whole way through! <br/><br/>Throw rocks. blow stuff up with grenades! even shoot lasers and lock on plasma bolts as you gain abilities the further on you play. Each zone has a end boss waiting for you too!<br/><br/>The controls are that of your typical platformer, jump, double jump, wall jump, shoot lasers!<h3>An awesome adventure awaits!</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T04:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d24/d24b5eb631edf28da238938fcecb7253.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StarSystemStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["StarSystemStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
