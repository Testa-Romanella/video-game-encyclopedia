Its main idea is the transfer of the participant\u2019s body into a virtual body and then a simulation of that presence in said body. The main emphasis of the action is motion-captured intercourse between real people which builds up the experience. The creators identify the idea of acquiring the body and taking over another being with Tulpa, present in Tibetan mysticism, sometimes used as a synonym for \u201cmagical vanity\u201d, \u201capparition\u201d or \u201cthought-shape\u201d.<br/></p>\n<p>The concept behind the script for the experience is derived from the interest in early film adaptations of SF cinema. They represented VR at the time and the transhumanist idea of feelings being virtually connected between two people alongside body structure studies and a possibility of expressing its motor skills through specific aesthetics. The project is a response to a current health situation \u2013 the limitation of interpersonal contacts caused by the pandemic and, as a result, causing social contacts to be shadowed in virtual space.\r\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit, Windows 11 64-bit</p>\n<p>Supported headsets: HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, Oculus Quest via cable link, Valve Index</p>\n<p>Room size requirements : minimal required is 2 meters by 2 meters</p>\n<p>The user should try to manipulate the virtual bodies with his hands to interact with them\u00a0through sounds and visuals.</p>\n<p>Shortcuts:</p>\n<p>SPACE - start the experience</p>\n<p>R - restart experience (hold for 5 seconds)</p>\n<p>P - pause</p>\n<p>C - re-center</p>\n<p>ESC - exit the application</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T06:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c345e9fa248f42a391b17729f95bafc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["INEXSISTENS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
