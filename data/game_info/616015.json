Surprisingly, she did not get hurt when reaching the bottom, and because of the darkness surrounding her she could not really understand why. Fortunately, her homemade bracelet hookshot was still intact, and so she decides to not give up and tries to find a way out of the well by climbing back up.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 When climbing up the girl scout will find her lost items, and will be able to use them to her vantage. Sometimes, things will seem out of this world: platforms move, flowers grow inside the well, there\u2019s giant gelatin platforms and gates. The girl scout will start having hallucinations and see things that are not quite real, perhaps from all the stress of being alone and the claustrophobia caused by the tight space inside the well.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Your hookshot is the core mechanic, meaning you'll use it throughout the whole game.
