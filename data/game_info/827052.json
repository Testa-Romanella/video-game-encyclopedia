Every forward move you gain 1 clog. Every 20 clogs you lose 1 luck. Less luck is more reds. More luck is less reds (approx.).

Yet it's a prototype of a turn-based runner. So i'd like to see feedback about the idea. The character's based on an idea of the friends of mine. We had plans to make an NFT collection with this character. I still think it could be a real deal to implement some web3.0 to the game later and release the collection to fund the game development if the prototype would gather positive reviews.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>=Tech=</strong></p>\n<p>Build for Windows</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T08:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df7a13856b17627d9a5b3da96fb5b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["groosha"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
