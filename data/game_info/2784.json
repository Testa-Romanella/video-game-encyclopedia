The difficulty, the challenge and at the same time the solution is that the levels are designed in the world of drawings by M. C. Escher. Top, bottom, right, left, floor, ceiling, stairs and walls are not in their usual places, not fixed and pass into each other quite differently than in the real world. However, the solution is sought precisely by turning over, rotating and other unusual, impossible actions with all this.</p>\n<p>48 puzzles await the hero throughout the game. Each puzzle has its own unique solution.</p>\n<p>After the hero passes the main story of the game, its alternative version will open. Alternative version includes alternative versions of half of the puzzles, 24 pieces. And, accordingly, 24 variants of the end of the game.<br />\nDuring the game, you can step back and change the decision - so you can not be upset if an error has been committed.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2013-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-04T16:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a3/5a36930b16d9b1949d8c8c92b5a28d89.jpg", "website": "http://TheBridgeIsBlackAndWhite.com", "rating": 3.27, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 220, "owned": 2025, "beaten": 91, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 128, "playing": 10}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 120, "ratings_count": 253, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 254, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "PS Vita", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3", "Wii U", "macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild", "Ty Taylor and Mario Casta\u00f1eda", "Ty Taylor and Mario Castaneda"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Midnight City", "The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild"], "esrb_rating": null}
