Along the way, several randomly selected encounters will occur. Make decisions, use items, battle enemies, and befriend frogs in order to survive. Make it all the way to Newtopia in one piece to win.\r\n  </p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t want to play as joke characters, you can instead play through the whole game as Anne in a totally not rushed bonus mode. Featuring some custom dialogue, a unique intro, and two unique endings ripped right from the show. Just press \u201cb\u201d at the character select screen to start her journey. (B for Boonchuy)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Features:<br/>- 5 playable characters each with their own starting items<br/>- 85+ randomly generated encounters including a few familiar faces<br/>- 40+ different enemies to fight<br/>- 45+ items to help along the way<br/>- 10 different endings<br/>- 13 music tracks, including a bunch of Amphibia remixes<br/>- Minigames! <br/></p>\n<p>Thanks again to laserlizard0, Barry, Astro Sleep,  Tsuwami, VulpsVulps, Lenty AV, M:AM, Karu, pekano, AmphibiaMedia, Goblino,\u00a0Money Burger, fruityboyjr,\u00a0RaspberryPiNews, and everyone else who helped make this project possible.
