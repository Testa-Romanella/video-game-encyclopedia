Make your way through the memories of a young man who's been running away from his past.</p>\n<p><em>Take your time and enjoy the journey.</em><br/><br/><br/><em>Remember past events.</em><br/><br/><br/><em>Remember everything...</em><br/><br/>Companion story, Faded Grey, available for free here.<br/><br/><strong>Note from the developer:</strong><br/><br/>For most of my adult life I have struggled to deal with the difficult experiences from my childhood, and it made it very hard to accept and love myself. I've only recently figured out what I need to let go of. Through a journey of self discovery and being able to make this game I can say that I\u2019m now the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.<br/><br/>Gate to Site 8 was made with the intent that others who have had similar experiences, and struggled to find their purpose afterwards, can reflect on their past and think about what effect those traumas still have today.<br/><br/>For me, it was realizing that the thing I wanted most was unachievable. Although I got what I thought I wanted from many people, the reason I wasn\u2019t happy is because I only ever wanted it from one person. That physical person is still alive, but the person they used to be no longer exists. Being able to understand where my feelings came from has made it easier to accept, forgive, and move on.<br/><br/>Though Gate to Site 8 is somewhat dark and metaphorical, I hope it helps you in some way. I hope you can find a reason for why you feel the way you do and that it gets easier to live a happier, healthier life.<br/><br/><em>I love you, and I forgive you...</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-13T05:41:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4c2506e4fc1a01fd4eb8460e0bd39d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Derek Golliher \u2022 Orange Crow Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
