{"id": 909224, "slug": "hex-yield", "name": "Hex-Yield", "name_original": "Hex-Yield", "description": "<p>Hex-Yield is a chill puzzle game about building the world of your imagination on a small hexagonal grid. Each tile you place influences the tiles around it, so by combining different tiles you can get some interesting results. But every now and then you have to reset your world and gain the potential of what you have created, to then go ahead and create something even better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Manipulate tiles to create a world with a lot of potential. Once you are happy with your world you can harvest this potential and start over, but you can invest the harvested potential to create more complex tiles. Different combinations of tiles will also generate more potential. Some combinations might be a bit tricky to find. Once you fill up your progress you will gain extra tiles to work with.</p>\n<p>There is no win state, but you can try to find all the different tiles there are by combining all kinds of tiles. Or you can try to reach the maximum map size by filling up the progress bar.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong></p>\n<p>The potential you have left when harvesting your world is lost, so make sure to spend as much of it as possible. (Unless you activate Chill Mode in the options)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>\u00a0 <br/>Left Mouse Button - Click and Interact</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Cancel Selection and Hold to Move</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel - Zoom<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A game by - @AndideBob\r\n    </p>\n<p>Graphics by - @Rincs\r\n    </p>\n<p>Music by - WhistlingForest\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T17:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/57206ea5abf60d32eb0109f0cb728ca7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["andidebob", "Rincs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
