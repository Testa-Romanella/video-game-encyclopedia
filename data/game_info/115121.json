Use physics based obstacles to enable you to reach places that would be inaccessible to most frogs while collecting frog coins on the way. All music used in the game is original.</p><p>This is just a demo of a full release that I am working on and only contains about 10-30 minutes of gameplay. I am well aware this demo is very rough around the edges but I wanted to give people the chance to take a look and see what they think so all feedback is welcome! </p><p>I hope you enjoy the demo and if you do you can follow my twitter @GurowichGameDev for updates on the game's full release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46c/46ce982af8b2bdb6084f1fcf0078046a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SharkDaPus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
