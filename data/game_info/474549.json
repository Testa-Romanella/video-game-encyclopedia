I will be uploading a version with an accessibility option sometime in the next couple of days. Sorry!)</p>\n<p>Turns out, hell is circles... Just circles all the way down. Free the spirits of the unquiet dead (by shooting them with your circular gun) and maybe escape from this geometric oblivion!</p>\n<p>A very minimalist arena shooter/bullet hell made for Portland Indie Game Squad's 2020 Summer Slow Jam: Ghost Notes. I will fully admit here and now that I didn't follow the music-first technical theme, as I started late after getting the itch to code something, and am not much of musician myself. That said, I wrote music! For this game! And the premise (and the synth I used in GarageBand) DOES fit the theme!</p>\n<p>Right now, there is only one level, but it's playable through multiple waves with somewhat increasing difficulty!</p>\n<p>To launch: Run CircleOfBulletHell.exe</p>\n<p>To play: Shoot demons! Collect ghosts! Don't get hit (more than 5 times)!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>Mouse - Aim<br/>Mouse1/F - Shoot<br/>Q - Switch Weapons<br/>U - Open Upgrade Menu<br/>1-9 - Purchase Upgrades<br/>Esc - Menu/Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cfa50657c255bdaab4bc03dc9019585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pyrphorosgames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
