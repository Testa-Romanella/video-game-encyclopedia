Throw your dice, build your own path, defeat the orks on your way and get to the end of the tunnel!\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls are explained in the main menu of the game. You can also open the tutorial anytime with\u00a0H.\r\n</p>\r\nTools\r\n<p>Engine:\u00a0Unity\r\n</p>\n<p>Graphics:\u00a0Gimp\r\n</p>\n<p>Music/Sound design:\u00a0Reaper, my mic, my guitar and too much reverb\r\n</p>\n<p>Font:\u00a0Yoster Island\r\n</p>\r\nFeelings\r\n<p>It took me some time to find an idea that I like. I first thought I would go for yet another platformer. I finally came with an idea that takes some inspirations from\u00a0Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeondice Monsters\u00a0and\u00a0Loop Hero. I really love the concept and hope to build something bigger with that idea in the future.\r\n</p>\n<p>Trying to go minimalistic for the graphics was real fun. It made me feel weird not to use the animation tool during this jam x)\r\n</p>\r\nHope you enjoy the game, have fun!\r\nScreenshots", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:43:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15d/15dbf40893d6b64467d93a6ce1344a5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Solah"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
