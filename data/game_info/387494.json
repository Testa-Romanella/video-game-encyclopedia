You'll have to survive on an island prison but you won't be able to do so alone. You'll have to earn the favor of the other residents as you search for a way to escape.</p>\n<p>This game is very early access and has very little content at the moment. Most of which is place holder and subject to change. As such I do recommend that you don't donate to this project yet unless you're highly confident in it, which is hugely appreciate but not adviced at this stage of development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:54:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/524/524876a6473aab32f0019a35d53160a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Draite"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
