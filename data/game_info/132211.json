If I discover how to make something work in Twine, I'll put a result here. These are not finished games, but rather proof-of-concept. You can check them out and wonder how much easier it would have been to make something like that work if the creator was actually able to code and use something other than Twine.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Test_Labyrinth</strong>:\u00a0 I wanted to make a randomized labyrinth in Twine. It's five by five rooms, you start in the North Western corner and the exit is in the South Eastern corner.\u00a0You need\u00a0to find two keys,\u00a0which are\u00a0placed\u00a0in random rooms, to open the exit\u00a0door.\u00a0This may one day\u00a0develop in an entire\u00a0little\u00a0roguelike\u00a0made in Twine. We\u00a0will see. Cool\u00a0features\u00a0of this\u00a0project (considering it's made in Twine):<br/>Randomized labyrinth. Game tracks your position in order to get you back to where you were from inventory-interactions. Keys can be anywhere!</p>\n<p><strong>Test_Goblinpuncher</strong>: My attempt at creating a somewhat randomized fighting system with Twine. Fight a bar full of goblins, one after the other, until you go down. How many can you beat up? This may one day become the base for a fighting system in a more serious game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b723f0a44d3a615287a26576ac6501e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadZab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
