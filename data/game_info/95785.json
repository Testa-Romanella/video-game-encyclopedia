Finished game will be available later...\r\n<p>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe year is 2066 and this years battle of the bands has finally arrived. It's time for you to prove yourself to you and your peers by partaking in combat. <strong><em> Spherakill </em></strong> is a local-multiplayer arena based first person shooter/brawler.The thing is you aren't actually making contact with each other through normal means, but through a sphere shaped barrier which you must roll into your opponents to send them flying out of bounds.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe goal is simple, knock your opponents off the stage and rack up as many knockouts as you can before the timer stops. Think you have what it takes to take home the battle of the bands championship belt?! We'll see soon enough. The weapons help support you but nobody actually dies, despite what the name actually implies. Maybe they used to, long ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tUp to 4 player local-multiplayer action\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tvivid arenas packed with imagination\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tLarge colorful cast of playable characters\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMultiple game modes <em>(to be revealed at a later date)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIntense fast paced punk soundtrack\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNon violent (technically) fun for all ages!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSpherakill's musical emphasis is very much in the realm of high energy punk. We plan on getting a large diversified list of bands to help bring the game and its various battlefields to life. Our team has eyes on several bands for the future.
