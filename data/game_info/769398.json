He began his journey painting after dealing with years of mental health struggles, and now spends his time sharing the power of art with folks who are just starting out, or others who have been at it for quite some time.  His ability to share his stories, as well as the good he's brought to his community and the community as a whole was our inspiration to work with him in creating this one of a kind experience.  With his help, we hope to fine tune this experience to bring you the most accurate painting simulator possible.  You may even get a visit from him while your painting!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T03:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c12/c129315317a7d9e932c58b9e8a689a16.jpg", "website": "http://www.m00fins.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chriton Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Chriton Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
