It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man X series of video games that originated on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Mega Man Xtreme takes place within the series timeline, during the 22nd century, in which a group of &quot;Maverick&quot; androids called the &quot;Shadow Hunters&quot; hack into the world&#39;s &quot;Mother Computer&quot; system, destabilize all of the networks, and allow other Mavericks to cause rampant destruction all over the world. The heroic &quot;Maverick Hunter&quot; Mega Man X is tasked with going into cyberspace to relive his past missions and put a stop to the group&#39;s plans.<br />\nMega Man Xtreme contains the same gameplay as its home console counterparts. An action-platform game, the player must attempt a series of stages, gain various power-ups such as armor parts, and defeat each stage&#39;s boss, assimilating its signature weapon. The game features stages, enemies, and bosses from both Mega Man X and Mega Man X2 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Mega Man Xtreme was met with a lightly positive critical response. Reviewers enjoyed its familiar gameplay, but were disappointed by graphical issues and a high difficulty level. The game was followed by one direct sequel, Mega Man Xtreme 2, also for the Game Boy Color. In 2013, Mega Man Xtreme was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan&#39;s Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShop the following year.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-27T12:13:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b34/b34e4e372f98bb41cbe44b5b5797dc45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.33, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 6, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 256, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["Game Boy Color"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
