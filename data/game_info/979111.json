{"id": 979111, "slug": "sword-vs-horde", "name": "Sword vs Horde", "name_original": "Sword vs Horde", "description": "<ul><li> Melee based horde survival<br/></li><li> Swing your blade in circles, either clockwise or counterclockwise<br/></li><li> Weapons have momentum and can bounce off obstacles<br/></li><li> Unique dizziness mechanic to keep you on your toes</li></ul><br/><h3>Dizzying Sword-spinning Combat</h3><br/>You sweep your blade around in a large circle, getting faster and faster, but if you spin in the same direction for too long, you'll start to get dizzy and eventually lose your sense of direction, leaving you open to enemy attacks. Better start spinning your blade the other way before that happens. You must find the right moment to do so.<br/>Your footwork is important, too! Your movement will influence that of your blade and vice-versa, opening up a higher skill-ceiling. Positioning, quick decision-making and environmental awareness are key to surviving the endless onslaught.<h3>Wave Based Horde Survival</h3><br/>Eight enemy types with different abilities and behaviour patterns will come at you in huge waves with dozens or even hundreds of enemies on screen at once. Each successive wave will have a different composition of enemy types and increased levels of challenge. Make it further and further to beat your highscore!<h3>Quick and Satisfying Action</h3><br/>The game lets you get right into the satisfying experience of seeing your defeated enemies burst into a cloud of pixels. A typical run lasts only a couple of minutes, getting longer the better you play. Perfect for a quick play session in-between, or a longer one trying to up your game and beat your highscore.<br/><br/><h3>Historical Weapons and Armor to Unlock</h3><br/>By surviving for longer and longer each attempt and defeating hundreds or thousands of monsters, you will earn points that you can spend to unlock a variety of weapons and armor for future runs. Each piece of equipment has different looks and stats that change the way you play. There are currently 7 weapons and 5 sets of armor in the game.<br/>Most weapons and armor in the game are based on actual historical ones, so their descriptions include a brief overview of the historical context.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-29T08:21:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f73/f73676d9927cd82dfeb997b1dec55094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Zimmerbyte Games Lukas B.
