It was released in 1993 by Team17 for the Amiga, available in both OCS/ECS and AGA versions. This is the first title that Team17 had developed to take advantage of Commodore's then new AGA Chipset.</p>\n<p>The AGA version of the game was also included as an extra in the Amiga CD32 version of Alien Breed: Tower Assault.</p>\n<p>The game engine for Alien Breed II was largely rewritten to allow smoother scrolling between screens (the code for which was carried over to another Team17 project, Superfrog, a 2D platformer game). The graphics were also vastly improved, as were the size and number of levels (there are 17 in AB-II compared to 6 in Alien Breed and 12 in Alien Breed Special Edition 92). The difficulty curve for AB-II is also steeper than that of its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Alien Breed II is the only game in the series that gives players the option of choosing between four characters, each with their own specific strengths and weaknesses.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1993-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318a0ca996990e4fafcf5152f31841a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 291, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Team17 Digital"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Team17 Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
