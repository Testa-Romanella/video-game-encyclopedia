Using the accelerometer, Traceur tracks your movements and, once calibrated, will let you navigate an endless runner style gauntlet by jogging, dodging in place, and jumping.</p><p>Traceur was developed as a collaboration between students in an advanced Game Design class, and students in a Game Programming class, over the span of two and a half months. It is, as of May 12, still a prototype, and feedback is more than welcome, and actively encouraged.</p><p>As the game has been developed for the Gear VR, users must follow a set of instructions in order to play Traceur. For now, this process is most easily accessible by GearVR developers. Regular users can still follow these instructions if they wish.</p><p>1.
