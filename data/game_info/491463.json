Uses assets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGlitchy Apocalypse Simulator is a comical physics-based game.  It uses the amazing Puppet Master asset, but is left unmodified for comical effects.  The game is a light-hearted, comical sandbox and makes no attempts at realism or strategy.  Many effects may be considered bugs, but some effort was made to filter out annoying bugs and only leave in comical bugs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe make no claims on producing everything in this game.  Many of the great things in this game are available for general use on the Unity store and we encourage using Glitchy Apocalypse Simulator as a stepping stone for your own creativity.  We did, however, write the software that ties everything together.  That is the reason for the small price tag.  Also, the developer wants to eventually send his kid to a more expensive school.  Not very likely at this point, but one can dream..<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures<br/>\r\n- sandbox mode<br/>\r\n- 36 silly units (assets with custom AI written by us)<br/>\r\n- a handful of maps (assets with modifications)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/012eb7563e889ec2d61d6eba368f394b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 367, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NegativeGenius"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NegativeGenius"], "esrb_rating": null}
