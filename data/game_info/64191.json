Daniel Keldrik was a previous soldier who joined the biotic regime because he wanted to live up to his father. His father is known as the greatest biotic who ever lived and is royal protector to the king of Mars. After Daniel went through extensive genetic altering to unlock biotic abilities he was deemed an astronomical failure because he couldn't even perform elementary biotic tasks. Coming from a wealthy family, his father was able to get the king of Mars to fund scientists to develop a prototype bio-enhancer for his son so he could somewhat compete with his squad mates. Daniel, being the only biotic to ever have to rely on the bio-enhancer, gets harassed by his peers on a day to day basis. Daniel also took 3 years longer than his peers during his biotic training to graduate from the program even with his bio-enhancer.  Finally graduated, Daniel is assigned to his first mission with squad Omega, the worst squad in the regime. Things go completely haywire on his first mission and he is forced to resort to his instincts to survive. Follow him through the depths of hell and back as he learns the truth about the biotic regime and the dark transgressions of humanity.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/086/0865c68cff80790e117532b58f840b8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 589, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sameer Hirezi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sameer Hirezi"], "esrb_rating": null}
