The key feature of the game is a hydraulic system, which is accessible once the hydraulic pressure builds up.<br/><br/>Clear as many rows as you can, take advantage of the high value pieces and build up hydraulic pressure so if the field gets too full, it can save the day.<br/><br/>The game is available for Windows, a well designed options menu helps you increase the performance on older hardware.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ff/7ff5055bd2fd44179788c5e18fc58ad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["somgabor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
