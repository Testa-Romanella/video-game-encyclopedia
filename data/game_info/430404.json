Baseball, tennis, hockey, golf and nfl. Maybe even more. Added melee and tackles.<h3>Hit &amp; Push</h3>Basically you hit and push a big ball using your bat and your body.<br/><br/>How the ball reacts to a hit depends on quite a few factors, and yes it is difficult to understand at first, if you never tried anything like this before IRL. It takes some practice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. Your swing arc+range affects the angle of where the ball will move<br/>2. Where the ball is hit by your weapon (impact point) affects the direction, the cleaner and more precise a hit, the more power+control<br/>3. The amount of weapon-power (you can charge up an attack)<br/>4. Your movement speed, which builds up extra momentum <br/>5. The direction/momentum of the ball (if it moves towards you or lying still, it requires more power to move it, imagine 2 trains colliding)<br/>6. Where your aim your camera up and down, on ground and in air, (you can choose in settings between a fixed aim (default), and a rotational mouse-flick)<br/>7. Last but not least, rotational power, using your mouse to 'whip or flick' yourself/the camera when hitting the ball<h3>The Glowing Ball</h3>A shield protects your goal, and you cannot score a goal without breaking this goal shield.<br/>The ball is a lava chunk covered with metal plates, and gets unstable when hit hard. The ball becomes hot+glowing and this makes it able to break/melt through the goal shield. The glow does not last forever; how long, is linked to the amount of power of the hit.<br/><br/>Beware: the glowing ball can damage enemies. Using Block is a good idea.<br/><br/><h3>Combat</h3>You are allowed to attack your enemies, even combo's and a special attack is available. Damage drains Stamina. Use your turbo speed to tackle and damage enemies as well.<h3>Features</h3><br/>- Deep customization options with XP unlocks<br/>- 3 character classes, different stats and abilities<br/>- Online PvP<br/>- Casual 1v1 to 3v3<br/>- Custom Games<br/>- Training, invite friends, add bots and balls<br/>- Solo Games<br/>- Leaderboards<br/><br/><h3>The Brawler &amp; The Baller</h3>To keep it clean, we decided to part the original Mad Machines IP into 2 games, a Brawler and a Baller. <br/>They are using 2 different engines, both with each their own pros and cons.<br/><br/>The Brawler, Mad Machines 'Mad King', is using client-side tech, which provides top level responsiveness, less vulnerable to unstable internet and ping, but close encounter precision is not always great.<br/><br/>The Baller, Mad Machines 'Mad Ball', is using server-side tech, which makes impact precision in top, everything happens on everyone's screen, but vulnerable to unstable internet and ping.<h3>Roadmap &amp; The Devs</h3>Being almost a solo dev, we hope to execute this roadmap based on your support, and we have planned to add DLC's including skins, weapons and emotes.<br/><br/>- More skins, weapons, emotes<br/>- More regions (US+Asia)<br/>- More map skins<br/>- Ranked<br/>- Improved UX, UI - squads a.o<br/>- Optimizations<h3>Feedback &amp; Community</h3>Discord is our main,  feel free to also use the Steam community hub. <br/>We have weekly playsessions every Thursday, and you can always ask for coaching and games.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T04:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/548/5484987cfd941bafaa3cd8a7981c613b.jpg", "website": "http://www.madmachines.gg", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 345, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hero Blocks ApS"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Hero Blocks ApS"], "esrb_rating": null}
