These blackholes allow you to traverse space by using their gravity to slingshot yourself across the universe. Your spacecraft can access the void in order to use the space debris sent there to generate stars. There is an additional requirement of building enough kinetic energy to charge onboard batteries for the placement of stars, so moving quickly is important. Your score is built through in game actions, and remains unclaimed until you stop and attach your spacecraft to a star. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\r\nKey Features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe spacecraft is equipped with two indicators that must both be charged in order to place a star<br/>\r\n - The top of the space will turn black when you have collected enough debris<br/>\r\n - The bottom of the spacecraft will turn yellow when you have generated enough speed (reached a top speed of at least 600kp/s)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLeft-click to Place A Blackhole<br/>\r\n - Place near space debris to collect star fuel<br/>\r\n - Place near spacecraft to move<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRight-Click to place a star<br/>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game is in pre-alpha, and may be expanded upon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T02:30:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a6bdaafce5815a8cb1128f2061a786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlDonnieDarkRain"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["AlDonnieDarkRain"], "esrb_rating": null}
