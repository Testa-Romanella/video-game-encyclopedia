He's a fan of shields, lasers, and the song that plays while you fight him.</p>\n<p>The showman - This man wants to put on a show, and by that I mean he wants to shoot you and smack you with painful things. Your new ability comes in very handy!</p>\n<p>Kuri - The namesake of the game, a spooky dark figure in a stylish purple cloak. When they get angry, you really see them from a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Use all your cool hip abilities, like:</p>\n<p>Primary fire - Shoot a rapid-fire short-range magic projectile! Whoa!</p>\n<p>Dash - instantly teleport a short distance away! Wow!</p>\n<p>Two Secret Abilities - Unlock them by defeating the first two bosses! Holy cow!</p>\n\n<p>- BACKSTORY -</p>\n<p>- (not like lore, just about the dev process) -</p>\n<p>I made this in a game development class in high school. I tried to be pretty ambitious\u00a0 with our ~6 month development period. Up to this point I'd always had\u00a0an issue with motivating myself to get a project done,\u00a0so the added structure and deadlines from the class\u00a0are the reason this project was really able to exist. This project really helped me learn the skills of developing under a schedule. In fact,\u00a0as of writing this, I'm currently working on a similar boss-rush of slightly larger scope, this time with about 3.5 months of development time. (That game is almost out, keep your eyes peeled for it at\u00a0https://funndev.itch.io!)</p>\n<p>The title \"Kuri\" is taken from two other places. The main inspiration for this game was the game <em>Furi</em>, which is also a boss rush. Early in development, I also watched the show\u00a0<em>Fooly Cooly</em>, or, as it's written more faithfully to the Japanese title,\u00a0<em>Furi Kuri</em>. I figured that, since\u00a0<em>Furi</em> already existed, it was up to me to finish off the anime reference by naming my game\u00a0<em>Kuri</em>.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>LMB - Shoot</p>\n<p>RMB - Dash</p>\n<p>Shift/Ctrl - Unlockable Ability 1</p>\n<p>E - Unlockable Ability 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d730d6f9a2ca1b5941350897d5ea3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FunnDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
