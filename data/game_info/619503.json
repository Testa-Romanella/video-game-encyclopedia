You have to collect energy (this game's version of health), and ram into enemies to get points. You lose energy when you do that though, so be careful!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4df/4df6e767bce03bc8722da0251e0b2ebc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Monkosum"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
