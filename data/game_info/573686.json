Patients come in, are treated by nurses, and leave. Nurses occasionally have to go to the bathroom and will wet themselves if there is no other option, the doctor does very little other than research. You know, like a regular hospital.\u00a0<br/><br/>I consider this a work in progress and plan to deepen the simulation over time, but it's still just a demonstration of GOAP in Unity. You can place additional cubicles and toilets using the on screen UI and the mouse, and you can remove placed resources, and these new resources should be considered by the simulation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For now, I'll be uploading a zip instead of making this playable on the web, because Unity WebGL build seems to broken past 2018.1.4, and this had to be done in a later version of Unity to use certain features of the nav-mesh system.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T06:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c318d8a72479b6bc368273a9f0f2d78a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["knightmawk"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
