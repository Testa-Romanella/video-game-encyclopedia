Real hard. Like <em>flappy bird </em>hard.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Play in 16x9 resolution</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to control the dragon.\u00a0Check out <strong>youtube trailer</strong> for a quick guide!</p>\n<p>Move mouse forward to point wings up, backward to point wings down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To ascend, gently flap wings by pointing wings up and\u00a0down (moving mouse up and down). To make a dive, hold wings all the way up (or way down). To glide, hold wings in a neutral position.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move mouse left/right to roll. Do it quickly to do a barrel roll in either direction.</p>\n<p>Barebones Storyline</p>\n<p>Mankind has upset nature's balance, and its up to you to get rid of the scourge of humanity. Destroy the man-made buildings with your spicy breath. But don't get hit!<br/></p>\n<p>This only has 1 tutorial level and 2 extra levels, however I'm glad of what I could cram in the jam time. Try going for the elusive SS Rank! (Take no damage and destroy all buildings)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: WebGL HTML5 version taken off, until I get the mouse cursor bias fixed! For now please use the download.\u00a0Have added Mac and Linux builds finally!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Music: remix of CapDan ZeroSumGame - Original by Zakarra in LMMS<br/></p>\n<p>SFX: from Freesounds and LMMS, edited in\u00a0Audacity</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>Dragon model from\u00a0PigArt</p>\n<p>Low Poly Medieval Buildings (House, Tower) by JPrinslooS</p>\n<p>Water FX by Holyshift</p>\n<p>Skybox by Boxophobic<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca2421c657465ddceb3f4e828920dd30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["randomphantom"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
