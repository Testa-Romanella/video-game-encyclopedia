Some of the tracks are more Open World like, so you can drift to your liking, no road to follow, just drift how you like. You can select from 21 rims, and Painting options are endless. Stance your car out and equip a roll cage, you can really show your style. Add camber or just lower your ride, it's totally up to you, but don't forget, every suspension adjustment affects drivability.
