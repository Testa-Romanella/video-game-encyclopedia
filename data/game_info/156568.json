The theme was \"Dual Purpose Design\", inspired by the arcade game Downwell. The idea was to create a game where one mechanic served multiple purposes.</p><p><strong>How does your submission match the theme?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you move using the recoil from firing your gun - dodges are attacks and vice versa. However, you can't just mash fire and hope for the best: hitting a civilian means an instant game over, while a poorly-timed shot will send you careening into hazards. Therefore, any action calls for precision and forethought.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-party resources</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made with Game Maker.<br/>Music made in Famitracker.<br/>Sound effects made with sfxr.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Richard Gottlieb (me).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b4/7b46f7c5ecf3ef4b77a0d00531adc2a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dogpsychology"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
