You begin chained to the wall somewhere in a dungeon without any signs of life or knowledge about how deep down you actually are. To break out, you will have to solve puzzles and unlock new paths. The chain that ties you to the wall keeps you from moving freely, and you will have to find ways to work around this problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>Move:\t\tarrow keys/WASD<br/>Interact:\tF</p>\n<p><strong>The project:<br/></strong>The game was developed using the Godot engine. All sounds and art-assets are self-produced. The project was created by 3 people during the summer of 2018. The project was a chance for the team-members to learn about game development and to get comfortable with coding in the specific game engine.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68d10f600b126b1717fa2f29776f7619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Douglas Driving"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
