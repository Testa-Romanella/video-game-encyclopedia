Works on anything that supports HTML5 (even phones!)<br/></p>\n<p>Dwarphan is a game where you (a dwarf) dig up treasure and give it to an orphanage in debt, before the landlord paves over it (and everyone inside). Stave off the slowly approaching bulldozer five times to save the orphanage and win! Try and get as high of a score as you can before the game ends.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Left, right: Move dwarf<br/>Up, down: Select menu items<br/>Z, X: Dig<br/>Enter: Start/interact with menus</p>\n<p>Some tips:<br/>- Make sure to leave enough time to get back up!<br/>- You move faster the more gold you have. Use that to your advantage!<br/>- Digging upgrades not only upgrade your initial speed, but your top speed as well!</p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:54:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14c/14cfcbf83a8baa9ddf8ce64f7dd629ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kale"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
