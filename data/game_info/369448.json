It takes times to get to the correct answer but it's a good learning experience</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How I reach at this point:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>I haven't counted the number of hours I took for finishing the projects but it should be at least 10 hours</li><li>I started the assignment and was blocked by solution error and had to wait for the new solution</li><li>I had many linker errors, first one was related to OpenGLExtensions project and the second most problematic link error was because I forgot to\u00a0forced include the Direct3D and OpenGl libraries to the graphics project</li><li>One more build error that trouble me was, I forgot to add dependencies to BuildMyGameAssets project after creating it and I didn't even realize it</li><li>While I was testing project references, I found an interesting thing that once you build your project with some references that build order is fixed unless you change the project dependencies.</li><li>While creating the changing color animation, when I used the sin function, as it was giving as -1 to 1, I created a function that acts like abs using abs because, I\u00a0wanted to added extra stuff to shader file, but it was giving we few color changes.</li><li>Which let me to think that if i use sin function than the values for RGB would be always equal, and I remember form option challenges that changes in simulation time would help me create different RGB values every time so I added constants to the simulation time before giving it to sin function which is giving me the output as seen in .exe file</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Questions regarding optional challenges</strong></p>\n<p>I have not added anything related to optional challenges in the code as well as .exe\u00a0</p>\n<p>For slowing down the animation using simulation time, I don't know whether my way of thinking is correct or not but what I think is using time(null) function every time the user presses the button I subtract the current time with start time and multiplying it with a constant less than 1 which results in the time being same giving us the slowing effect.</p>\n<p>I would love to have feedback on that</p><p>Contributors/ Helpers:</p><p>Arash Tadjiki\u00a0</p><p>Rohan Patel\u00a0</p><p>Luis Garcia Remes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a97ca028553a146174cab84a58ae9432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M17D05"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
