The experience explores the ideas of love and fear, and offers practical steps on how you can improve your life and change the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEssentially a multimedia book, the experience lasts about 30 minutes and explores many serious and deep issues, such as the ideological differences between people of faith and the scientific community, the people's freedom and the government's order, and explores how the emotions of love and fear hold a deeper meaning in life.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are no choices or branching. It is, in essence, a book. However there are real time 3D graphics running in the background, and relaxing music to listen to as you read. The graphics are configurable for both high-end and low-end machines, and you can hide the text and just watch the experience as a looping benchmark. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPress Alt + Enter for Full Screen mode. <br/>\r\nPress Space to Toggle Text. <br/>\r\nPress Escape to Access Options.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a604973a3e5bbda7735a43b1281c0d3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Andres Hernandez", "cybereality"], "genres": ["Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["cybereality"], "esrb_rating": null}
