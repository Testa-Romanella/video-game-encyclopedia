People once thought no one can find actual evidence about those stories. At least not until one day, a family of five moved in. Everything was normal until the end of the first week when things started going missing: from toys to clothes to electronics. During the day, the doors would open and close randomly, and during the nights, the family would hear a wide range of sounds of children playing. They have tried installing cameras and radars, but nothing was detected. After a month, they could not take it any longer and went to the closest village to find a solution to these problems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is a 2D single player side scroller game in which the player acts as the infamous ghost hunter hired to help the family solve the mansion\u2019s mysteries. There is a huge amount of negative energy inside the mansion from previous tenants who passed away. To dispose this unknown energy, the player must accomplish the wills/quests of the wandering ghosts and let their souls rest in peace. Science is not invincible, but a true ghost hunter can be.</p>\r\nCREDIT:\r\n<p>Jiaxin Huang - UI and UX Artist/Designer/Programmer</p>\n<p>Background Music -\u00a0Peder B.
