This is left over the early days of development and still needs some work. If you are trying to play this on SteamDeck I would encourage you NOT to do so. This game is not in any way shape or form built for SteamDeck. It is intended to be played on a desktop machine with a decent sized monitor.<br/><br/><strong>It is the year 2230.</strong><br/><br/>After nearly 100 years of expansion and colonization in space, the human species stands on the brink of war. On one side is the corrupt and aging Sol Confederacy. On the other is the fledgling, Frontier Republic. Neither one is willing to compromise and the coming war will see entire worlds decimated for it.<br/><br/>But way on the fringes of colonized space. On a lonely moon called Frontiers Reach. Captain Anya Zuban and First Mate Rhen Malavik are prepping their vessel, the Heliosiren, to ferry a group of survivors deep into uncharted space to escape the coming war.<br/><br/><strong>!Attention!</strong> Frontiers Reach is what might be referred to as a sim-lite game. The idea being that some level of simulation is being conducted to achieve the desired experience. In Frontiers Reach the following things are being simulated.<br/><br/>Radar - Though ranges are much shorter than real world radar, each fighter, capital ship, turret, SAM, and ground vehicle has a radar/sensor that allows them to scan the battlefield and make a determination about what targets are in range and how to prioritize them for engagement. This includes an actual refresh rate which can be seen in the players radar. No corners were cut here.<br/><br/>Physics and Gravity - Each planetary location has gravity which will affect nearly everything. From the high energy rounds exiting the barrels of your fighters cannons on up to frigates and carriers.<br/><br/>Sandbox style levels - Though contained, each level is a sandbox style environment with its own ambient spawns. Fighters spawn at airfields, cargo vessels can be seen landing at settlements (careful you don't run into one of them), and a bullet fired from one end of the map will hit something on the other end even if your not there to experience it. These sandbox style levels are used as backdrops for all of the missions and become even more dynamic when played on the WARMAP which is a whole other sandbox mechanic on it's own.<br/><br/>Bot AI that can truly be unpredictable - The dogfighting behavior of the NPCs in Frontiers Reach has been designed to be aggressive and unpredictable. While it can make the best possible decision at times, it can also make bad decisions like a human being would.<br/><br/>The Cockpit - While each fighter has a different layout using the same set of instrumentation, each cockpit has been designed with the intention of putting you into something that looks and feels like a machine from the Atomic Age. As such the cockpits of Frontiers Reach are highly detailed, responsive, and filled with useful information you will need at some point in a flight.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Frontiers Reach is a mission based, story driven, sim-lite space and atmospheric combat game with a retro-aesthetic inspired by the Cold War era of our own history. </strong> With simulator like levels of mechanical detail, fight your way through 25 story missions across several of the games locations, dogfighting and barnstorming throughout. Talk to characters aboard the Heliosiren to get side missions for additional lore and salvage points. And engage in an interstellar war across 37 locations.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Create your character! </strong> Choose a portrait, name, profession, and a homeworld. All to be referenced in the dialogue as the story unfolds. Or choose to start later and skip the first campaign all together and join the war sooner.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Engage with crew members! </strong> The Galley is a great place to get more info on characters, world events, or pick up a couple of side jobs for those extra salvage points when you need them.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Fly for the mission, or fly for the challenge!</strong> What fighter you choose and the weapons it carries are for you to decide.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Your starfighter is your space hotrod!</strong> From the engines to the countermeasures, spec out your fighter to your liking with the tools available and the salvage on hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Fly your own colors, or create a squadron!</strong> Choose a squadron logo and color scheme for your fighter and save it out so you can then share it with friends across the internet.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Detailed cockpits!</strong> Every fighter has a detailed cockpit with lots of visual feedback that you can leverage while you fly, or fly by the seat of your pants if you choose.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Survive an interstellar war!</strong> The war for the frontier rages, the fleet of survivors needs to be built. Once you've completed the first 25 missions the WARMAP will open up and a new act in the story will playout on it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Form up your wing!</strong> Alongside the WARMAP comes the BERTH. This room will allow you to organize wingmen into flights you can then choose to take on WARMAP missions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Can you brave the worlds of the wild frontier?</strong> With over 35 locations there is a wide array of diversity throughout the Frontiers Reach Universe. Some will present extreme challenges, and others will offer serene views.<br/><br/>Last but not at all least. Frontiers Reach is <strong>Adult Accessible</strong>! All of the activities in Frontiers Reach have been designed to be completed within a 20 minute time span. With some activities leaving the option for resupply and untimed exploration of the level at your leisure. Frontiers Reach is a game you can play on a lunch break.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T06:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2b/a2bdbece53f30bfb21056df4c966091e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Blind Alien Productions"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Blind Alien Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
