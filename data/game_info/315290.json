Distractions are everywhere.\u00a0 Face them and fight honorably to reach the state of flow or end up doomed at the bottom of procrastination food chain.</p>\n<p>Developed for LudumDare44 for theme Your life is a currency the game is short casual experiment inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. While the actual gameplay is wastly different (not to mention producion qualities), I believe that both boil down to simple observation and reaction at the right time as well as planning your actions beforehand based on the situation. I let player be the judge of whether I managed to recreate similarly skill-based, potentially frustrating but ultimately rewarding experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:44:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["oakus"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
