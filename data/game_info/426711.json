{"id": 426711, "slug": "trampoline-gunmen-iii-lucky-strike", "name": "Trampoline Gunmen III - Lucky Strike", "name_original": "Trampoline Gunmen III - Lucky Strike", "description": "<p>Due to a lack of time, motivation and the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure no one ever actually plays the games I develop, I am abandoning TG3 and releasing the BETA to the world. The 2 player mode functions, with multiple characters, stats and special attacks, there\u2019s a few animated backgrounds, and some ripped music. That\u2019s about it. The game is compiled as an EXE, so you won't need QB64 to run it - this also means it's Windows PC only. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>TG3 is \u2013 or rather would be if I completed it \u2013 how I envisioned TG to be back in 1999. At least after I stopped thinking of it as a \u201cmattress landing game\u201d. There\u2019s 6 characters. Each has different stats for starting health, POW, max bullets, attack strength, available speeds, and special moves. I\u2019m pretty sure all of them are unbalanced. Mango has too much HP and his attacks hit too hard. The Hobo only has one bullet which is really annoying. Lawna loses health too fast and her recharge move breaks the game. Azdash has REALLY weak attacks.</p>\n<p>Special Attacks:</p>\n<p>Mango \u2013 shoots a homing cow, one hit kill (but you can shoot the cow and kill it). <br/><br/>Hobo \u2013 remove enemy ammo, warp them to top of screen with downward movement, gain +2 ammo</p>\n<p>Natali \u2013 shoots out whip, if it touches enemy their HP reduced to 1</p>\n<p>Lawna \u2013 recharges health (also, when hitting the trampoline 50% chance of finding spare ammo)</p>\n<p>Azdash \u2013 wall of bullets!</p>\n<p>Jeffer \u2013 removes enemy POW and changes their direction (I think his shots also reduce enemy POW)</p>\n<p>Despite how broken the underlying system is, I\u2019m extremely pleased with how I managed to differentiate them. The Hobo has free speed changes thanks to belching and farting, while Natali has dual pistols \u2013 one for attacking and one for speed. Also, there\u2019s neat Easter Eggs like when Natali fights Natali they get their whips entangled. The lightning during the storm. The little petals of the cherry blossom tree which stay on the ground. The backgrounds I\u2019m also quite proud of \u2013 the storm and blossom ones are improved updates from the last game, but the Castlevania inspired Church background is really special. Took ages to make the cogs line up with each other.</p>\n<p>If you play it, please, PLEASE make it full screen with ALT + ENTER. Keep an eye on the timer, since when it hits zero that round is over. Also, keep in mind it's technically not finished. If it were I'd include multiple options, alternate controls, and all the other stuff you'd expect. I'd also code a solid internal timer, to detect how fast a computer is. The quick and dirty fix is typing it in each time you start. Apologies for the slapdash nature of this.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m including the source code if you want to tinker. It contains a fully compiled EXE, so you can boot it like that. If you want to play around with the source you can open it any TXT editor, but you'll need QB64 to recompile it. <br/>Also, if you want to remake it for iOS and turn me (and you) into billionaires, you know how to reach me.
