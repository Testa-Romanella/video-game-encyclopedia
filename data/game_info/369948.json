Bearing only the smallest portion of their original power, even though they are no longer sealed, they are weak.

I am sorry. Fade transitions gave me so much trouble and I didn't have time to debug them when I was so busy doing everything else that I just left them out entirely.<br/></p>\n<p>- The textboxes are misaligned constantly/best guess because I don't know how to center them to a camera properly (this is my second time using one).</p>\n<p>- The autosave function is\u00a0<em>very</em> simple - it saves your room location, but I don't know how to make it save other stuff that marks your progress, since this is my first time using a save system. You may have to do things again if you load a saved game - I'm not sure.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>V2 + V3 bugfix:</strong> YOU CAN FINISH THE GAME NOW??
