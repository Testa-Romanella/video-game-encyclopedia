Puppet Rush is a fast paced, 2D game where you play as a Psychic One-Eyed Monster who wants a Golden Knife. For that you have to kill and deposit some innocent\u00a0puppets. Go close to them and the knifes will kill them but you cannot kill more than the number of knives you have. So you need to constantly deposit the kills. But also you need to save the Knife Machine from the Bomber Red Puppets before they get too close and explode.</p>\n<p>This is my entry for \"My First Game Jam: Winter 2023\". I had an absolutely fun time creating this within the jam time and being able to complete it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am an Indie Dev. So all the Game Code, Art, Sound and everythign has been done by me.</p>\n<p>I would really appreciate any kind of feedback I can get on this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out\u00a0My Youtube where I will soon post a Devlog for this game.<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for checking this out! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T08:04:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fa9971f25ab75baab0d575d19be2f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["DinoNyte"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
