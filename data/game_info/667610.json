It relies on a lot of moving objects to bring the system to it's end stage with all four balls landing in their boxes. The system makes use of Unity's colliders, rigid bodies, and physics mechanisms but does not utilize any code. I\u00a0tried to create some form of gears and seesaws to push around the objects along with\u00a0dominos and angled boxes. I also played around with different materials for the objects to make the scene look nicer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T07:29:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dce72d4014498f7e86c001a00081ff6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ItzBosco"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
