Help or hinder them by guiding them to a path of freedom or swatting them back. You and a friend can play together remotely in PC and VR. The asynchronous gameplay has the PC user attempting to help as many toys escape as possible, whilst the VR user has to find them and stop them from escaping. The storeroom is full of different toys, and at the start of each round the PC user is assigned one at random to control, attempting to blend in with the others. Create a server on pc and join, press F to take control of a toy and move using WASD/mouse. A VR player can join the server, the VR player can pick up a flashlight and a hammer, look around with the light and bop the toys to stop them escaping, get a toy out of the door to escape!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T09:37:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5eed0718ffefaccc36e787ccca12c323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Parse(Nips);"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
