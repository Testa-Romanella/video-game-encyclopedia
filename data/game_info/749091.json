Beyond the steel and stone gate lies the twisting expanse of the <strong>DUNJUN</strong>, filled with vile monsters and deadly traps. Aspirants travel from lands near and far to delve into the <strong>DUNJUN</strong>\u2019s timeless depths, seeking treasure, knowledge, and fame alike. Time has forgotten the <strong>DUNJUN</strong>\u2019s origins, but many a rumor escapes the lips of bards, scholars, and soldiers. </p>\n<p>In <strong><em>DUNJUNGUY</em></strong>, a party of up to four friends can test their might against the hordes of creatures in the <strong>DUNJUN</strong>. Combining Action RPG mainstays with mechanics familiar to Roguelike fans, players can choose abilities, find powerful gear, and navigate procedurally generated environments while staving off impending doom. <em><strong>DUNJUNGUY</strong></em><strong> </strong>delivers a cartoony visual style, contrasted by its exploration of macabre and moody touchstones. <br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Title: <em><strong>DUNJUNGUY</strong></em>\n</li><li>Created by Aga Pito Studios    \r\n</li><li>Open Alpha, available now for free    \r\n</li><li>Platforms: PC\u00a0(MacOS\u00a0be strugglin)    \r\n</li><li>Website/Download: https://www.agapitostudios.com    \r\n</li><li>Socials:  <ul><li>Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/agapitostudios    \r\n</li><li>Discord: https://discord.gg/zJYkDaqKxB    \r\n</li><li>Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/agapitostudios    \r\n</li><li>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezKjjk1ACAh6dNYv8u4u0Q    \r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Genre: Roguelite/RPG    \r\n</li><li>Contact: devteam@agapitostudios.com\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:36:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66be351c93779aaf567a22f5662b691c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aga Pito Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
