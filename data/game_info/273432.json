He's sacrificing himself to protect his country at all cost. He even invades Mexico just to make sure his country is safe. Help him by walking through the levels and defeating every enemy that walks your path. But beware that you damage yourself by jumping, which is a sacrifice you're willing to take to take down those pesky mexicans trying to take over your country.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88e2783bb1e0b29506b7e725b18dddb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkAnice"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
