The current game mode is called Assault. the goal is to take the bomb at the center of the map and deliver it to the enemy base.<br/><br/><strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\u00a0</strong><br/>at least 7.5 GB of hard drive space<br/>Windows<br/>8GB of RAM<br/>4GB Graphics Card<br/>3.5 GHz CPU<br/><br/>The AI can be very demanding on the CPU which is impacting the performance a lot right now. It's at the top of the list of improvements since I\u00a0want this to run like butter on a good PC and run at a respectable frame rate on mid tier PC's. if you have an older PC you might struggle with it right now. I recommend turning shadows and post process to medium to gain back some performance.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba3bbbbf8022bdb73d76e3cd9f05907.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steven - Inverted Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
