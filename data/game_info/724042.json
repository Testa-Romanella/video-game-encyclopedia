Park-Boy!\"</strong> is a simple game I made about watering flowers, spreading joy and rebuilding things that were once broken.<br/><br/>It was heavily inspired by the games like \"Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol\" and \"Katamari Damacy\" - two of my favourite games.<br/><h3>Story</h3>In the game, you play as Yuu-Boy - an alien that has crash-landed in an old city park.<br/><br/>His ship ran out of fuel (which of course, is happiness) and now he is stuck. <br/><br/>You have no choice but to try and spread love as much as you can to try and get Yuu-Boy home!<br/><br/>You do this, at first, by watering flowers - but over time you unlock the ability to redecorate the park with items you buy.<br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Water flowers and make them dance.<br/></li><li>Buy and sell objects for your park and decorate it however you like.<br/></li><li>Unlock tools and upgrades for Yuu-Boy.</li></ul><br/>I hope you enjoy my game!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T04:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebd399fdd46a58619c8008b0cfad9204.jpg", "website": "http://heyparkboy.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trey Brown"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Trey Brown"], "esrb_rating": null}
