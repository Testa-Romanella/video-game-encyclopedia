In Void Looper you dive into the void with your mecha and blast incoming waves of enemies, dodge bullets, collect power ups and rack up multipliers. Controls and design are super simple and easy to learn, but with loads of depth beneath the surface.<br/></p>\n<p>After finishing U.F.O offline, I still had some plans for the game and I made it my goal to turn this scuffed jam project into an actual game. I've been really busy with my visual communications studies, but fortunately I took the opportunity to develop this demo as a part of my thesis work. So this demo is the production part of my thesis.</p>\n<p>This demo is a preview of a game in development. It is still missing some key features. Art assets, sound assets, gameplay mechanics, overall structure, story and difficulty are a subject to change.</p>\n<p>Planned Features:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Upgrades between levels\r\n</li><li>Iron out some flaws with Dash mechanic\r\n</li><li>An Actual Storyline\r\n</li><li>More levels with more dynamic backgrounds\r\n</li><li>More varied enemies\r\n</li><li>Two Player Mode</li></ul>\n<p>Feedback and suggestions are appreciated :)</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>This game can be played with Keyboard ,\u00a0Xbox One controller and PS4 controller</p>\n<p>You can switch between fullscreen and windowed by pressing ALT + ENTER\r\n</p>\n<p>You can Exit the game by holding down ESC\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>- - This game does contain frequent flashing lights - -</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Music from Action Game Loops - Rock Music Loops by Andrey Sitkov\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound Effects by Juhani Junkala / SubspaceAudio @ OpenGameArt\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32f/32f3fbb19e48fdf607a0134e3fbeb09f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jugi"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
