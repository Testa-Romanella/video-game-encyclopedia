Each level has a lot of coins, and there are obstacles that are destroyed when you collect the required amount of coins, and then you can go through the level further. Further on the levels, enemy characters appear, which, like obstacles, prevent your hero from advancing along the level. And also there are various traps and other things that can both interfere and help your character. Good luck with your walkthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures:<br/>\r\n-Animated graphics.<br/>\r\n-Simple, funny gameplay.<br/>\r\n-Unforgettable adventures.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T04:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bb/5bb8fc069c0af9deb913179876c6a422.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Pirate Snails", "MaxDidIt", "SammyLand"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["kovalevviktor"], "esrb_rating": null}
