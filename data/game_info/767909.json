Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>[ A Message From Your Boss ]</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hey kid\u2026 welcome to your first day at the IRS.\r\n</p>\n<p>April 16th ain\u2019t a great day for us historically speaking, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine.\r\n</p>\n<p>Job\u2019s simple. Just take the forms coming off the line here and stick \u2018em in the right pile.\r\n</p><p>I\u2019ll come back and inspect your sorting every now and then, but don\u2019t sweat it too much. Definitely don\u2019t need all the forms sorted correctly. Let\u2019s just say\u2026 half the forms? Yeah, that\u2019s good enough for government work.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s your official grab-o-matic to do the job. It\u2019s top secret tech kid, so don\u2019t go blabbin\u2019 about it when you get home.\r\n</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, just make sure you don\u2019t miss any forms before they reach the end of the conveyor.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can be a pretty lousy sorter, but they\u2019ll pretty much fire you right on the spot for missing a few forms.\r\n</p>\n<p>Harsh, I know. I don\u2019t make the rules kid, I just enforce \u2018em.\r\n</p>\n<p>Anyway, I\u2019ll be back in a bit, good luck.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrows - Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>Left Click - Tether a Form\r\n</p>\n<p>Right Click - Release Tethers\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T03:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd0/fd0751f4bc5c5ce9eea1a56fb105717d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bogden"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
