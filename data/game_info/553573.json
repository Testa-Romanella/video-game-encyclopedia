But with an upgrade.</p>\n<p>In this game, you can select between 3 different backgrounds and you can also choose your input, if you want to play with the space key, as normally, or if you want to play with your microphone input, as this was the purpose of the game on our college subject.\u00a0<br/>You can choose to use either one way or the other. The Mic option works based on sounds, not dictation, so you can make the Dino jump by saying whatever word you want.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy and don't forget this is a college project done in less than one month, so we are sorry for any problems it might have.<br/>Also please leave a comment saying how do you feel about the use of Microphone to play a game, either in a game like this one, or any other game that could be played totally with voice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T06:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6cb2d8264a05a9e40fc9c65a65f96d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pepe2992"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
