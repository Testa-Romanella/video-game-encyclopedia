Faithully(??) adapted from the original award-winning (Dionysia Choice Award, 405 BC) play by Aristophanes, The Frogs is a (semi)point-and-click adventure game in the vein of the Ace Attorney or Professor Layton series. Use your powers of persuasion to make your way through Hades to return class, culture and art to a world dominated by lowbrow, hack comedy... And maybe have some laughs along the way.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This game is currently unfinished.
