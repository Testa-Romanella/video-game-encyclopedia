{"id": 93545, "slug": "omdo", "name": "OMDO", "name_original": "OMDO", "description": "<p>OMDO plays just like DOOM, except every frame is a random dot\u00a0autostereogram. If you don't know what that is, you should read more about it here, but the gist is that you have to either go cross-eyed or wall-eyed in order to see the game. Otherwise it just looks like a bunch of random dots.</p>\n<p>The first three maps\u00a0should be fully functional, thanks to DoomLoader (see below). It helps to be familiar with those maps beforehand, but not necessary.\u00a0You can switch between cross and parallel view, depending on what you're most comfortable with.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Regular DOOM controls for the most part. WASD and mouse to move and look. Space to use, left click to shoot. If you hit a wall at the end of a corridor it's probably a door, try hitting space.</p>\r\nStuff I Used\r\n<p>I used DoomLoader, an amazing Unity asset package made by Risto Paasivirta\u00a0for loading DOOM WAD files directly into Unity. Only the first DOOM WAD is included, which is available as shareware on the wiki.</p>\n<p>The autostereogram algorithm was originally written in C in a paper published by Harold Thimbleby, Stuart Inglis, and Ian Witten. A webapp called MagicEye.js adapted it to JS, and I made a very similar version in C# for Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b65/b650ccc1b5f06cd9fb7012c43b332998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["blogum"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
