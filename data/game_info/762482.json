Annoy whoever you want! Throw poop at that annoying tiger, or those petty penguins! <br/>Do beware. You do have to be careful, because not everyone likes it when you throw poop at them or steal their items. Especially the guards, they are not a big fan of you going outside of your cage.</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas for further development in our game please let us know!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T16:00:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cb/4cbaf7026a7a1ce1d27812b830a0bcca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mart", "FlorisBieling", "DylanVermeulen", "JortKeppel", "DanielAntonian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
