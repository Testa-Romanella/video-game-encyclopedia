You have limited time to get to a checkpoint and when you reach one you get some extra time\u00a0and the cycle repeats. Each time you reach a checkpoint your maximum speed increases by a small amount, but you also get less and less time to complete the next part of the lap. The checkpoint are easy to spot in-game, they are red-yellow geometrical shapes forming a tunel around the track.</p>\n<p>The map you'll be driving on\u00a0is a closed loop, but it is not a circle, it's a twisted\u00a0<strong>M\u00f6bius strip</strong>. The first checkpoint-gate is a triangle and if you drive long enough you will reach it again, only on the bottom side of the track (technically the track has no bottom or top surface - it's the same surface all way round).</p>\r\nInstallation:\r\n<p>To run the game simply unpack the archive and run the binary (.exe) file.</p>\n<p>To run the game in full screen mode you will need to edit the provided config.ini file, just change 'fullscreen = 0' to 'fullscreen = 1' and set the appropriate resolution using the 'win-size' value</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>By default the game uses <strong>W-A-S-D</strong>\u00a0keys, but these keys can be\u00a0changed in the games Options menu. Gamepad buttons can also be used (but not analog sticks). You will also need a mouse to navigate the menu.</p>\n<p>The two bars, visible in the top left corner,\u00a0after a race starts are a speed meter (the blue one) and a timer (the red one).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The source code of this game will be made available at a later date.</p>\r\nP.S.
