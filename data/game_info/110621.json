{"id": 110621, "slug": "magic-missile-command", "name": "Magic Missile Command", "name_original": "Magic Missile Command", "description": "<p>In this variant of arcade classic, Missile Command, you control three wizards armed with the magic missile spell, facing a goblin horde awaiting outside the walls of your fortified library.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for Missile Command Throwback jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The goblins will launch themselves over the walls via catapults in order to steal your spellbooks. Smite them down before they steal all of your books and kill you. Each wave is more difficult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Aim and move the camera by moving the mouse.</li><li>Each wizard can cast magic missile independently. Use the 1, 2, and 3 key on the top of the keyboard. Hold down for rapid fire. There is a limited amount of castings, - you can see how many are left next to the targeting reticle.</li><li>Left click to make all the wizards fire at the same time.</li></ul>\n<p>If a goblin runs into a wizard (or lands on the wizard), the wizard will die. If a goblin grabs a spellbook and brings it past the red/white striped line at the far right edge of the map, then it escapes with it, forever.<br/></p>\n<p>You get more magic missile spells after each wave, depending on how many spell books are left. So if you run entirely out of spells, just pray and hope that you survive until the next wave, when you get more spells.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong>: \"Killers\" by Kevin Macleod (incompetech.com), Creative Commons by Attribution 3.0.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, Audacity, Gimp<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/345b2da50c140bf1682429a82acea17f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
