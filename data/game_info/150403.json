The tasks keep coming in on each individual workstation as you work to keep up. You have to work fast though as each task has a deadline for when you can start it. Don't start the task after the deadline and you miss the chance. Not completing your work will reflect negatively on your upcoming performance review! Not only will you not get the promotion, but miss too much work or mess up a lot and you may even get fired for your poor or lack of work output.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do you have what it takes to get that promotion?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse</p>\n<p>A D Keys for quick turn left and right</p>\n<p>Addition Info:</p>\n<p>I intended this to be a fast paced game where you are constantly juggling the three workstations where the first, you receive program cartridges and you insert them into the workstation and it provides you with the commands you need to input in order to fix the program cartridge. The second workstation (to the right) is where circuit boards come in to your task pile and inserting it into your workstation gives you the manual that tells you the right logic gates you need to drag and drop into which slots in order to fix the circuit. The final workstation would have you writing manuals by selecting the key words needed to complete the manual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think this game would have great potential for VR.\u00a0 I\u00a0think i did okay for my first game jam ever.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aec/aec47caf8ead6874a49f5a30a42437da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kpable"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
