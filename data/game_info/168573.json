There\u2019s some minor to major\u00a0slowdown in places (the last level is <em>particularly</em> gnarly in this setup) mostly to do with emulating the entire system in JavaScript, but they\u2019ll have to stand as I\u00a0don\u2019t see many better options!<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope you enjoy this now-preserved \u201cclassic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2013Jessica</p>\n<p>Obviously I do not own The Simpsons, nor the sprites used here. Please be kind! I just want to share this absurd thing I\u00a0made when I was young and ridiculous.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/1330b805e73e6bf6e18f89ec90fb5142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jessica"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
