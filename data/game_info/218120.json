The player at the right hand can start a new column, with a card marked with a six, or make any of the movements that are explained below. <br/><br/>In any open column you can play cards up or down with the same suit, but (this is the key feature of Crazy Six) not necessarily with the card immediately above or below that is in place. Ie below the 6 you can put the 2. This means that players who have the 3, 4 and 5 will not be able to discard that cards. <br/><br/>When you don\u00b4t have any card to play you must pass. <br/><br/>The game ends when aces and tens are placed. Then you count the cards of each player and loses who reaches the chosen score", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9b6e95c7d192031e4cc5984d471e9e.jpg", "website": "http://", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lugan Software"], "genres": ["Card", "Family"], "publishers": ["Juan Luis Ganchegui Olasolo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
