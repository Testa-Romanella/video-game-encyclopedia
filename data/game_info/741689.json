Malcontent with his life as a Mook, he dreams of becoming a Boss and having a chance of beating the adventurers.</p>\n<p>Gobli gets his chance when he gets a call from the programmer, saying he must go out and replace some of the slimes who are sick in the upper world. He ventures out; and along the way runs into a sprite whose only purpose is being a human-shaped hole in the wall, who decides to join him so he may gain a movement range. Once the slimes are taken care of, they venture out to change their purposes. Along the way they meet the cat Neko, a semi-rival to Gobli who also dreams of becoming a boss.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T03:46:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/909/90946322f7d42f574eba4326ae07625a.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/psx_rpgmaker", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
