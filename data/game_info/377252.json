There is also a portable suicide method in the collectible safety pins the player can create from gathering stickpins. I\u2019m releasing this demo as an unfinished build to get feedback/view playtester bugs so I know what to fix in the final release, so it would be helpful if anyone wants to link me to any let\u2019s plays they come up with.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and I hope you enjoy trying out the early version of the game!</p>\n<p>--Suits</p>\n<p>NOTE: Controls are IN GAME. The game supports both gamepad and keyboard/mouse ( you need to pick which one at the start of the game ) Would recommend headphones, thanks to all the musicians who contributed to the music, some of it is placeholder for now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T04:55:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac9/ac9bd8dc1941d958bc37e8209af16a04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuitsnNukes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
