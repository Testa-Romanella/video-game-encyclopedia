Unlock new ways of visualizing music.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Explore an infinite space of infinitely changing music<p>\r\n\tEach piece of music created in Phasing is different in detail but similar in form. From this perspective, each piece of music is a different aspect of the same underlying whole, an interconnected musical space.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>Inspired by Piano Phase<p>\r\n\tTaking its cue from Steve Reich's 1967 piece Piano Phase, Phasing is about creating multifaceted music from simple starting points: a melody and a process that transforms the melody. Two pianists play two identical melodies. One pianist plays faster, gradually overtaking the other. As the piece develops, unexpected harmonic patterns seem to come together and then drift apart, giving way to new patterns.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee5/ee584d8ef5dd54352074046c3e82baad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["James Morrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
