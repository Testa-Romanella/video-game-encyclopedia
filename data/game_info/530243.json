Go grab trashes from the trash bins and make mess!\u00a0</p>\n<p>PLUS:</p>\n<p>Due to my back injury and so many finals coming together, I really did not have much time to make it more fancy (like adding an actual grabbing system or textures and animations). But yeah, my back injury really annoyed and kinda slowed me down for everything. The idea of this game is to relax and make a mess, so I did not set a winning condition and you basically are just messing around in it. Have Fun! And please don't scold me if it's not fun. :(</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T09:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cde/cde90ae776d166d9c643ff9bb49b91b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AirJaden"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
