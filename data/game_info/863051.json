You also have to <strong>manage how much everyone like you</strong> or you might not be able to get a real date with the person you truly want.</p>\n<p>This game was made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 51. The theme was <em><strong>Every 10 seconds</strong></em>. Here's a link to the Ludum Dare page.</p>\r\n\u2757 Rules\r\n<p>Each day consists of five 10 second interval dates. In each date the character will tell you 2 things about themselves. <strong>You do NOT need to reply to the exact things the character tells you</strong>, they serve only as hints to show what the character likes. If a chracter hearts something that doesn't mean it is only that thing, they will also heart other similar things as well, so figure what they like based on the hints and the character themselves.</p>\n<p>Icon explanations: heart means they super like it, plus sign means it's ok, minus means they don't like it and will give you one strike, an X means they hate it and will give you 2 strikes. If you get 3 strikes you lose, if you don't at least select one thing you also lose.</p>\n<p>If you survive the 5 days you will have to pick a character to go out with. <strong>You will only win and get a successful real date if you pick the character that likes you the most!</strong> So it might not be the best idea to make everyone like you.</p>\n<p>If you manage to reach ending take a screenshot to prove it! It seems like I might've made it too hard to win so I'm curious to see successful attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended to download or play in a non-Chrome browser!</strong></p>\r\n\ud83c\udfae Controls\r\n<p><strong>WASD and arrow keys</strong> - Menu movement</p>\n<p><strong>Spacebar </strong>- Selection</p>\n<p><strong>M </strong>- Mute</p>\n<p><strong>F </strong>- Toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p><strong>Esc </strong>- Exit fullscreen</p>\r\n\ud83d\udcd6 Story\r\n<p>Have you ever wondered how hard it is to date in prison? It must be even harder than on the outside, right? The biggest problem is you don't get much time to date in prison. That's why Timmy the cellmate figured out how to make a whole speed dating event in just under a minute. There are five beautifully twisted participants who you will get to meet! <strong>Every 10 seconds</strong> a new person shows up in front of you.</p>\n<p>The event lasts 5 days. In between each day you will get letters from a very dear friend of yours, the garbage man. He will give you hints on what the participants in the event think of you.</p>\r\n\ud83e\uddcd Credits\r\n<ul><li><strong>Design, Programming &amp; Writing</strong> - Krasimir Balchev\u00a0 a.k.a. krasi0707</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Design, Art &amp; Character Vocals</strong> - poopie</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Sound effects besides character vocals</strong> - Freesound.org</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Music</strong> - Tunetank.com</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Fonts</strong> - 1001fonts.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:32:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e22/e22f585ef4248e5a8effcfaf4782cc60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["krasi0707"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
