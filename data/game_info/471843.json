You can't leave a level without it because of a bug)</p><p><strong>WTH is going on:</strong></p>\n<p>- your robot must reach the rainbow PC to steal it's information and open the exit gate.</p>\n<p>- Red things bad.</p>\n<p>- Green platforms are activated when the green button is pressed</p>\n<p>- You may see some bananas (there is a secret in each level)</p>\n<p><strong>Major bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>- Nothing happens when you beat a level. (you must exit manually)</p>\n<p>- You can't touch rainbow PC twice. You'll stick to it.
