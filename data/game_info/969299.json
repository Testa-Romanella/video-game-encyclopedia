You collect items and weapons in the scene to complete the goal. Compared with version 1.0, version 2.0 has more improvements. Including before and during the game, you can choose different characters, choose the scene and size (this function will be added later), set the difficulty more carefully (you can choose the initial number of zombies, regeneration time setting, item richness, difficulty factor, whether to hold weapons at the beginning), and set the day and night rotation and whether to start at night. In the game, the scene settings are more realistic and rich, the character weapons are more abundant, the melee can combo and lock the zombie, and the items that can be used have more functions, etc. Moreover, the game has been better optimized. The content of version 2.0 is richer and better, but the game size is smaller than that of version 1.0, and the requirements for hardware performance are lower.<br/><br/><strong>Game Objective</strong><br/><br/>To Kill all zombies in the scene, it is a simple game.<br/><br/><strong>Key Contradiction</strong><br/><br/>Zombies will double and regenerate after a certain period of time. The more initial zombies, the more doubled, the more difficult it will be. It needs a balanced strategy to spend more time collecting items or killing zombies. The result will not be the same at every start.<br/><br/><strong>Game Rules</strong><br/><br/>1. The game can choose different scenes and sizes. Different scene atmospheres and buildings are different. The larger the scene, the more scattered the items and zombies are, the harder it is to collect items and find zombies.<br/><br/>2. The game can choose to rotate day and night and whether to start at midnight. During the day, the vision is clearer and the atmosphere is relatively less terrible, but the zombie has stronger action ability and runs faster. At night, the vision is not clear, the atmosphere is more terrible, and the flashlight is often needed, but the Zombie's ability to move is weaker and runs slower.<br/><br/>3. In the scene, a certain number of items will be generated in each building, including weapons, bullets, accessories, functional items, etc. items are usually generated only once at the beginning, and they will be gone when used up. Moreover, there is a certain probability of item generation. Whether to generate enough suitable items requires a certain amount of luck.<br/><br/>4. The type of items generated and the distribution of zombies are uncertain, which requires a little luck. If there are enough random items and the types meet the needs, and the zombies are concentrated, the challenge may be completed soon.<br/><br/>5. Special settings are randomly distributed in the scene. Female ghosts, if you encounter them, will bring you assistance. You will know when you encounter them.<br/><br/><strong>Creator Team</strong><br/><br/>This game \"I am not a legend\" is produced by Shenzhen eYang Technology Co., Ltd.
