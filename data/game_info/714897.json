YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR THE MONMOUTHIAN DREAM PROGRAM. AS A TEST SUBJECT, YOU WILL BE SUBJECTED TO THE DREAM WORLD AND BE ASKED TO REPORT ON YOUR FINDINGS.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>MONMOUTHIAN Cell Dream is a Secret Santa fangame that I made for cLOUDDEAD (NO AFFILIATION WITH TRIP HOP GROUP OF SAME NAME), creator of untitled needle game. I made a game like those games, but with my own original gimmick ideas and twists. The requirement was to limit yourself to 3 screens, so this game is short. Please enjoy Monmouth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Please note that this game is not intended for beginners. However, included in the game is \"Dreams Mode\", allowing you to toggle invisibility and change rooms with ease.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:16:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe8/fe815f754ee40bf6ca533880ac51a464.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KG"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
