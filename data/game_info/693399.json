Touch a spike and the game resets back to the first level, so you must guide the chocolate cake to victory by following a door leading to the second level with another door leading to the final level with yet another door leading to victory. If you fall, there is the restart button for you to restart the game.</p><p>Rule: Complete the levels\u00a0WITHOUT cheating on the second and final levels. There will be lots of cheating ways that you cannot do when it comes to the second and\u00a0final levels, e.g\u00a0(Jump as many times as you can, skip the platforms to find the doors, etc).</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Left Arrow Key / A = Left</p><p>Right Arrow Key / D = Right</p><p>Spacebar = Jump</p><p>R = Restart the game</p><p>Credit:</p><p>Acoustic Breeze by Benjamin Tissot\u00a0on Bensound.com</p><p>Congratulations by TibaSound on EnvatoMarket</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T08:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/735/735962edb46a42c076f064173179249c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["N.ChoudStudios01"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
