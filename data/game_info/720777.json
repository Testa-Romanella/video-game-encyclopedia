I've tested it on as old as an 80186 and it works dandy.\u00a0 Same with my 486 and early Pentium machine.\u00a0 Can't guarantee it'll run on an 8086... but it should.</p>\n<p>The game runs in text mode, so any graphics display should be fine (CGA,\u00a0EGA, VGA, WhateverGA should all work).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Simply run LINUXT.EXE and you're good to go!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a free perk for all full subscribers to The Lunduke Journal:</p>\n<p>https://lunduke.substack.com/<br/></p><p>You can purchase the game... but I really recommend simply subscribing to The Lunduke Journal to get it.\u00a0 Linux Tycoon for DOS is not really meant to be a standalone retail title.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:50:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ede/edef8669a08edc0df5b222a9d224e428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Works of Bryan Lunduke"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
