Her mission is straightforward: log in, engage the enemy, and log out. For a warrior of her caliber, it shouldn't be difficult.<br/><br/>However, nothing is simple when one's own mind can be hacked. Upon beginning her mission, Void Girl finds that she had been installed with \"empathy.exe,\" a program which will change her perception of war forever.<br/><br/> <br/><em>The Void Hero Blues</em> is a short subversive cyberpunk first person shooter about the objectification of strangers. It was developed over a semester and a half as a student project. <br/><br/><strong>It is recommended that you set the graphics quality to \"good\" or \"good enough\" on most systems. </strong><strong>Set the resolution to maximum.</strong> Some small bugs are present. Thank you for playing!
