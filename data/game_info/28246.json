Ensnared in a clandestine global power struggle that rages under the cover of conventional war zones in Africa and Asia, players must eliminate a relentlessly evil enemy known only as \u2018The Target\u2019 on behalf of the \u2018Network\u2019. After being dropped into chaotic areas of operations, gamers deploy a mouth-watering selection of contemporary firearms to tear through environments and enemies, chaining kills and earning power ups. Complimented by co-operative and multiplayer modes, BODYCOUNT will set new standards for intense, outrageous arcade action and put the fun back into the FPS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T01:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/54c/54cd5dc11efb009beb50cffb8ba18e13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.53, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 118, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 10, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 81, "ratings_count": 19, "suggestions_count": 594, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 19, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Codemasters", "Fireproof Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
