But can it be improved or at least modernized? My goal was to find out.</p>\n<p>I wanted to keep the essence of the game of chess, mainly the iconic pieces and the idea of strategically thinking ahead.</p>\n<p>In my attempt to modernize this game,\u00a0I realized I was doing something no one wanted and no one would really care about, the ultimate millennial move, hence the game's title.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Drag and drop pieces down onto the board and click play.</p>\n<p>If you click on a piece on the board, you can a list of options including selling, and moving pieces.</p>\n<p>Pieces can only be moved once per round.</p>\n<p>If Pawns are moved 8 times, they can be promoted to any other piece.</p>\n<p>If a piece gets destroyed, it is lost forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Other:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made in less then 48 work hours for the Miz game jam using the 1 bit Kenney art pack.</p>\n<p>This game was originally meant to be a web build, but due to many issues including not getting screen scaling to work with click detection. This game must be downloaded to play and enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:13:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfd3aef5135ab1c3a41e93e6bdd6fcc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["IanGoGo"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
