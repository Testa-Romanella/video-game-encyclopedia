It took us about 2 months (if I count time spent making own launcher with updates because I totally forgot there are sites like itch, thanks God there is!) but I do work full time, so it wasn't all just making this game, but I really enjoyed making it!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Give it a try, it's free, and it doesn't bite :)</strong></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, please write them down in the comments, thank you!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T22:15:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/430/430e1d5b53dbd60b66667a434f7d5e67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["cRaZy92", "Abrakus"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
