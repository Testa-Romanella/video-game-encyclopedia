In order to rescue her, our little Mess has since embarked on this strange journey...<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is an abnormal adventure game in nonsensical style. It contains a variety of game elements (even fighting battles, tank battles, puzzles, sokobans, flying shooting, etc.). It is very suitable to recommend it to friends who you want to prank them, live broadcast, or entertain yourself.<br/><br/><br/><strong><h3>Game Features</h3></strong><br/><br/><ul>There are many levels that are not toe the rules. You must think out of common sense. If you play them in a normal way, you couldn't win. </ul><br/><br/><br/><ul>Numerous faces that want a good smack match the silly design in the game. Yeah, you\u2018d better protect your keyboard and mouse.</ul><br/><br/><br/><ul>Except the adventure mode, other types of game elements can be seen everywhere in this game, such as fighting battle, tank battle, puzzle solving, sokoban, flying shooting and so on. Of cause, they are not toe the rules too, otherwise it will be boring. </ul><br/><br/><br/><ul>This game can convert between 2D and 3D modes and shift the direction of gravity through specific blocks. So you can use these things to pass through some seemingly impossible roadblocks cleverly. </ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>In some levels, you may even need to redefine the rules of the game and win the game based on the rules you just defined. </ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>There are many patterns of death, and some of them are very shocking! </ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><ul>Funny and other style soundtracks created by the music producer YuZiXi will give you a nice game experience.</ul><br/><br/><strong>\ud83d\udc46Want to know more?
