I made it for the gmtkjam 2019. <strong>The main idea was to reference the \"when there is only one piece of pizza left\" meme, but from the viewpoint of the pizza.</strong> I also wanted to introduce some twists in the genre of endless runner. It also serves as a reminder to recycle more and try to minimize waste.<br/></p>\n<p>If you have any critique, feel free to leave me a comment :D</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/>----------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Code and Design by me: Flutterru<br/>Music by: Tristan Drogies</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------<br/>Other Assets used:</p>\n<p>Pizza: Shutterstock<br/>Background: cruizRF<br/>Sprite Effect: best-game-kits<br/>Acid Burn Sound: mikhog Michel Baradari<br/>Ambient Sound: Blender Foundation<br/>Chop/ Jump Sound: dave.des<br/>Recycle Assets: Clint Bellanger<br/>GameOver Font: Pedro M.
