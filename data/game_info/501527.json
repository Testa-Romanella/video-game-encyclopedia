In this game, you have hoarded too many crates in your attic and they are simply too heavy to be supported for much longer! You must remove as much weight\u00a0as you can in the limited time\u00a0to keep your attic from collapsing. Do this by carrying crates to the top or bottom deposit sections, but bear in mind that different crates have different weights, and the more reinforced\u00a0the crate is and looks, the slower you will move when carrying it!</p><p>NOTE: The crate placements and weights are randomized each game. Don't expect the same score every time!</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\nWASD or Arrow KeysMove up, left, down, and right.RDrop the crate you are carrying.Collide With CratePick up the crate and carry it to the top or bottom to get rid of it.\r\nABOUT\r\n<p>This game was made in just under 3 hours for\u00a0Trijam #89 with the theme\u00a0<em>Remove it!</em> My friend recently introduced me to the incredible game Wilmot's Warehouse, which you can check out\u00a0here, and I loved it, so\u00a0I took a ton of inspiration from that and put a little spin on it to make this game! I created all the visuals and sound effects\u00a0myself using Adobe Illustrator and Bfxr, respectively, and I got the awesome background music free from\u00a0www.fesliyanstudios.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c3/0c308b262b660cb685be97a468555ecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harrison Rooney"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
