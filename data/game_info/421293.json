Feel free to\u00a0download\u00a0and play this\u00a0<strong>FREE GAME</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The main purpose of this game</strong>\u00a0is to run as long as you can while the running speed will build up slowly based on the distance you traveled and\u00a0it will be harder to avoid differtent objects. Try to <strong>avoid rocks, trunks and animals</strong> on your way, if you smash into them you will explode. At this time you can collect some 'power ups' like a magnet to attract more coins easily or a bottle to blast\u00a0through rocks and trunks.\u00a0Also it is possible to kill the animals by sliding into them, but be carefull because they can attack you too.</p>\n<p>While running your traveled distance is recorded together with the coins you collect. The traveled distance and collected coins are\u00a0<strong>saved online</strong>\u00a0to create a TOP 5 of best players (whenever there will be more active players the list might be extended).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T03:15:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c61/c6119d65def1e621d0549c7c04409178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RunOrExplode"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
