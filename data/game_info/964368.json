{"id": 964368, "slug": "justwatchmycat", "name": "JustWatchMyCat", "name_original": "JustWatchMyCat", "description": "JustWatch MyCat is a puzzle game that manipulates blocks of cats to eat fish. When you press the arrow keys, the cats move in that direction all at once on a 2-d map. In addition, new gimmicks appear every 10 stages, and there are a total of 50 stages.<br/><br/><strong>Cat Block</strong>: Move in unison in the direction entered until blocked in that direction. Cat blocks bite the fish in their mouth when they touch it.<br/><br/><strong>Puffer fish</strong>: When a cat block touches the puffer fish, the cat becomes addicted. You can heal by eating regular fish blocks. At this time, the cat blocks don't bite the fish in its mouth. In other words, cat blocks that ate puffer fish are only satisfied by eating two blocks of fish.<br/><br/><strong>Switches and gates</strong>: Open or close the gates on the map when a block steps on the pink switch. However, passing over the switch is not applicable and there must be a block on the switch at the end of the movement. A closed gate acts like a wall.<br/><br/><strong>Dog Block</strong>: Dog blocks move in unison in the opposite direction of the input direction. If a dog block and a cat block compete for position with one space left when they collide face to face, the cat block takes its place. Dog blocks can operate the switch, but they do not interact with regular fish or puffer fish.<br/><br/><strong>Portal</strong>: Portal always appears in pairs. When a cat or dog block touches one portal, it sends it in the opposite direction of the other.<br/><br/><strong>Cute Cat Photos</strong>: Provides cat photos for every multiples stage of 10. In fact, one of the reasons I made this game is because I want more people to see my cat.<br/><br/>If the game is too difficult, you can also skip it by pressing the space or enter key. However, it is made up of puzzles that can be solved with a little thought, so I recommend you to try it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T04:13:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d09c03b105799bc444fcd00c0ed4ccbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CalmDV"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CalmDV"], "esrb_rating": null}
