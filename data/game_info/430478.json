Each movement of your card creates a unique and challenging situation, a mini-puzzle which requires strategic thinking to solve.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this card roguelike, you move your character card about a field of nine cards. You have to clash your card with neighboring cards to move it. Monster cards and trap cards will decrease your card's health, healing cards will... well, heal you, cards with gold will increase your game score and there are also many other cards with unique abilities and behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is built with a classical roguelike formula: it is a turn-based dungeon crawler in a fantasy setting with selectable characters, procedurally generated dungeons, pixel art graphics, and the permadeath.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose one of the ten heroes, descend into the magical dungeon and slay hordes of monsters in quest of epic loot!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-02T19:42:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/755/75589b279855aa1fd9f949816d4b60e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["717 pixels"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["717 pixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
