Mothra, Hedorah, and Baragon along with King Ghidorah are added to the line up, and are joined by Rodan. This game, released in place of an earlier announced game meant to star Rodan, was received poorly by audiences, due in part to a lack of a genuine plot, and due to the game having an extremely arbitrary style of combat, which was difficult for many players to understand. It was the third Godzilla game for a Nintendo system to be released in North America, after Godzilla: Monster of Monsters for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Godzilla for Nintendo Game Boy.</p>\n<p>It would be followed by Super Godzilla for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993.</p>\n<p>The game is also infamous for being one of the few North American released NES games where the developer is unknown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-18T15:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5e/b5e1cc80eb9f2b5362a8f071f278fba3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 235, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Unknown", "Toho"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Toho"], "esrb_rating": null}
