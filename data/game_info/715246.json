We certainly need more of you around in our lives.\u00a0 But for those who love to think bigger, and see the world as an opportunity for boundless creative innovation at any level, thanks for meeting me at this point in my journey.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>This is the first of many games I'll make, and the first of many sh**ty games I'll make, but it would mean the world to me if you supported me at the beginning. I've given away a lot of free content throughout my creative journey, and I'm just now learning how to value the work I put in.\u00a0 If you're a fellow creative I'm sure you understand.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Try it out and if you like it, let me know what you loved, and if you didn't, let me know what could have been improved. Much love out there and keep making sh*t.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:40:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a69502e59c780b0862812c2c9d701582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vinny Casasanta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
