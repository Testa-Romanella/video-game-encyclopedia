One process might only allow ever higher values from your dice, while another process only allows specific numbers. <br/><br/>As you fill spaces, fill entire lines, or even over time as your wine ages, you score emblems representing your wine\u2019s characteristics, such as acidity, body, sweetness, and tannins. Each of these characteristics has their own scoring track, which means that points get added or deducted differently per the type of emblem you score.<br/><br/>Each of the processes are connected \u2013 doing well in one process makes your life easier down the line, but it\u2019s just as easy to put up roadblocks for yourself. Each process contains several spaces that are linked to other spaces in other processes; fill one such space, and automatically fill the other. Fill a connected space with a difficult value, and you might accidentally lock yourself out of progress in that process!<br/><br/>Finally, there is a fairly pressing matter: if you haven\u2019t pressed your wine before the end of the last round, there is no wine to score! Balance your efforts in the other processes with the dice you put into pressing your wine, the final round starts before you know it, and you might be left without the dice needed to finish!<br/><br/>(Then again, press your wine too early and lose out on precious points.)<br/><br/>Depending on how the dice fall, get ready to make Pour Decisions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T08:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77a/77afdd39ba6b385d480c1678acb3528a_k8dDaUb.jpg", "website": "https://erisapps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Eris"], "genres": ["RPG", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Eris"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
