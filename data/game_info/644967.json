{"id": 644967, "slug": "water-bottle-falls", "name": "Water Bottle Falls", "name_original": "Water Bottle Falls", "description": "<p>It's a little known fact that most hot water bottles are great thrill seekers.\r\n</p>\n<p>Ever since they discovered the secret waterfall behind the cave, they've been having the time of their lives, seeing how far downstream they can get...\r\n</p>\n<p>Tubby wants to join in, too. Help Tubby become the best bottle surfer he can be!\r\n</p>\n<p>Yes, this really is a game about guiding a hot water bottle down a waterfall, discovering secrets and winning trophies. Because there still aren't enough games about hot water bottles.\r\n</p>\n<p>This was a work in progress for about half a year. I can't describe how much (metaphorical) sweat and tears this cost me, though it certainly doesn't look it. There's still a couple of glitches (let me know if you find any!) but for now I'm just glad I was able to finish it.\u00a0It's also the first game I've made that takes longer than five minutes to play. Comments and feedback are always welcome.</p>\n<p>*NOTE* Sometimes the music doesn't play correctly in the demo version if you're using Firefox. So far I haven't been able to fix this, so it's probably best to use another browser for now.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a250f2e71f207f8deb3a27cc22cbcc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["WixeyWinsock"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
