Who has changed you. Restless seekers, bustling, endeavoring, zealously and always busy. Their origin is the same, but their paths are not.<br/><br/><br/><br/>R\u014cA is a cryptic single-player first-person play on awareness and fugacity. Somewhere between life and dream, we are an observer of our own experience. The journey is the destination here, a challenge not everyone is ready for. Chasing meaning in the void.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The Look and Feel</strong><br/><br/>Atmospheric Experimental Glitch Pixel-Art Artgame Colorful Peaceful Relaxing First-Person Weird Surreal<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>While in many games the beings are eliminated by clicks, in R\u014cA you put them at rest or awake them again. Choose their pose and position from a wide range of options. Are you playing them? Are they playing you? This sometimes also induces some side effects in a certain order. There are two possible endings. One has to chase or catch the moment attentively to see something splendid appear.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While emotions can coexist, they often wipe each other out. As humor or plain thrill will detract from certain subjects, thought and sense are their big parts. Are you open to the uncommon, in wonder watching the stars, maybe going to museums sometimes? Then the game might be notable for you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>q u e s t i o n s\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0blush @ arquoia . com<br/><br/>\r\nt w i t t e r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@ARQUOIA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db9/db9482547c831c31e5d0d17bef0719e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ARQUOIA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
