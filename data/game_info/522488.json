Explore a creepy mansion which definitely doesn't have an implausibly large underground laboratory in the basement! Survive and save the world! <br/></p>\n<p>Any similarities to extant franchises, living or dead, is purely coincidental. Please don't sue me.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Demo release made for Revision Jam II. The game isn't as complete or balanced as I would have liked, but I committed to releasing a demo so here it is. The game is pretty hard, and has just endless repetetive floors.<br/></p><p>Development is ongoing. Please leave any feedback in the comment section.</p>\n\n<p>A note on font/graphical rendering: During development I've been using Consolas which works pretty well, but I can't redistribute that. Some other fonts have issues with character alignment given the way I'm drawing on a grid, particularly around box drawing characters. After testing a few options, I'm using Ubuntu Mono as a good free option for the demo but it's not perfect. Longer term I need to switch to another system, probably bitmapped characters I have proper control over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T05:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d76/d76623ffc3a8135536b1e5153ff04db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["mrhthepie"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
