During the parkour process, there will be many obstacles. At this time, you need to move left and right to select the correct block to break through the obstacles. There will be an arithmetic problem on each round of obstacles, and you need to calculate the answer to this problem in a short time and then control the character to move to the square with the correct answer. Every time you pass an obstacle, you will get a score bonus. Come and challenge your highest score!<h3>Game introduction</h3>The game as a whole does not require too high an operation, but it requires responsiveness, and you need to make the right choice in a short time to get a high score. As for how to choose the correct square, it is not necessarily necessary to calculate the correct answer, and the method of elimination can also be used. If you want to improve your reaction ability, the reaction speed mainly depends on the characteristics of human receptors (vision, hearing) and other analyzers, as well as the coordination relationship between the central nervous system and neuromuscular. The quality of reaction speed is greatly affected by genetic effects. For example, the reaction time of a person without special training is usually between 0.2 and 0.3 seconds, while a well-trained athlete can only reach 0.1 to 0.2 seconds. If you want to reach the level of an athlete, you can play more. games!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T02:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/820c5357a70d9e22148adfcbd249eb56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Math"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Math"], "esrb_rating": null}
