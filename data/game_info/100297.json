Thanks to Construct 2's reliable features, we don't think there should be too many problems, but we are aware there is a certain risk involved when downloading software that hasn't even been tested on its target platform yet. We apologize for the inconvenience. We got so involved with getting the game finished that we didn't think through the Linux aspect of deployment.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSo what do you do? Reach out to us on Twitter! We're looking for people to test the Linux build and will gladly gift you a copy of the game during this interim time while we're testing Linux deployment.
