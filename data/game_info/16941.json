The game is played from the first person; you will see the world through the eyes of king\u2019s daughter, who was overthrown by the brutal Iron Lord. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe selected Steam Punk as a style of the game, which means that you will find many interesting puzzles, interactions with objects and mechanisms. The player will have to escape from the air prison, find the Great Prophet in magic forest, reveal the secret of the Iron Lord, sneak into his citadel and rid Namariel from cruel tyrant. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe tried to invent something new, for example there is \u201cmind reading device\u201d in the gameplay; by using this item you\u2019ll be able to divine thoughts of characters, who are unable to communicate with you. Also you will have a robot assistant at your disposal, his name is Jim, he will help you in solving quests, and also, from time to time you\u2019ll be able to switch controls of both main character and Jim to walk through levels with his assistance. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLarge game world, many magnificent locations and lots of pleasant animation; by the way, animation is what we are especially proud of, because we are a small studio, but we really wanted to do our best in terms of quality, so that you would like it. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn spite of the linear gameplay, at the same time there is a freedom in choosing several quests to resolve, not connected among themselves, we don\u2019t lead you by the hand, giving you rein to choose. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDozens of brain-teasers, mini-games and innovative solutions, ranging from simple mini-games in two moves to advanced mode mini-games, where help of your assistant may be needed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T08:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5bd/5bdf71807d40d63ba12a90ceabe27589.jpg", "website": "http://www.shamangs.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 254, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 427, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Shaman Games Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["PlayRIX"], "esrb_rating": null}
