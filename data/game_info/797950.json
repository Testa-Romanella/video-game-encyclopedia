In the beginning there will be a small shop on your ranch where you can buy and sell. If you have earned some money, you can buy your own stall in the nearest town.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut with the starting tools, it would take ages to earn enough money. Therefore you can upgrade tools as well as your fields. With such upgrades, your fields will become larger and your tools more powerful.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T04:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4d48fe0d7975f75a95dd385af590cef.jpg", "website": "https://dream-studios.net/Ranchlife/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DreamStudios"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DreamStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
