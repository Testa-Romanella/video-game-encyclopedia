The theme was \"Balance\".</p>\n<p>Try to eat as much food as you can. Each item gives you points. While eating, take care about your <strong>health </strong>and your <strong>mood</strong>. Some food gives good health, others good mood. Keeping both <strong>balanced </strong>gives you a <strong>score-multiplier</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Green Food is good for health, others good for mood</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Be careful</strong>: If your health and your mood are too unbalanced, you will get negative points!
