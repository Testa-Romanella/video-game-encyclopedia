We scoped ambitiously and didn't get to everything we wanted, so there may be bugs or evidence of planned features like head modules and hamster abilities.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\nConcept\r\n<p>You control two hamsters, and through them, a giant mech!</p>\n<p>The mech consists of five parts:</p>\n<ul><li>A left and right arm for weapons</li><li>A core module that controls the mech's shields and rotation at the hips</li><li>A leg module that controls the mech's movement</li><li>A head module that can perform special abilities (not implemented)</li></ul>\n<p>A module will stop functioning without <strong>energy. </strong>Send\u00a0a\u00a0hamster\u00a0to\u00a0that\u00a0module\u00a0to\u00a0spin\u00a0the hamster\u00a0wheel\u00a0and\u00a0produce\u00a0more energy!</p>\n<p>You cannot control modules that do not currently have a hamster in them. Unpiloted modules will simply continue to do what they were doing, as long as they have energy.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>To move a hamster, click on the hamster's details panel, then click on the module in the mech map.<br/></p>\n<p>To control a module, click on the module in the mech map, then use the dial, sliders and buttons on the module details panel. Keep in mind you can only use the controls while a hamster is in the room!</p>\n<p>You can <strong>pause time\u00a0</strong>by pressing P. This lets you send orders to hamsters and adjust settings on the mech that will take effect once time is unpaused.</p>\n<p>At the start of each level, you have the chance to upgrade equipment on your mech. Interact with a module console to purchase an upgrade --- but be aware it costs <strong>cheddar, </strong>which you can only get by slaying enemies.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Zebulah:\u00a0</strong>Programming, combat\u00a0design</p>\n<p><strong>plasmastarfish: </strong>Programming, hamster portrait art<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Airborne_Manatee: </strong>UI art</p>\n<p><strong>PinkLemon8</strong><strong>: </strong>Player, enemy, environment art and character animation.</p>\n<p><strong>TizianMusic</strong><strong>: </strong>Music, SFX</p>\n<p><strong>superduperpacman42:</strong> Additional programming<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T21:28:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad3/ad3ae641b1bc0ae13c7556be655b1d15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["plasmastarfish", "superduperpacman42", "Zebulah", "Airborne_Manatee", "TizianMusic", "PinkLemon8"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
