The main gamemode is Tag. One player is selected after a grace period and has a bomb placed on their head. The objective is to pass the bomb onto another player before you explode. Last player standing wins! Infection is our secondary mode. One player is selected at the start of the game. Similar to tag, the selected player has a bomb which they must pass onto other players. However, instead of giving them the bomb, the player infects the other players. Infect all the players to win or be the last person standing to win. Our 3rd mode is Hide &amp; Seek. One player is selected to be the Seeker. The other players have 10 seconds to hide. Hiders will have a slower speed to encourage hiding on the maps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur game also features Player Customization. Customize your player\u2019s shirt, pants and shoes to be whatever colour you desire! Hats are available in the store for purchase and a free one is given to all players.
