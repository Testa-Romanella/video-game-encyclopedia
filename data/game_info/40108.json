The gameplay is very heavy on physics and features a back then pretty novel object cutting mechanism. It also comes rendered in a comic-book like art style.</p>\n<p>Please note that the state of the prototype doesn't reflect the quality of the later commercial release Tiny &amp; Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. It's a proof-of-concept for the game mechanics and the art style. If you like it, please consider buying the follow-up, because it works much better in every way!</p>\n\n\n<p>See the README.TXT for controls and help.
