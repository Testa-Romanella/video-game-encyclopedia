Inside it are paintings and texts created using artificial intelligences.\u00a0 The work uses three generative adversarial networks (GANs) working in tandem:</p>\n<ol><li>The first GAN (StyleGan) creates an infinitely varied set of paintings in the style of abstract 20th century art.</li><li>The paintings are then shown to a second GAN (Yolov3). Yolov uses object detection to name the objects in the paintings, which are then used to generate a descriptive phrase in fairly grammatical English.</li><li>This descriptive phrase is then fed into a third GAN (GPT2) which creates\u00a0a short description of the work\u2019s history and (imaginary) artists involved. This network\u00a0 has been trained on the descriptions of various modern art museums.</li></ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The gallery is then procedurally created using Unity.\u00a0In the gallery space itself, nothing repeats. Code controls the selection of artworks, the camera, and the 3D models. The audio is an abstracted soundscape of server farms-- fans and rhythmic mechanical pulsing.</p>\n<p><em>Telephone Paintings\u00a0</em>is an ongoing\u00a0work by Steven Sych\u00a0and Timothy Thomasson. The work is dedicated to Bauhaus artist\u00a0L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946).</p>\n<p>\u201cI was not afraid of losing the \u201cpersonal touch\u201d so highly valued in previous painting. On the contrary, I even gave up signing my paintings. I put numbers and letters with the necessary data on the back of the canvas, as if they were cars, airplanes, or other industrial products.\u201d</p><p>-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (1944)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44c/44c2548a84edd1c34ed4c555769eec8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["spelafort"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
