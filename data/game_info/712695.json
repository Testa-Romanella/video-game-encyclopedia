Both games are solid \"conventional\" RPGs (i.e. top-down view, lots of loot and monsters) which emphasizes level advancement and typical \"kill the big foozle\" endgame.\n<br/><br/>\nIn Demon's Winter, you must search the lands and seas for spells to trap the demon-god Malifon and undo his mystical curse. Entertaining and very well-written, if not revolutionary.", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f31890d8779c084e6f6ea2673e849960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["SSI"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["SSI"], "esrb_rating": null}
