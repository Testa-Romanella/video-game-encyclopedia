However, all of this sleepy charm disguises a dark secret.<br/><br/>There are many murderous stories that never hit the front pages of the Bateman Hills Observer, but live as whispers among the town's inhabitants. Far more than local legends, these occurrences are the work of Mayor Bateman. The town takes its name from his lumberjack ancestor, and Mayor Bateman will stop at nothing to ensure that his community\u2019s reputation remains pristine.<br/><br/>However, sins do no stay buried, and the mound of murdered and forgotten bodies has grown too large. These wronged souls have returned from the grave to bring the truth behind their deaths to life.<br/><br/>Desperate to keep his wicked deeds a secret, the Mayor makes a deal with the deceased: defeat his champions in the log jamming tournament, and not only can they reveal his actions to the world, but he will surrender his beloved town to them. But if they lose, these vengeful spirits must serve as exhibits in a new haunted hotel tourist attraction, further adding to Bateman Hills\u2019s appeal. With a chance to reveal the truth in the balance, the undead agree.<br/><br/><strong>Let's Jam.</strong><strong>Catch This !</strong><br/>Compete in fast paced axe throwing action. Choose one of eight bodacious characters and go head to head across eight unique home fields for each competitor. Once you are saddled up on your log, try to get the axe past your opponent in order to rack up points. The first one to score 11 takes a set in this best of 5 battle. Use quick dodges to get to the axe with haste, and then time your throw just right to counter it right back in their face! Collect power ups as they appear on the field to give yourself a boost to your throwing ability, or unlock a dangerous power throw. If that wasn't enough for you take it over to Cheerleader mode, where fans of the competitors block the goals. The only way to bury the hatchet is going to be through them. Stuck playing alone?
