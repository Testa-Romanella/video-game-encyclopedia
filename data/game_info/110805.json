But watch out, colliding with the wrong baddie shape will immediately send you back into 3D mode where you can take damage!<br/>Tips:<br/>You can move underneath obstacles when in 2D/Shape mode, just like the baddies.<br/>If you find yourself clicking off the game window too often while dashing, try using the space bar to dash.</p><p>Programmers:<br/>Cooper @zerocooldev<br/>Ryan<br/>Lucas @devmasao<br/>Miguel</p><p>Artist:<br/>Danny https://www.instagram.com/dsmokes/</p><p>ALL ART ASSETS for this game where created by the artist on an iPad using the Procreate painting app.</p><p>Audio and Effects were a mix of homemade and https://incompetech.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3eb62a14f73a9d42cfe05b7d047ad8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ChummyWinds"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
