The game lets you jump on top of buildings, take out burger joints and gun down enemy jetpack-troopers and tanks. Battle your way across the American continent to avenge your girlfriend Rosa, who ended up as a Captain Patriot\u2122 hamburger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The game is a classic  love story about Moonalisa, who fell for her herd mate, Rosa. The two would have lived happily ever after (and this game would have been a cow dating sim instead) if not for an unfortunate event involving a hungry farmer and a meat grinder. After the \"accident\" Moonalisa was, naturally, rather pissed. After all, how would you feel if someone made a hamburger out of your girlfriend? Yeah, thought so. <br/><br/>She decided that all humans were at fault for allowing this atrocity to happen, and did the only thing she could think of to numb the pain: She somehow grew a pair of hands, stood up on her hind legs and grabbed a hold of a conveniently placed machinegun. The rest is a real barn burner, but it is up to you to guide Moonalisa, the bovine berserker, on her road to end human civilization in what the Mayans prophesized as the Cowpocalypse.Features<ul><li><strong>Fully desctructible environments</strong>, blow up buildings, bad guys and baby strollers<br/></li><li><strong>Survival mode</strong> unlock upgrades to both your cow and your guns in survival mode and see just how much money has been wasted on Animal Control.<br/></li><li><strong>End the reign of the meat eaters</strong> and have fun doing so!
