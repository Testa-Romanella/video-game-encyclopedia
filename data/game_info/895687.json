It was written in Lua using the pico-8 game fantasy console. It has gameplay like wordle or mastermind. I'm aware the game is very hard with only 4 guesses per lock but have fun and challenge yourself and try to top your friends and get into the local hall of fame. I planned to add more but just didn't have the time.\u00a0 But I am happy with the final product of the game as it's in a working state with little to no known bugs. If you find any, please let me know in the comments on this page :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:55:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e03d163cfbd602cf6f2b0f93527b12b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jaychkub"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
