A few things to note:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Many parts are still being worked on, especially in the Extras menu.</li><li>This is just the pure VN demo- meaning, the RPG battles are not implemented. When the full demo releases to the public, you will be able to pick if you want to play the pure VN or the RPG VN.</li><li>The demo skips around days to better give a idea for what the plot of the full game will be- specifically, you start at the opening of the full game and then jump to day 9 and then day 11.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Kotachi received a pair of white revolvers after his grandfather died, forged from the constellation Perseus. His weapons target specters, shadow monsters that invisibly attack people... and the Zodiac. As one of the few who can, it's up to Kotachi to both protect these constellations and use their powers in battle to keep everyone safe.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Asterism</em>\u00a0at its heart is a story-heavy turn based RPG inspired by astronomy elements, namely the constellations that make up our sky- especially the Zodiac. It can be played in either the base game, an RPG with battles and visual novel style dialogue, or as a pure visual novel with battle cut-ins rather than turn-based fighting. Choices accompany many of the dialogue menus in both play styles, and can determine how side characters end up by the end of the story- including an optional male love interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Full Game Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>10+ hours of gameplay</li><li>2 playmodes- pure visual novel and RPG + visual novel dialogue</li><li>Branching dialogue trees</li><li>Optional male love interest</li></ul>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Twitter\u00a0 \u00a0\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0Discord\u00a0 \u00a0\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0Newsletter\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:46:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ff/1ff4bbe814b3f3a1ea4bb5c7a0b7c459.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Crystal Game Works"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
