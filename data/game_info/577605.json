The coke you are smuggling has street valve of $11.2 Million and have now been spotted by US Border Patrol who are now giving chase. You have 100 seconds to get $11.2 Million worth of coke into the US and out run Border Patrol. Every crash will cause you to lose 8 Kilos as well as decrease your time. Good Luck and hope you don\u2019t have to get a visit from El Pescador (he is a complete psychopath and loves to force his victims to listen to Justin Bieber, Creed, Limp Bizkit and Nickelback for hours on end).\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Space: Gas</p>\n<p>Left Arrow: Left</p>\n<p>Right Arrow: Right</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T09:52:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06a/06a6d92da6efaa40d468b0b5d2513b57.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oldcrow0999"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
