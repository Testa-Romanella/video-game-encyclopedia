Taking inspiration from how changes in lighting can completely transform a scene in CG and the different camera views we implemented in previous projects, our characters Dusk(black) and Dawn(white) see the world differently. Out on a quest, our characters are trying to reach home and working together to solve obstacles they may find on the way. They will find enemies along the way as well as some helpful polygons that will give them extra powers. (Enemies are shapeless blobs inspired by concave polygons - that make our life harder - and powerups have concrete shapes). You can switch between the two characters by pressing LeftShift. Use this functionality to help Dawn and Dusk get home for some well needed rest after a\u00a0very grueling 4 months.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>For added difficulty (or was it a witch's curse), in the last level (Polygons Galore City), Dawn can only see 2 feet ahead while Dusk's controls are switched (Right Arrow -&gt; Go Left, Left Arrow -&gt; Go Right) and the world is upside down.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T06:43:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdb/bdbf262c357e1b53c6641bf30d09cae1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aliinaa"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
