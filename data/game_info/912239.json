In this game, players take on the role of Ortheo as he takes a break from his adventures to play a game of \"Star Shuffle.\" The objective is to beat your opponent by playing cards with types that beat theirs (Fire beats Grass, Water beats Fire, and Grass beats Water). With a deck of 13 cards, players must strategize and use the knowledge of the remaining cards to infer what cards their opponent may have in their hand. The game is available now on Itch.Io and we will continue to work on it in our free time while developing \"Ortheo: Voyage,\" the sequel to the original game. Be sure to check back for updates as we plan to add features such as Multiplayer, a scoreboard, and more. Play \"Ortheo: Star Shuffle\" and test your card-playing skills today.</p>\n\n<p>Ortheo: Star Shuffle began as a 24-hour project, inspired by the beloved Club Penguin minigame, Card-Jitsu. Unfortunately, that game is now lost to time, but the team at Larsonsoft was determined to pay homage to it in some way. Thus, Ortheo: Star Shuffle was born. The game may be simple, but it's a love letter to a classic and a chance to bring some of the nostalgia back. Though the game was made in just 24 hours, the team may come back and add features such as multiplayer and a scoreboard in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T11:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/256/256fe92389762267fa751c18fe60e382.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dallen Larson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
