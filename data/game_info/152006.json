This isn't really a good game, but I'm uploading it to show how I started out for some friends of mine and compare it to what I can make now. So be careful if you do play it, not everything will run smoothly!</p><p>This is a horizontal shooter about a dude named Rai. He has a suit that allows him to use 4 different attacks that he can level up by collecting Triangles from enemies. These attacks include a fast lightning shot, a hard-hitting flamethrower, a sound attack that produces bouncing waves, and an ice attack that breaks into multiple shards.</p><p>There's also a speed up feature so you can fly through the levels faster in case you want to get a move on things. Be warned as it can quickly turn the tides against you. Rai can also dash but don't use it on an enemy/boss, sometimes it can crash your game...but you'll need it to become invincible to avoid obstacles briefly.</p><p>RaiGear can be very difficult (mainly due to the fact I was young and didn't have a good grip on coding nor at applying difficulty curves). Dying will mean losing all of your powers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daeca7455c0a4f10892b02977236c60b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LucasMaxBros"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
