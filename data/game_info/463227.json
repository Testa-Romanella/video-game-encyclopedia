And when the usual system breaks, it's up to you to manually save and sort people's pets under the scrutiny of your Manager.</p>\n\n<p>This game is meant to be short and simple and not very challenging. It was born from a prompt my friend sent to me, being a \"social media game where you download baby animals under a time limit\". I hope you have fun with it. ^_^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T04:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fdc/fdc00e3a2339ddc9888d9d78fd93c00f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dawn Nyan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
