He enjoys finding troubles - and solving them, but when woke up on a spaceship it was too much even for him. Alone on the ship he had no idea how to pilot, among heaps of weird devices created by a schizophrenic engineer.<br/><br/>Tardy is a quest about fiddling with computers, terminals gadgets and other hi-tech scrap of all sorts. Deal with crazy machines, solve the mystery of the crew disappearance and help Ramto to come back home!<br/><br/><ul><li>Do you like conspiracy theories? Start making them up then! The crew is gone, the ship seems to hate you, the Galaxy is engulfed by war and is teeming with traitors.<br/></li><li>Haven\u2019t cried for a while? You\u2019re going to see children dying, characters murdered, and the ending will make you weep (well, not all of you, but still).<br/></li><li>Feel carsick wearing VR-glasses? You won\u2019t need them to immerse into the game. All the buttons, switches and terminals are as good as real.<br/></li><li>Enjoy playing quests but tired of find-the-item and run-around-the-location things? If you don\u2019t want to combine banana peel to a hammer in your inventory, Tardy is the game you\u2019ve been looking for! <br/></li><li>Pixel art still doesn\u2019t make you cry blood? Wonderful! Moreover, ours is pleasing to the eye. Just like our music is pleasing to the ear.<br/></li><li>Tardy costs a bit more than the average sandwich. We can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t bought it yet!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-18T06:39:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/3057f7ca21e863faae8edfebeeea3de6.jpg", "website": "http://onewingcicada.com/", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 102, "beaten": 13, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["One Wing Cicada"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Drageus Games", "One Wing Cicada"], "esrb_rating": null}
