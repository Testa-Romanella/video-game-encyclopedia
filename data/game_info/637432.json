As our bodies increase their range of sensorial abilities through advancements in healthcare and wearable technologies, climate change is simultaneously redefining our expectations of future environments.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nExamples include the ability to see within the near infrared spectrum of light, access layers of augmented reality, hear plants communicate in low frequency sound or the ability to empathize with those who\u2019s senses differ from your own. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nArchitecture\u2019s shape is less of an objective form and more of a spectrum of sensorial shapes layered upon one another for those with varying access. Much like a radio dial, occupying the same space might not mean you\u2019re tuned to the same architecture...leading to immense creativity as well as public space to potentially fragment even further. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game was installed as part of the 17th International Architecture Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T02:11:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618293827402b7ab1f491a47697e5da0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fruits of Yggdrasil", "Sean Lally Architecture"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Sean Lally Architecure"], "esrb_rating": null}
