Each new world will have 3-6 routes, along with an estimated 40+ hours of content per DLC, just like Obsession. Each world will continue the Particles story in an entirely new setting. See the meta images under Gallery for some examples of how this works in game.<h3>Obsession - Summary:</h3>Reality as we know it may be collapsing in on itself, because of one single human woman. The mysterious Guardians of Reality must investigate this matter urgently, determine the root cause, and either find a solution or destroy this segment of reality before things spiral out of control and the entire universe is destroyed!<br/><br/><br/>But that's neither here nor there. This is a game about alternate universes and the alternative realities therein. <br/><br/>You play the main character of multiple versions (aka Routes) of multiple clusters of reality (aka Worlds, like Obsession!). The characters around you will always be the same people, but the worlds will vary wildly.<br/><br/>But... what does any of this have to do with you destroying reality?!<h3>Characters:</h3><br/><br/>You're a troubled, miserable, college student trying to live life on her own for the first time. You have two great friends, though they each have their flaws, and a brother, who you'd........... rather not talk about. Don't even ask about Mom &amp; Dad. It's not pretty.<br/><br/><br/>One day, a handsome stranger enters your life, and he doesn't want to leave. He likes you. He wants you. He needs you. He writes bad poetry about you. He is your soulmate. Your fate. Whether you like it or not. ... Do you like it... or not?<br/><br/>Sebastian has a twin brother, who's lives a non-traditional hedonistic lifestyle. He cares about his brother a lot, and his brother wants you.<br/><br/>Julian is your co-worker. He's an asshole and a jerk, yet... on rare occasions, can also be very kind, respectful, and affection. He has a strange yet beautiful dragon tattoo that holds some special meaning to him. It's no secret that he likes you, but... he's hiding something. Something big.<br/><br/>Brandon is an external content patch. See the forums after release for more details.<br/><br/>You grew up with your brother in a house full of crime, pain, and trauma. Brandon was the only one who saw you, loved you, and protected you. Your parents kept you isolated, abusing and neglecting you while praising and supporting him... and while grooming him to takeover the mafia family and training him to be a skilled murderer, businessman, and assassin. <br/><br/>The more they tried to separate you, the closer you grew. You needed each other. Is it any wonder that the trauma brought you closer together in unhealthy ways?<br/><br/>Your best friend and roommate. He's gender-fluid, bisexual, carefree, happy, trustworthy, kind, loving, and a party animal. But... there's a lot of pain behind those eyes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T03:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/308/308d85e56d3f337a247c12dc5e3a190b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arewar Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Arewar Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
