{"id": 861786, "slug": "time-attack-rally", "name": "Time Attack Rally", "name_original": "Time Attack Rally", "description": "Game Description:\r\n<p>A classic arcade influenced time attack race game with procedural generation of rewards, obstacles and boosts... stretched out over a 3.6km('ish) track with increasingly further checkpoints and eventually a finish line at the end. Grab the green orbs for points &amp; Nitrous bottles for speed boosts racing through the\u00a0checkpoints for more time, all while avoiding unforgiving\u00a0obstacles that change every race.</p>\n<p>Compete for high scores, top speeds... or both!<br/>Oh... Did I mention you have no brakes??</p>\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n<p>This game is UNFISHISHED!!! This beta has only 1 car, and 1 track... but it is in a fully playable state, start to finish, and I could really use some feedback on gameplay difficulty.</p>\n<p>Comment constructive feedback below or join my discord to discus:\u00a0https://discord.gg/hyh7HwBz7Q</p>\r\n\r\nPlans To Come:\r\n<ul><li>3 main cars to choose from,\u00a0each with different qualities.</li><li>3 main tracks (at least) with different themes and obstacles</li><li>Local scoreboard for\u00a0High Score, Top Speed &amp; Most Time Left</li><li>Submission and viewing of World scoreboards (potential feature)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nDev Storytime:\r\n<p>What started as a learning prototype\u00a0quickly expanded past my lesson\u00a0into more of a fleshed out game system, with even more ideas in my mind. It became reasonable to move from gray box land and\u00a0add some spruced up graphics, sounds and effects to make repeatable testing more pleasing. Soon the game became a bit addicting, both to work on and to play. More things were added and more visuals to include land and decorations past the track. I still have a few more\u00a0plans to implement... and a defined end goal to achieve.</p>\n<p>(\u00a92022 Chris 'TWiG' Jelen &amp;\u00a0Steaming Pile of Games.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T09:13:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a3/2a335253923d5f03e60986d774485ca6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Twig"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
