You start in a monochromatic world, with nothing but shades of grey surrounding you. But fear not, as your mission is to bring color and life to this dreary world.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Basics:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>E to interact</p>\n<p>\"1\" and \"2\" to switch tools (when unlocked).<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Chroma Coater (Paint blaster):<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left Click to paint white tiles with blue paint that makes the floor bouncy and gives the player a jump boost<br/></p>\n<p>Right Click to paint white tiles with orange paint that gives a dramatic speed increase while standing on it</p>\n<p>Touching blue tiles at high velocities will fling you far! Use this to your advantage!</p>\n<p><strong>Photon Grappler:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Left click on a black tile to fire a grappling laser! Use this to swing around!</p>\n<p><em>Do NOT press \"1\" or\"2\" while holding down left click using the Photon Grappler. This will permanently lock your player to the object you grappled to, essentially softlocking the game. I will publish a fix for this as soon as I can.<br/></em></p><p>(Update, par</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Various sound effects from OneShot, Undertale, and Hollow Knight were used;</p>\n<p>The intro song is a slightly modified version of Broken Machine, a OneShot fan-made song by Musiclide.<br/></p>\n<p>The environment itself was made using a very modified version of Prototiles on the Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>The paint mechanics were heavily inspired by Portal 2.<br/></p>\n<p>Links for the tool models will be put here soon, as I cannot find them right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Photon Grappler:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sci-fi-gun-807c786facf645a7a85d3074311beb9a</strong></p>\n<p>Chroma Coater:\u00a0https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/space-flamethrower-082805dcd1f84b45b6341573680b2...<br/></p>\n<p>End \"Portal\" Thing: modified version of\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/teleporter-25645</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T22:31:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a47/a473a4978a1000aea27bcbde96c48177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SkidFace"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
