Smith Games<br/></p>\n<p>Blocks from from Nibiru are falling into our dimension.  The blocks arrive in shapes of four and stack on top of other blocks.  Save the world from destruction by destroying the blocks before they reach the top of the dimensional plane.  Destroying blocks will periodically award bonuses for your ship.  Be careful to watch the heat meter above each ship, as overheating will require your cannons an extended period of time to cool off before you can shoot again.</p>\n<p>In other words, the game is a cross between the space shoot-em-up genre and falling block puzzle game genre.  The gameplay is inspired by games like Gyruss and Tetris.</p>\n<p>Bonuses</p>\n<ul><li>Red - Multi-shot cannon</li><li>Cyan - Heat Reduction</li><li>Magenta - Extra Ship</li><li>Green - Bomb</li><li>Yellow - Increased Speed</li></ul>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>Left / A key - Rotate ships clockwise</li><li>Right / D key - Rotate ships counter clockwise</li><li>Up / W key - Move ships in</li><li>Down / S key - Pull ships out</li><li>Space / Left Mouse Button - Fire cannons</li><li>Right Mouse Button - Use bomb</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2c/b2c34578d49a0a05add4c80cad7ebfbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Levi D.
