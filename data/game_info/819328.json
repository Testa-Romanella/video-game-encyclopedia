Meaning if you roll a 1, you can't move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then I thought that was a bit plain by itself, so I added a second dice that determines where you can hit on the opponents grid. This was pretty much ripped off of One Step From Eden where you have the indicator and all of your cards are relative to that, but you have to remember in the moment what tiles that card will hit. So in this, it will roll a number and you can only hit the tiles corresponding to that number relative to your indicator.</p><p>It was a pretty hectic weekend, not great time to be making a game. I had two birthdays, and a wedding, so I'm currently back at my parents working on a bean bag chair. So I didn't have as much time as I would've liked. But I managed to make a barebones game I think (emphasis on barebones).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T17:01:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/0778c64617adbbe428eb38256d78b32d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anogrm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
