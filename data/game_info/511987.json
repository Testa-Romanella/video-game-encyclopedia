Scratch Cat Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property, person, or intense psychological trauma.</p>\n<p>Join our Discord!</p>\n<p>Official teaser site here.</p><p>Catch up on the characters and lore on the Six Hours wiki!</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ EVERYTHING BEFORE PLAYING!</strong></p>\n<p>This game is a parody of Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's. Though there is no grotesque imagery or backstory, there are still jumpscares if you happen to lose. If you are sensitive to flashing images and loud sounds, please refrain from playing this game.</p>\n<p><strong>=HOW TO SAVE/LOAD YOUR PROGRESS=</strong></p>\n<p>1) Press Save on the menu to show your save code.</p>\n<p>2) Copy the save code or write it down somewhere. You can now safely exit the game.</p>\n<p>3) To load your save, press the Load button and enter your save code. (WARNING: Entering anything other than a save code may reset your progress!)</p>\n<p>4) Restart the game. Your save should be just how you left it.</p>\n<p><strong>=STARS=</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of making progress by beating nights like in FNaF, in this game all of the nights are the same (with the exception of Nightmare Mode and the Custom Night), and you make progress by earning stars.</p>\n<p>There are four stars you can get in this game:</p>\n<p>1) Complete your first night shift and get paid.</p>\n<p>2) Discover a secret based on a clue you were given at the end of your first shift.</p>\n<p>3) Complete Nightmare Mode.</p>\n<p>4) Complete 20/20/20/20 mode with no cheats active.</p>\n<p>Hold R for about 3 seconds to perform a hard reset. This will revert the game back to its original state before you started playing. (For mobile users, just reload the page.)</p>\n<p>Please do not spoil the game to others. It's more fun to discover everything for yourself. Spoiler comments and comments of save codes will be deleted.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03fc74fd21da1353cd628380fbb495d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GT Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
