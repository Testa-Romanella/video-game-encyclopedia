{"id": 366775, "slug": "town-of-thieves", "name": "Town Of Thieves", "name_original": "Town Of Thieves", "description": "<p><strong><em>This game is at prototype stage - everything you see here is early pre-alpha footage.</em></strong></p>\r\nSo what is this game about?\r\n<p>Town Of Thieves is a turn based crime management game.\u00a0\u00a0Organise your gangs, scout area and properties for intel. Burgle, pickpocket, extort and threaten properties to earn cash, reputation and alter loyalties to take control of the town.</p>\r\nWhat next?\r\n<p>I'm constantly working on the game, but the game is currently a\u00a0solo development. That means progress is slow but steady.\u00a0 Current plans are:-</p>\n<ul><li>Complete a sandbox mode, with basic different starting/ending\u00a0 conditions.</li><li>Currently a limit on number of gangs and characters, need to re-organise the GUI to deal with this. Will probably be other GUI improvements as the game develops.</li><li>More focus on your individual gang members, more stats and behaviours. With improvement in feedback information, giving more depth and understanding.</li><li>Graphic improvements, this current prototype is using low res building graphics. I have higher\u00a0resolution versions i need to switch to. Road tiles are my own (awful) efforts, and need replacement. Would also like to add animations, of town inhabitants and gang placements (rather than current marker).</li><li>SFX, would like to give it the noise of a city, to give a better experience.</li><li>More buildings and actions, giving more complexity to the game.</li><li>Hopefully will receive feedback from the community, to improve balancing, ideas and comments.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Further\u00a0details of features can be found here:-\u00a0\u00a0https://itch.io/t/473286/features-to-be-implemented</p>\r\nFuture hopes.\r\n<p>Hopefully\u00a0the prototype will develop into a\u00a0fully functioning game. At which point the game will likely\u00a0 become\u00a0a paid product and will look to get the game on other platforms (steam, etc.).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T05:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aaa031bbb4e2d6ffb618092dd9837dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niris Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
