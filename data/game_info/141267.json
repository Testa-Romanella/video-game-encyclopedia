In any city where magic is studied, you are likely to run into youths firing off tiny versions of real-life hexes at eachother \u2013 miniature fireballs zing off pavements and poison auras drift over the dinner table (much to the chagrin of the parent who spent an age preparing a healthy supper for their sprogs).</p><p>As a new Microhex user, you will have a chance to challenge human opponents, or play against specially conjured replicas of high-ranking hexers who belong to guilds of note. Align yourself with a guild and receive a boon to their favoured school of magic. Climb the league rankings, ascend in your chosen guild and become the best hexer amongst your peers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a2fec5620db1ab2f110bff098910e75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zombie#4"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
