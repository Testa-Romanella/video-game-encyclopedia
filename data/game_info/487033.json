(haha get it? Super Cold...)</p>\n<p>Overview:<br/>Touhou: Super Cold Assault is a top-down shooter game but time stops only when you move. Think of it as like Enter the Gungeon and Super Hot Combined. This game was mad for the Touhou Gam Jam from August 20 til August 23 of 2020 within 74 hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Downloads:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Windows, Mac\u00a0 and Linux Build are available. Do note that this is not the original jam build as I have tweaked a few things, and I have to change a soundtrack that is only allowed to use during the jam period. You can still play the original build here but the link will expire soon, I will edit this once it does.</p>\n<p>https://touhougamejam2020.web.app/en/work/UAlZA0WxebPs7FWQ/</p>\n\n<p>Story:<br/></p>\n<p>It is summer and the scarlet devil is going on a vacation, but a bunch of fairies just so happens to freeze the entire beach for no good reason. With the vacation plan ruined Sakuya decided to take on the matters with her time stopping ability. Not without some weird gimmick from Remilia to amuse her. She has one job, send a message to the fairies that it is SUPER COLD.</p>\n\n<p>Controls :</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>mouse to aim</li><li>left click to shoot</li><li>Backspace for emergency restart</li></ul>\n<ul><li>mechanics/ rules:</li><li>time moves only when you stop</li><li>shooting increments time a little bit</li><li>you need to reload your knifes, they take time, best to stand still to reload faster</li><li>kill every enemy within the time limit to win</li></ul>\n<p>you can refer at the controls at anytime in the READ_ME.txt<br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Development/ Sprite art : Iced_Lemon\u00a0<br/>https://twitter.com/Iced_Lemon_Draw</li><li>Resources:<ul><li>Beach Tile-set : finalbossblues<br/> https://twitter.com/messages/157315604-808683615940788224</li></ul><ul><li>Sound Tracks:\u00a0<ul><li>\u00a0Surfing-&gt; Komiku<ul><li>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku/Poupis_incredible_adventures_/Komiku_-...</li></ul></li><li>\u00a0<strong>Airship</strong>\u00a0 -&gt; Visager</li><li><strong>Welcome Player!</strong>\u00a0 -&gt; Visager</li><li><strong>Miniboss Fight</strong>\u00a0-&gt; Visager<ul><li>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World_2</li><li>https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Visager/Songs_From_An_Unmade_World</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects<ul><li>Knife throw.mp3 -&gt; Gingie<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/Gingie/sounds/181679/</li></ul></li><li>Hit_01.wav -&gt; LittleRobotSoundFactory</li><li>Hit_03.wav -&gt; LittleRobotSoundFactory</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/LittleRobotSoundFactory/packs/16681/?page=2#sound</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Special Thanks:<ul><li>bear_the_dice</li><li>NICKSTICK23</li><li>DracoGideon</li><li>Touhou Game Dev Hub Discord</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>Patch notes from the original version:</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed bullet oversize issue</li><li>\u00a0Fixed an issue where some soundtracks are not looping</li><li>\u00a0Fixed a bug where time slows down in level transition</li><li>Fixed the random death issue</li><li>Fixed some typos</li><li>Stages are now smaller</li><li>Overhauled a few stages</li><li>You now have a 60 second time limit instead of 100</li></ul>\n<p>Disclaimer:<br/>Touhou Project original concept, characters, and other elements are the property of ZUN and Team Shanghai Alice.
