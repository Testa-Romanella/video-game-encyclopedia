Simple, right? <br/>Arrow Keys or WASD to move the Boat around. <br/>Watch out though, this ain't no pleasure cruise! There's no time to pack them balls securely and the sea's a little jumpy!<br/> Make it back to the start before the timer runs out to go up a level! (yey!) With each level gained you have less time to make the trip. (boo) But don't worry, your boat will go faster! (woohoo)</p>\n<p>This project is built upon a Challenge from GameDev.TV Challenge Club.
