{"id": 95282, "slug": "soundsaber", "name": "Soundsaber", "name_original": "Soundsaber", "description": "<p>A twin-stick shooter where your music is your weapon. Whichever track you choose will power your engines and your lasers, but beware: your enemies are also driven by the music:<br/></p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSoundsaber fully supports all mainstream audio file formats: MP3, FLAC, M4A, AAC, WMA, WAV, OGG, AIFF, MOD, IT, S3M and XM are all fully compatible.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSoundsaber comes with a dozen sample tracks by artists like 0edit, Aaron Static, Blissbox and Jim Guthrie to get you started, but you can use any audio file on your hard drive to generate a Soundsaber level.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSoundsaber is compatible with 360 controllers but can equally be played with a mouse and keyboard. The controls are very simple: on a 360 controller, one stick aims while the other moves. On a keyboard, you can move using WASD or the arrow keys and use the mouse to aim (Spacebar pauses the game). No button presses are required: your weapons shoot automatically based on the music.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSoundsaber's difficulty dynamically adapts to your skill level. Getting hit will lower your Groove meter, which in turns lowers the difficulty but also lowers your potential score as well as your final rank.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks to this dynamic difficulty system, Soundsaber is supremely accessible and can be enjoyed by players of any skill level. Achieving perfect scores on a difficult song is a feat worthy of the most dedicated hardcore gamer, but the same song can be equally enjoyed by someone playing for the first time. You will never die and have to start over: nothing comes between you and enjoying your music.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou earn points by collecting Motes of Sound dropped by defeated enemies. Each song keeps its own local high score table. Identical songs will always generate the same gameplay, so you can play the same song over and over to try and improve your score or beat your friends.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tDifferent songs will generate different gameplay. Try a variety of tracks and see what comes out, you may find there are some surprises in store for you...\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tSoundsaber is currently available on both Windows PCs and OSX.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c9/3c9777dc772a2ad3ff626303aab5110d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SonorousGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
