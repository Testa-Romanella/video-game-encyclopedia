From XP, to VX, to VX Ace, to MV, I've used and mastered them all, making some almost passable games along the way. Nothing special, after all, since I <em>was </em>using RPG Maker. But this, though...</p>\n<p>This is the worst game I have ever created, hands-down. I was tired, half-delirious, and that's saying something considering my usual condition. Not to mention it took me all of 30 minutes to make.</p><p>\u00a0Never before have I wished death upon my own creations as much as I have this very day. But Bundo and his little friends should all die in a burning bonfire. Yes, I understand that's redundant, but it's best to be safe when trying to kill something so horrible it cannot even be described by human words.</p>\n<p>I give you: Pretentious RPG, or VIDEO GAME, for short. I promise you, there is no greater pain than having to play this all the way through.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd8/fd8ea282968460eac5de5867bbb766ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["YellowCircleDev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
