When it looks like you're overcoming it, it appears behind you to remind you of your fears. If you are in this situation, the things you like to do lose importance, lose color and often something you liked to do only makes you fall further into the well.</p>\n<p>In the game, there are three levels of state: Light, where you want to be and where you know you are coming from,\u00a0 although the day-to-day activities that entertain you have lost color and remind you of your fears;\u00a0 Darkness,\u00a0 it's behind everything,\u00a0 it's internal thoughts,\u00a0 the subconscious. It is misrepresenting and bringing to the worst option an event or a sensation;\u00a0 Finally,\u00a0 there is the Well,\u00a0 the total depression, where the shadows of your fears,\u00a0 take on color,\u00a0 gain strength and prevent you with much more resistance to get out of it.</p>\n<p>Mental illness is an issue that is spoken about little and many people do not give importance to them, \"Darkness\" and \"You are your own enemy\",\u00a0 were the themes of this Jam and have made me think about this issue.The game tries to get to have the white bar full,\u00a0 fleeing the wave of depression and avoiding the impulses that make you fall into the well.</p>\n<p>Being a 72-hour Jam, I wanted to make a small game and try to explain this disease without words. I hope I have been able to convey the message.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing, helping your family and friends and if you never know someone in this situation, look for professional help and treat it very delicacy, because it deserves it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T16:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b00a3b5d07350a61cea43a34850ce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Endorth"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
