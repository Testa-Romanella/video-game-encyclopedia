When his father passes away, Noah must deal with coming into manhood on his own. His best friend, Misty, just wants to be there for him, and has feelings that she's been hiding. When a new foreign exchange student takes an interest in Noah, the plot thickens. Stuck between adventure and comfort, Noah must choose what to do, and who to be with.</p>\n\n<p>Features a hidden relationship system that alters the story based on the player's decisions. There are multiple story routes to explore. Great Lo-fi music throughout the game to set the various moods.</p>\n\n<p>This VN does deal with some heavier topics, but is overall rather light and should not be too much of a trigger for most people. I hope you enjoy!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Made with RenPy. Not yet complete, just sharing what I have for now. All credits listed within the game's main menu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T10:26:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7b/c7b30cbdb29a95f33f3a978c1082f59a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["djwc95"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
