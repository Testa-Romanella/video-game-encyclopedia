Destructible Walls -\u00a0walls don't last forever, they can take hits and be destroyed</p>\n<p>2. Vacuums - like black holes, appear briefly want to take in your ball</p>\n<p>3. Portals - will suck your ball out and move them to another location</p>\n<p>4. Random generation - levels are randomly-generated</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Bugs</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Gravity effect from vacuums is wonky (needs adjustment)</p>\n<p>2. Portals can accidentally trap your ball in a solid brick</p>\n<p>3. Wall bricks may take too long to break, making it too easy\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys - move paddle</p>\n<p>Space - launch ball</p>\n<p>Escape - pause menu</p>\n<p>Mouse (Left Click)- menu navigation</p>\n<p>[Debug] Minus - clear scoreboard (on Scoreboard Menu Only)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bricks</strong></p>\r\nStandard BricksTake one hit to destroyStrong BrickTakes two hits to destroySolid BrickCannot be destroyed, acts like a wallSpecial BrickTakes four hits to destroy, \"mimics\" other bricksInvisible BrickInitially \"invisible\" and must be hit before it<br/>appears and can be destroyed\u00a0<br/>(Hard &amp;\u00a0All-Star modes only)Wall BrickPrevent the ball from going out of bounds but<br/>after 20 hits, they fall apart\r\n\n<p><strong>Power-Ups</strong></p>\n<p>Every 10th brick always drops a powerup.
