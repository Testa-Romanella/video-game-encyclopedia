{"id": 771226, "slug": "harry-potter-and-the-walking-dead-game", "name": "Harry Potter and The Walking Dead Game", "name_original": "Harry Potter and The Walking Dead Game", "description": "<p>Directly inspired by the RPG Game I made for Jam 1, I've taken the plotline and brought it to life\u00a0with a Top-Down 2D Game made in Unity.\u00a0\u00a0Combining two of my favorite\u00a0franchises with completely different characters and storylines, helped create a completely new universe that was exciting to explore.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>In my game, Hogwarts has been infiltrated by a herd of Walkers, sent by the Muggles as a means to irradicate the Magical World. The Walkers have no mercy,\u00a0attacking everything and everyone in their sight. The amount of magical blood that has been spilled is countless. The famous Harry Potter, in the middle of all the Chaos, loses two of his best friends, leaving the last hope to save Hogwarts from complete Annihilation. A Walker has infected one of the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, and in doing so, has obtained her Magical abilities. With no control over her power, she creates Magical Clones of her Walker Self and has taken over a certain part of Hogwarts. Harry must find this Walker, and kill her before she\u00a0is able to gain control of all her powers. With so many clones, there is no way to know which clone is the original master. Harry must kill every clone until he finds the one, behind all the destruction. Will he be able to protect the legacy of Hogwarts, or will his known name, be wiped out alongside the rest of the Wizard World.</p>\n<p>The player will be playing as Harry. The aim is to kill the Walkers until you kill the main one. However, there is a certain time in which the main one has to be killed. Each time you choose to replay the game again, the time will randomly change between 50secs to 180seconds. On the screen is a countdown informing the player how much time they have left. If the player is able to kill the main Walker before the time runs out, they win, and if not they lose. Along with the main goal of the game, the player can collect these red gems, which I refer to as 'Philosopher Stones\". If the game were to be fully developed eventually these gems and be stored and used to purchase upgrades, new characters, and new spells.</p>\n<p>Strict time conditions give the game more adrenaline rush and put stress upon the player. If the game were to be properly developed, I would include new levels, new locations, as well each time a player chooses to play the game again change the location of the main Walker, because as of right now I've only placed her in one spot for the player to find her, and every time the game is replayed she stays in that spot, so that defeats the purpose of the game, as her location is known then.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Here is the Game Play Demo:</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy the prototype level of my game and get immersed in the frustration, stress, thrill, and terror of the\u00a0apocalyptic world of Harry Potter!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Links to Assets, Artwork, Animations, and Soundtracks used to make the game:</p>\n<p>Background and Tile Maps:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/rogue-fantasy-castle-16472...</p>\n<p>Harry Potter Artwork and Animations:\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/artwork/d8PBJJ</p>\n<p>Zombie Idle Animation:\u00a0https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/94505292162248387/</p>\n<p>Zombie Death Smoke Effect Animation:\u00a0https://monophy.com/gifs/asparstudio-motion-smoke-asap-aspar-RMYbjGPbVt2xI2325X</p>\n<p>Impact Explosion Effect Animation:\u00a0https://codemanu.itch.io/impacthit-fx-animations</p>\n<p>Rotating Red Gem Animation:\u00a0https://giphy.com/stickers/art-girl-SiGjBqizFrcXWk5iBb</p>\n<p>Gem Collection Effect Animation:\u00a0https://github.com/hoovercj/vscode-power-mode/issues/1</p>\n<p>Main Menu Background Music: https://github.com/hoovercj/vscode-power-mode/issues/1</p>\n<p>Game Background Music:\u00a0 http://bit.ly/2GsvISx2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T18:07:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f482b10f5e1dd01df58f91fe2c309376.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["raahim03"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
