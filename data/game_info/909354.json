Godot 4 is still in beta and there are still quite a few issues with the HTML5 export.</p>\n<ul><li>The web version only works on Chrome (and likely some\u00a0other Chromium) browsers, due to how itch currently handles SharedArrayBuffer.</li><li>On some systems (observed on a few Macs), the web version takes incredibly long to load, or doesn't load at all. This seems to be due to shader compilation issues, and I've been attempting to find a fix.\u00a0<br/><strong>One possible workaround for Macs:<br/></strong>I was able to get the game to go from taking minutes to load to\u00a0loading in &lt;5 seconds\u00a0on my 1st gen M1 Macbook Pro by doing the following:<ul><li>Navigate to `chrome://flags`</li><li>Enable `Experimental WebAssembly`</li><li>Set `Choose ANGLE graphics backend` to `Metal`</li><li>Restart Chrome</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T18:02:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6637193606286c5cd3b13cfdce0726.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["lopar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
