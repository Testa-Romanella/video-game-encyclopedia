{"id": 233965, "slug": "runnget", "name": "Run'N'Get", "name_original": "Run'N'Get", "description": "'Run'N'Get' is an infinite runner. In the beginning you can choose one of the three characters, if you want you can change your choice every time before each run. When you hit the Play button, your character starts to run along the road in the city. Your main goal is to run as long as you can collecting flowers and presents. During your run, try to avoid all the obstacles by using the game controls: arrows or WASD and 'Space'. You can avoid them by moving the character up or down the lane or by jumping over some of them (not all) using 'Space' or sliding using the right arrow. If you hit any of the obstacles, your character will lose a life. But don't worry: you can restore up to 5 lives if you gather a Heart bonus (one life for each Heart). There also other power-ups in the game which allow you become invincible, speed up or attract flowers and presents.<strong>MAIN GAME FEATURES</strong>:<br/>+ Choose one of three characters: <br/><br/>+ Avoid different obstacles by jumping , sliding <br/>or running in different directions <br/><br/>+ Collect:  and <br/><br/>+ Use different power-ups:<br/> get an extra life;<br/><br/> become invincible;<br/><br/> collect nearest flowers;<br/><br/> speed up.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/526/526f0487e30fba691236a100616dea54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TonAme"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TonAme"], "esrb_rating": null}
