However, during their journey they end up crashing into an unstable version of the ExtraNet and must now use their unique abilities to escape.</p>\n<p>You can control P1 with the AD and W Keys and P2 with left and right mouse buttons. P2 can\u2019t jump independently, but can act as a bouncy platform for P1, can squeeze into tight spaces and can hover through the air a little. P1 on the other hand is bigger, can jump and can cause mini-earthquakes when he falls from larger heights, causing secret passages to appear. P1 and P2 can assist each other in lots of different ways, often with the aid of special pads they stand on allowing them to do anything from teleporting to moving blocks in the game world.</p>\n<p>Visit our website to learn more and download our Press Kit<br/></p>\n<p>Article by alphabetagamer.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T04:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a004fa6cf7b5f1abfe969b4ae8579cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["2players"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
