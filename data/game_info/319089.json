You wake up in your small home to find your fridge wide open with all your eggs missing and a broken egg trail leading outside. Furious you won\u2019t get your morning breakfast, you grab your bomb bag and head to the supermarket. You live far outside of town so it won\u2019t be a quick stop to the shop. Along this journey you will explore various environments where you\u2019ll solve puzzles, fight enemies, obtain items, and find secrets. And you may just find out where your precious protein went. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7ef78cd17d4a3faf524aaa9df4019a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dustin Downs"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
