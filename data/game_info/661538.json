Some are jerks. Even worse, some are jerks AND are transphobic. <em><strong>Gross!</strong></em><br/></p>\n\n<p>As Hazel, how do you deal with your already-strenuous coffee-making job? Do you practice your best customer service voice and put up with the abuse of caffeine-addicted customers while pretending that that lady didn\u2019t just aggressively misgender you? Or do you stand up for yourself against these people, risking your job and your paycheck? It is up to you to balance your stamina with your tip earnings and your job performance.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><em>Craft Drinks\r\n</em></p>\n<p>Learn how to operate different coffee machines in ultra-simple mini-games. Each machine produces its own ingredient. Add ingredients into your cup in different orders to create the perfect drink for your deserving customers!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Deal with Customers\r\n</em></p>\n<p>Naughty or nice: it\u2019s your choice! Very simple conversations with customers present you with either an opportunity or a challenge. Do you burn some stamina being nice to a mean person in order to earn a better tip? Or do you act rude to them to blow off some steam and gain stamina? It is always a balancing act between your mental health and your job performance: don\u2019t get fired and don\u2019t burn yourself out!\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Be Gay and Be Trans!</em></p>\n<p>Spend a month as Hazel and everyone in her life as you work to save up $1,000 by the end of the month. Plan and schedule your week using a bullet journal. Track your money earned, your future activities, and your past accomplishments all in one menu. Meet a diverse (and still expanding!) cast of queer characters who each have their own stories to tell and whom you can help out with their own arcs.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning: Transphobia and Misgendering\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>At its core, Boiling Over is an empowering and uplifting story about queer happiness and the agency of transgender people. However, it also strives to be an authentic game that depicts the real-world issues that transgender people face.\r\nYou have the option at the start of the game to censor any and all transphobic dialogue. If you choose this option, any and all harmful dialogue will be replaced with an abstract description of what is being said. <br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Connect With Us!</strong></p>\n<p>Twitter: @BunchPlush</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/PyWn2FM9Pj\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anonymous Feedback: https://forms.gle/WEoyVo3T9QUBDkBW9\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:35:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/6223ccadf683872ccb88af025619044b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Plush Bunch"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
