Done for the Video Game Design (VGD) class project in PWr. Finish the quests and fight the enemies in order to reach the exit. Playable at https://hachiretsu.itch.io/sketchdash\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>The game is still buggy, so when you are stuck on the walls or cannot enter the portals due to them being generated close to the walls, for example, click on the `pause` button to reset the game. Your state will be saved, but the whole layout will be regenerated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound effects from freesound.org: https://freesound.org/people/niamhd00145229/sounds/422709/ https://freesound.org/people/DDmyzik/sounds/460664/</p>\n<p>Music by Aaron Krogh:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/aaron-anderson-11/310-world-map-loop\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://soundcloud.com/aaron-anderson-11/sets/rpg-maker-music-loops</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/pirates-theme\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arts and animations were drawn by me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:06:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48b1894d95f840f9be743b8b8a287e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hachiretsu"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
