Y'know, the usual).</p>\n<p>On your turn, press Spacebar to roll a dice to give you a set number of moves. Use those moves to make your way towards the door, avoiding the security systems, which will then toggle inbetween turns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make it all the way to the end to win the <em>grand prize</em>! OoooOOOooOOoh!</p>\n<p>Gotta be honest with you, I pulled this together in like six hours, so it's pretty great (for the circumstances). I think it's a pretty neat prototype, and something I'd like to maybe take further one day, when\u00a0I have time.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:38:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8d/b8dbe890b59d63ef4ea6d18b465fa644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Let's Talk Game Design"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
