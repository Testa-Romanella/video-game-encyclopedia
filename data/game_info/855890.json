When the player consumes enough chili peppers, the player enters the \"Turn Up the Heat\" mode, where he can move faster and customers don't mind waiting a bit longer to get their order. Also, many of our appliances in the kitchen utilize turning up the heat to cook their ingredients together!</p>\n<p>FOCUS - We used the focus \"Multi-Use\" in many ways throughout our game. Many of our appliances can cook multiple recipes which forces the player to be strategic about where they put what item. Also, the chilis are multiuse, as they can be used to eat or to cook with.</p><p>CREDIT - All art was created by Peter, but the audio and sound effects were pulled from the YouTube audio library, with no credit attribution required.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:13:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59aec972c514581aa9da5ebe465b0fef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DonQuixote"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
