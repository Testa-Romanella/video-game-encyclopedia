Can you command your army of ants to prolong the life of the <strong>COLOSSAL CREATURE</strong> that is the Turtle Island in this <strong>UNSTABLE</strong> and <strong>UNSUSTAINABLE</strong> ecosystem? Can you protect the magical Turtle Island Flowers long enough for them to produce the typical <strong>OVERGROWTH</strong> the Turtle Islands were once famous for?<br/><br/>Using a relatively <strong>UNSTABLE</strong> combination of technologies, this game was made as a learning experience to get our feet wet in Godot+Rust+WASM+ASR (automatic speech recognition) via the <strong>Deepgram API</strong>, hopefully there aren't <em>too</em> many bugs (pun absolutely intended). Enjoy the masterful art, making use of a soothing <strong>PASTEL</strong> palette that may make you momentarily forget the seriousness of the environmental situation.</p>\n<p>All dramatic prose aside, this was a really fun project to work on, and we are just glad we were able to get this modest demo out! We learned a lot :)<br/></p>\n<p>Credits: Programming: Nikola Whallon, Mark Lodato; Art: Sam DeVarti; Music/Sfx: Nikola Whallon</p>\n<p>GitHub: https://github.com/deepgram-devs/GarbageGame<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T08:26:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6d/d6dadcd12bf7fdb473d9845848b0f3b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brown Can Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
