Kitty is interested in the Moon and what's beyond. Are you interested?</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>If you'd like to play this game online before downloading it (the standalone versions have not very pretty margins, like videos taken with a phone kind of thingie, beware) or you'd like to try some of my other games, you can do so on my Newgrounds page, here:</p>\n<p>https://liquiddarkness.newgrounds.com/</p>\n<p>***<br/></p>\n<p>This is the second game in <strong>Fluff &amp; Puff</strong> series I'm developing. <strong>Cute, family-friendly</strong> games are not my speciality as I'm mostly keen on adult games and themes. I work on my projects whenever I can which, unfortunately, is not enough in my opinion. I'd like to create more and better and faster but in order to be able to do so I need to change the source of income. That's where my Patreon page steps in (<strong>www.patreon.com/liquiddarkness</strong>). I like to be the creator I would gladly support which in practice means that I post more than updates on my games (they would be scarce and full of frustration, who likes frustration?). I recommend other people's games if I find them recommendable and I like to think I know my kinks, hentai and stuff. You have to be <strong>18+</strong> to enter the page, legally speaking.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>I am very fresh to game developing world, despite <strong>KKPP</strong> being my third \"finished\" game. I put finished in quotes because I do intend to come back to it and improve it one day. Add some features, make it mobile-friendly and so on. That being said, please forgive me any mistakes I might have made. I work really hard to understand how to code and make things do things in Unity but that ain't easy.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>There's an <strong>endless mode button</strong> hidden badly, try to find it, teeheehee.</p>\n<p>You might have <strong>different score</strong> every time you play.</p>\n<p>There's one \"enemy\" that will <strong>take some of your points away</strong> if destroyed.</p>\n<p>ENJOY~!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:46:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b0407296ea875b03a4ff89ee6f9d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jumack"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
