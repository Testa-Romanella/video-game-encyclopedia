Set in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth, the player takes control of a nameless protagonist living in a cyberpunk city who is planning their own birthday party and must traverse the ruined environment to search for supplies. Along the way, they will encounter a cast of strange characters, each with their own interpersonal drama and relationships the player will have a direct hand in resolving. With a vaporwave aesthetic and pixel art inspired by 16-bit games on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System,<em> Partypocalypse</em> is a game that explores the impact one person's actions have on the lives of others. The focus isn't on survival so much as building emotional connections with the characters you meet in the wasteland. By learning their stories, you'll be able to help them with their problems, guiding them towards their happy ending. You might even see them again later. You might not be able to stop the apocalypse, but you\u00a0<em>can\u00a0</em>throw\u00a0the\u00a0raddest\u00a0party\u00a0ever.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/347/3473d18bf6561ad118d640ad1a4714cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eolswold"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
