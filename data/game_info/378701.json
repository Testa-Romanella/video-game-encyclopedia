{"id": 378701, "slug": "chord-dice", "name": "Chord dice", "name_original": "Chord dice", "description": "Many modern songs are based on a maximum of six chords, which corresponds to the number of eyes in a dice. So we had the idea to create a cube with chords instead of numbers and play the diced combination. So playful interesting combinations can arise.<br/><br/>Before you can start playing, you need to record your own chords. Of course you can also record different sounds instead of chords.<br/><br/>Press 'roll' or shake your iPhone to get a new dice combination. By tapping on a single chord, you can hear the recording of the chord. Touching the small cube next to the chord changes the chord of the single cube.<br/><br/>To hear the combination, press the green play button. With the other two green buttons, you can pause or stop playing. If you like the combination you can export it to e.g. your e-mail account.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:00:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/366/3665113187f5fe3c6b3d103402cfa821.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Daniel Furrer"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Daniel Furrer"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
