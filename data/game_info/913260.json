I spent a little over 2 years creating this game. Personally, I'm a fan of games that are initially really difficult but then become <strong>almost </strong>easy once you really get the hang of it.<br/><br/>It is in this vain I designed Punch A Bunch. If you decide to purchase a copy, I salute and thank you, I hope that you'll enjoy this little game I created. And should you find yourself frustrated, remember, never don't give up.<br/><br/>Note: At least one gamepad is required in order to play local multiplayer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T04:19:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db5ada5276f8f8a4900f4957b09f3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pontypants"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pontypants"], "esrb_rating": null}
