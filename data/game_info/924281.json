The goal is to grow in \"tastiness\" based on three criteria and win the race based on a combination of race order and the degree of tastiness criteria achieved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To win the race, it is not enough to simply be the fastest to reach the finish line. You also need to adjust all elements of the race to optimize the three aspects of \"tastiness\" related to bread. Even if your rank is low, you can still aim for first place in overall performance if you can adjust the tastiness effectively. This is the big attraction and appeal of the game.</p>\n<p>Don't miss the original story that also reveals the mystery behind the unnatural game title.</p>\n<p>Video submissions are welcome and no permission or contact is required.
