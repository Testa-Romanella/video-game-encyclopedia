{"id": 224764, "slug": "chess-repertoire-trainer", "name": "Chess Repertoire Trainer", "name_original": "Chess Repertoire Trainer", "description": "This app is designed to help you execute the moves you have selected for your openings. It uses an advanced memorizing technique called \"spaced repetition\" which focus on your weaknesses.<br/>The app is able to identify the positions for which you are having problems and helps you to correct these weaknesses by using an effective pattern of repetitions.<br/><br/>The concept is very simple and easy to use: you have to select and enter only one move for you own color (your move) and then enter all possible moves of your opponent in response to your move. <br/>Please note this app is not a PGN viewer, it's a training tool. Many apps already exist to explore chess openings variants, but it's not the purpose of this app. <br/>This app will rather help you to execute your opening plan.
