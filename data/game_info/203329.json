Mehro can defeat any enemy he comes across, but the untalented Loogie is so much of a failure, that he dies instantly when he makes contact with an enemy that is slightly stronger than a Goombl. So, Loogie has went on a quest to defeat every Goombl in the world. Also there's a princess in need of help or something.</p><p>TIP: The giant goombls' weakness is his feet.</p><p>NOTE: This is a spoof on Luigi from the Mario franchise. I do not own Mario or Luigi. Please don't sue me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loogieman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
