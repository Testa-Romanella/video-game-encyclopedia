In this old world ravaged by war and scarred by the Malichor plague and the political scheming of the different factions, you need to regain your freedom and control of your own destiny. Using diplomacy, cunning or combat, as well as help from allies you make, it's up to you to end one man's ambitions of conquest, which could spell the end for the continent and your island.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExperience the unique world of GreedFall again by exploring the old continent! Travel across new landscapes, from Olima \u2013 the city of stars of the Bridge Alliance \u2013 to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands. Meet all the factions that share control over these nations and navigate the treacherous waters of their schemes and conspiracies. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate your own character and find allies to join your team.
