The theme: joined together. My friend Nick, https://itch.io/profile/watcher-of-anime, created the sprites for the game, while I did the programming and sound. The game is short, only one map-width long, and lacks polish, but it conveys the concept well enough. Let me know what you think. I learned a lot about working with PICO-8 during the jam, and I plan to make many more games with it\u00a0in the future. :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/532/532d6c43d680c241fee6e9aba3d659d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["galactical"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
