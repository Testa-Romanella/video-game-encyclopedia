Your goal is to use the provided pieces in the scrollable storage box to build a rectangle in the space to the right. Once the puzzle is solved, you move to next level (which has no effect except for bragging rights). You have five minutes to solve each puzzle.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>LMB:</strong> pick up and drop pieces. You can drop a piece you've picked up into the field or into the storage box.</li><li><strong>RMB:</strong> rotate piece.</li><li><strong>Mousewheel:</strong> scroll the piece list.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>INGAME BUTTONS</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>QUIT button:</strong> return to titlescreen.</li><li><strong>CLUE button:</strong> Click to activate clue mode, click again to return to normal mode.
