It is the third installment in the Tomb Raider series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>During a raid on ancient tombs, Lara finds a strange artifact and meets a scientist named Mark Willard. This artifact is a part of a Polynesian cult. Willard finds a sanctuary, but four other artifacts are lost. Lara sets out to find them.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The players travel through five locations. The game is somewhat not linear as after completing the first location (India), the players are free to choose one out of three environments and finish with Antarctica. Each location resembles a semi-open world with several puzzles, enemies, and platforming elements scattered across it.</p>\n<p>The puzzles in the game require moving items, jumping over obstacles, crawling or diving underwater. </p>\n<p>The game features a wide variety of weapons, including the iconic dual pistols which have unlimited ammo and serve as Lara&#39;s default weapons. At some time into the game, Lara loses all her weapons and has to find her way through the enemies before finding her pistols again. </p>\n<p>Huge improvements were made to the game&#39;s graphics and physics in order to improve the puzzles. For example, the doors now can be triangular. The improved physics allows for modifying the environment adding quicksands, swamps or cold water (Lara can&#39;t stay in it for too long, or she will get frozen to death).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T15:46:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90f/90f5d80bdce9df33d0be76f94c538faa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 47, "owned": 396, "beaten": 130, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 73, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 140, "suggestions_count": 518, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 140, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Core Design"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Eidos Interactive", "Enix"], "esrb_rating": null}
