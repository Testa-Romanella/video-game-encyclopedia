{"id": 970658, "slug": "adventures-of-tara", "name": "Adventures of Tara", "name_original": "Adventures of Tara", "description": "You play as Tara, an elven schoolgirl attending her final year at a university learning different types of magic and interacting with the other students and teachers. She is quite skilled in magic but her personality is, well, a little abrasive...alright, alright, she is a total bitch! However, she will have some experiences in the near future where she will be forced to endure humiliation and sexual encounters. If you don't want to game as a girl being forced to do naughty things...walk away now!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a campus full of goblins, demons, horny students, manipulative teachers, statues(?), lesbians, interesting new spells, and a few other surprises...anything that CAN happen to Tara, probably will (tentacle, futanari and pregnancy content can be blocked in game). 111 different re-watchable scenes and 10 possible endings make your choices matter in what Tara will experience. Do you try and have Tara resist as much as possible? Or do you search out for every possible perverted encounter and see just how corrupt she can become? The choice is yours!<br/><br/>There are some animations in the game but most of the scenes have 2 frame loops showing the action. There is quite a bit of re-playability as it would take multiple play-throughs to unlock all the possible content, but it is possible in the game to skip through previously unlocked scenes and speed through dialogue to search for scenes you have missed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T17:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64df251f8aa7a0f07423a746165468b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reepyr O'Lust"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reepyr O'Lust"], "esrb_rating": null}
