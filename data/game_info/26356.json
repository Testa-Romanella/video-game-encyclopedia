There are no limits to your flight \n      with 360\u00b0 movement and unique steering with the Nintendo DSi stylus. \n      AiRace offers you a chance to control one of nine planes and compete \n      against AI or human opponents in six exotic locations. With great \n      physics, plane upgrades, on-the-track power-ups and unique maps AiRace \n      offers a little bit more than your average racing.
