Buy a hotdog, hear a busker song or throw it into a sewer? Choose well, you have only one chance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What would others choose? Check out stats at the end of the game.

I found it highly interesting to compare my set of choices with what other players did. Much more interesting than score-based leaderboards!</p>\n<p><strong>Date</strong>: 12/2013\u00a0<br/><strong>Tools</strong>: OpenFL / HaXe, GIMP, Audacity, pug</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8ce3e712146b349bfdd5a21ae37f79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarnik"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
