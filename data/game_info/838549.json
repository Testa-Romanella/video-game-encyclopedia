(Virtual Integrated Collaborative Intelligence). Due to a virus from an alien spacecraft, your ability to solve a series of cyphers is compromised, so your operator must solve them  manually. With you guiding him to the correct solution, the two of you may still be able to commandeer the alien vehicle and escape.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to help the operator solve cyphers presented to you. You do this by looking at the current cypher and changing the priorities of symbols to guess, and by indicating which of the symbols the operator guessed are correct.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use the mouse to navigate the entire game:</p>\n<ul><li>Click on the arrow buttons to increase or decrease the priority of any given symbol</li><li>Click on the symbols in the current guess to mark them as correct</li><li>Click the button in the bottom-right corner to continue to the next guess</li></ul>\n<p>There is a volume control in the options menu (cog icon in the top right of the screen).</p>\n\n<p>There are three modes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Tutorial: </strong>A short demonstration showing you how to play. (You can also press the question mark button in the top-right corner during any mode to get some information about the interface.)</li><li><strong>Story: </strong>The intended initial experience. Contains story elements, and can be won, after which you are taken to a win screen.</li><li><strong>Survival: </strong>A mode that challenges you to solve as many cyphers as possible before you run out of energy. It scales up to a possible 12 symbols in a cypher with 8 different types of symbols. (Is it possible to get to that point? Maybe.)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Carel van Hemert (https://itch.io/profile/skyystorm)<br/>Coding, music, some design<br/></p>\n<p>Jaco van Hemert (https://jaco-van-hemert.itch.io/)<br/>Design, art, SFX, writing, some coding<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T21:59:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e41/e4142456226e116167950054d97522fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jaco van Hemert", "SkyyStorm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
