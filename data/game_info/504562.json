Nothing too complicated. The result? <strong><em>Grab Your Nutz!</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>As a squirrel forever falling from the world's tallest Infinite Tree (which totally exists somewhere, we're pretty sure), grab as many acorns as you can before the local bird population grabs you. Cardinals, Blue Jays and Red Tail Hawks all have different attack patterns and bird calls as they attempt to turn the squirrel into suet.</p>\n<p>It couldn't be simpler: Using the arrow keys, WASD or your controller, move around the screen in a perpetual free-fall. Dodge squirrel-smacking branches, snack on tasty acorns, and avoid getting picked off by one of many birds who - for whatever reason - see you as prey. We don't know exactly why a cardinal of all birds is attacking you, because we don't speak bird and couldn't ask, but we think it just hates squirrels.</p>\n<p>If you do get bird-napped you will be sent back to the top of the tree to repeat your fall and redeem your fail. There is no end for this poor squirrel - he's in his own Groundhog's Day nightmare.</p>\n<p>Would that make it a *Squirrel's Day* nightmare...?\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any case, help the poor squirrel grab his nuts - he needs all the help he can get.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4b7c9a59005e1149dc8fd4bacf5cdc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAGH Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
