You can scan the grid to see how much of the element is located under each tile.  <br/></p><p>The game is customizable.  The grid size, the amount of Element X, the amount of scans and extractions are all customizable before beginning a round.</p>This was a school project. I think the point was to use 2D arrays to make a grid? I'm not really sure about what the point was of this game (assignment-wise). I think it turned out ok, not super fun, but whatever...Enjoy!\n<p>Game by Carlo Albino</p><p>GitHub repo: https://github.com/CarloAlbino/ResourceScanner</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49fab03fc83a65fc20631f6c3b3fe269.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Carlo Albino"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
