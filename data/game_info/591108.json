However, when I tried other tower defence games on the market I found that they were way too simple, or just plain boring. Some of what I found were not even tower defense offline games. Selection of towers was too small, they was either easy to build or did not hold enough without donations. Enemies managed to tower rush you in case you play td games free. No matter which tower you got, your tower defence would crush and burn and your castle would fall. <br/> <br/>  So I thought: there should be td games free to play with different options for towers and defences and all the perks of great strategy games. I made this tower defense offline game in hopes that it will give you the depth of old school td game experience on modern devices. Strategy is important here because the resources available to achieve these goals are limited. Strategy here involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). It is a common knowledge that strategy typically involves two major processes: formulation and implementation. Formulation involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as strategic planning and strategic thinking. Implementation refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy. In this game to succeed you will need to understand both of these processes.<br/><br/>Hope you like it.
