As I was developing the alogrithms that would grow the procedural plants in that game, I fell in love with the austere beauty of the sharp, un-textured meshes that my early experiments created. Sculpture Park is about that beauty.</p><p>Rather than hiding them behind textures, and bump maps, and shaders, and everything else we do to transform polygons into simulacra of our reality, Sculpture Park puts polygons front and center. It's a showcase for these digital triangles that compose the virtual worlds we love.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T04:11:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/557/557114e4b1a1849e8aa135a7b274671d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Owen Bell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
