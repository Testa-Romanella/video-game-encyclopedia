But it's even harder than it sounds!<br/>The barrel sound is a free sample from Freesound.com<br/>Everything else was drawn/programmed by me using Godot\u00a0engine during the 3 hours period!<br/>When thinking about unconventional transportation the first thing that came to mind was the barrels from Donkey Kong, so I HAD to make a game about it!</p>\n<p>Sadly I ran out of time while making the UI and I really didn't want to go past the 3 hours limit. So everything UI related is just placeholders, at least it works and you can see your points!<br/><br/>Hope someone have fun with this!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T15:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ae/6ae36b4889f1e2319cb3acf1c5ef39ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lilian Reese"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
