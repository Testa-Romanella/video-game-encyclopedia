The catch? Buddy can't control the laser beam that shoots out of his eye every 5 seconds. Explore a secret facility filled with dangers to discover the truth about everything.<br/><br/>Additional information: LASERBOY is the miraculous remaster of the iconic video game by Catfun Corp, originally created for the Funvision Entertainment System. Thought until recently to have been forever lost to time, LASERBOY has been painstakingly rebuilt and faithfully recreated from the ground up by an expert team of digital archaeologists at Universal Entities using fragments of art and code found in the wreckage of [REDACTED]. A story of lore, lasers, and [REDACTED]. Music by Germany's pop sensation: Lenni Revenge.<br/><br/><br/><strong>A short, experimental game that began life as a simple game jam idea</strong><br/>We\u2019re a small, fledgling, but enthusiastic team of three, and this is our first serious game. Our goal with Laserboy was to create something compact but fun to build and mainly fun to play. We also wanted to learn how to work efficiently together and teach ourselves fundamental lessons that will be so important for our future projects.<br/><br/>We\u2019d love you to play Laserboy and hope you find it entertaining and relaxing. Perhaps with a bit of a challenge for those who seek it or a dash of chaos when you need to let loose. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to play: be as cautious as possible or go all-out crazy with your new-found abilities \u2013 it\u2019s all good :)<br/><br/>Whether you enjoy Laserboy or not, we\u2019d like to invite you to our Discussions page, say hi, and even share your thoughts. All feedback, comments, and questions are much appreciated.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T03:13:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e2/1e26db664a5aa908efdec9c1df06de9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 47, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Universal Entities"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Universal Entities"], "esrb_rating": null}
