{"id": 290709, "slug": "office-chair-death-match", "name": "Office Chair Death Match", "name_original": "Office Chair Death Match", "description": "<p>Office Chair DeathMatch (OCDM) is a top-down, pixel art racing game. You impersonate a new employee in a large company, who is received with the weirdest policy: all the employees must participate by law in an office chair racing tournament, not exactly as a team building activity.<br/></p>\n<p>In this tournament, the employees compete to (literally) fight and\u00a0destroy each other\u2019s chairs, earning chair pieces to repair theirs every time a fight is won or permanently losing them if it gets destroyed. Things got even more real with this rule: the winner of each race has the right to swap his chair with any of the eligible losers, permanently.</p>\n<p>The OCDM is already part of the company's culture to the point where it's almost a salvage celebration in the most tribal way. Everything is made using office stuff: from the tracks to the power-ups through all the floors of the company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game status</strong></p>\n<p>OCDM is currently in development with all its mechanics already coded. As we start to create the art for it, we wanted to share bits of the gameplay through a demo. The final game is intended to include 6 floors: factory, call center, web department, art department, sales and management, each one of them adding a new power-up or mechanic, and each floor will develop at least 9 tracks and a cool story because racing for no reason is boring (although you can skip the dialogues if you want).</p>\n<p>Our current demo features single player experience, the\u00a0first 2 tracks, the actual dialogues with placeholder animations, basic in-game assets, 5 controller presets (including AZERTY), and the repair/rebuild chair mechanic. We're planning to release more demos to showcase other mechanics, like the main one: <strong>the fights</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>PLEASE</strong>!!
