{"id": 778327, "slug": "atrophy", "name": "Atrophy", "name_original": "Atrophy", "description": "<p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine having your soul compressed, shattered, then hidden within the depths of a dilapidated mansion. Now picture yourself having to trek the spacious rooms and never-ending corridors to piece yourself back together. That is exactly the premise in this First-Person 3D Horror game, \"Atrophy.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note: This game is under so much development to the point that it is literally a prototype. Hopefully I can find some time to work on this because it was really fun to create.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Inspirations:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>This game is currently inspired by two games. The almost immediate giveaway is \"Dark Deception.\" I love the idea of a 3D FPS Horror Pac-Man and I wanted to create a similar experience. My \"Soul Fragments\" are basically the Soul Shards from that game.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I was also heavily inspired by \"Disney's The Haunted Mansion\" video game for the PS2 (also GameCube and Xbox). The requirement of specific fragment amounts was heavily inspired by the Shriveled Souls mechanic present in that game. You could only progress to certain rooms if you had the required number of Souls. Which is eventually what I plan to implement.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things to do in this short demo:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Open doors with a lovely scripted raycast feature.</li><li>Collect soul fragments by smashing your capsule collider on it.</li><li>Observe the fact that there aren't footstep sounds when you hold shift but are when you don't.</li><li>Watch a long introductory cutscene that is un-skippable because I didn't feel like scripting it.</li><li>Frown upon the fact that there aren't any rooms unlocked besides the Upstairs Hallway.</li><li>Get jumpscared by a weird looking face after traversing down the long hall and laugh out loud if you are my Game Production I professor.</li><li>Laugh at my inside jokes and realize you wasted like 3-5 minutes playing an extremely early prototype of a game.\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T05:38:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4daa73bbd82fb858f29440fee856a37a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
