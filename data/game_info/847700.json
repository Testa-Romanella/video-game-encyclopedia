It features modified environmental assets from the NeoCity Kitbash pack while all other assets are bespoke. This includes systems. audio, music, meshwork, particle systems,\u00a0and UI graphics. An attempt at multiplayer was failed early.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy this classic arcade style game using the best Unreal Engine 5 features!</p>\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>Cesar Suarez // cesar@rotu.com // Audio\r\n</p><p>Juan Andres Matos // jmatos.music@gmail.com // Music\r\n</p><p>Michael Hoag // bfhalfhawk@yahoo.com // Tech/Art<br/></p>\n<p>Sebastian Serrano // duderseb@hotmail.com // Tech/Art<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T17:03:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/294/294eee86977d7624f5cc303780ded0ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lonely Cracker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
