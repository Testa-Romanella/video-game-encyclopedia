It is based on an actual set of antique blocks that I played with as a child on my grandmother's living room floor. <br/><br/>You can print your designs, save a snapshot to the photo album on the iPhone or iPod Touch, share them on Facebook, or email them around the world.<br/><br/>You can also load and save designs to the \"gallery\", allowing you to keep your favorite designs and modify them later.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T05:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1f/f1fb70c68218816e77b9f3345057d9fc_BiVoxgF.jpg", "website": "http://www.nerdworks.com/blocks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Nerdworks"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Dan Weston"], "esrb_rating": null}
