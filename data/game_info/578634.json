With my own style of game play choices and art style, this game is sure to remind you of the beloved game and bring you back to the old arcade room. In this project I wanted to become more familiar with using For Loops, working within a 2D space, and my attempt at making a currency and store system. A lot of the\u00a0 problems I ran into\u00a0in this game have been solved\u00a0using\u00a0a mixture of researching what other people have done and simply figuring out how to solve the problem myself. I am very proud to present you this very small project.
