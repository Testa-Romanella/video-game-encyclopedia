The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a\u00a0solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game was first sold under the\u00a0<em>Connect Four</em>\u00a0trademark\u00a0by Milton Bradley\u00a0in February 1974.</p>\n<p>(I hooked this up from Wikipedia)</p><p>I wanted to mark this project as \"HTML\" (so it can be played in the browser) but if that's on, then the screenshots cannot be shown. But if you want to try this before you download the game, download the HTML first. (because I'm too lazy to make the website version. So rate, share if you want me to)</p><p>I first made this app as HTML and published it on the\u00a0Opera addons store, published it about a few months ago (July 2022), but I always get bored, so I decided to publish it on itch.io as well. Why not?</p><p>But of course, I got help with HTML, JavaScript, etc. With making the game (some parts of the game)\u00a0from the internet. With demo codes, tutorials, etc. And those codes are open source.</p>\n<p>I made this app especially for Windows, if you run macOS, I provided a \"zip\" file for you to use, but you will be needing a browser to work, same goes for mobile. Please don't judge me that there is only an actual app for Windows, I don't use macOS so I can't make macOS apps. I am already configuring \"VirtualBox\" to emulate a macOS device for me so I can finally use macOS. But it's not easy to do that.</p><p>I will make mobile apps for this so you don't have to use the \"zip\" file. But I'm also too lazy for that because I have to do a LOT of things to make it on mobile (Android and iOS)</p><p>I've spent a lot of time making this. Not just the game but this itch.io page as well. I've spent about 2-3 hours. So please consider donating/paying me before downloading this game, rating this game 5 stars and commenting of what you think of the game. Thanks for at least visiting this page and/or trying this game. I have more other games as well on my profile page (click on the \"View all by Angelo\" on the top right corner)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:40:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34f484692a5b8c3af72699686b1898e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Angelo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
