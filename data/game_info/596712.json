It is a short zombie-survival stealth game made to study ludonarrative dissonance and how that affects the play experience. The game is designed for the \"stealth\" gameplay mode, but includes a \"gun\" gameplay mode. The intention is for the participant to play the stealth version first, then play the gun version, then compare and contrast the experiences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to participate in the study (and are 18 years of age or older), please fill in this form. Keep in mind we are located in the GMT+1 timezone, so if you're located far away, that will affect the available times for participation in the study.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game contains no explicit blood or gore, but does contain firearms and textual references to violence.</p>\n<p>It can be played directly in the browser (we reccomend playing it in fullscreen mode), and it is also available as a download for Windows and Mac. However, we can't provide support for Mac or promise that it works.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Design: Rebecka Hedlund (me!)
