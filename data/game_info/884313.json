One player is able to freeze and unfreeze interactables in the map to create a way forward, while the other freezes enemy turrets in place as protection from harm.\r\n</p>\r\nPlot\r\n<p>The story of It\u2019s About Time focuses onto two companions with the ability to locally manipulate time using advance technology. The two differ in their applications of this technology, giving them different opportunities.\r\n  </p>\n<p>-The first is the WAYFINDER, who is able to freeze and unfreeze the passage of time on items indefinitely, doing so for the purposes of navigation and creating a path through the environment.<br/> -The second is the PALADIN, who is capable of freezing turrets that try to attack the two. Because trying to freeze these machines requires more effort, the Paladin can only freeze the turrets for a few seconds before they unfreeze.<br/></p>\n<p>The Wayfinder and the Paladin are exploring what should be an abandoned factory, that has since come back to life. In doing so, the defence systems have reactivated, posing a threat to the duo and forcing them to try and escape to their ship at the end of the level.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>In It's about Time, the Wayfinder uses Mouse and Keyboard, while the Paladin uses a controller.</p>\r\nWAYFINDER\r\n<p>Movement [WASD]\r\n</p>\n<p>Jump [SPACE]\r\n</p>\n<p>Freeze [R CLICK]</p>\n<p>Unfreeze [Q]</p>\r\nPALADIN\r\n<p>Movement [LEFT STICK]</p>\n<p>Jump [A/X]</p>\n<p>Freeze [RIGHT TRIGGER]</p>\r\nCredits\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>Developed by Ulti\r\n</p>\r\nAssets\r\n<p>The game would not have been possible without the following assets</p>\n<p>Free Stylized Textures\u00a0- LowlyPoly<br/></p>\n<p>LOWPOLY - Spaceship\u00a0- IV Games</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi Texture Pack 1 -\u00a0FireBolt Studios<br/></p>\n<p>All music was provided by\u00a0Bensound\u00a0and all sound by\u00a0Freesound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T15:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d1/1d1dd771fe6c6302ec7f2380d2e0f0d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UltiGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
