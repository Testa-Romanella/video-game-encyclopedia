The system generates a maze and you can run through it. The minimap shows a trail indicating where you have been. In this demo the chunk system does not itself follow the player's movement, so the maze is limited to a circle around the origin.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Click \"Play/Restart\" at the top left to generate the maze; if you find yourself trapped, click again to generate a new maze<br/>Left mouse and drag to control the camera view<br/>W/A/S/D to move<br/>Left Shift to run<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:32:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5cf/5cf3d95c336625af29b2acc40b9109cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["problemecium"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
