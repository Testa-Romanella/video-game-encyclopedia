{"id": 930865, "slug": "xxx_cyberrat_xxx", "name": "XXX_CYBERRAT_XXX", "name_original": "XXX_CYBERRAT_XXX", "description": "XXX_CYBERRAT_XXX is a hardcore horror &amp; hacking game with roguelike progress resets after death. It's a 2/3D hybrid game, where you will explore The Dark Web as a cybercriminal under the alias XXX_CYBERRAT_XXX, an infamous owner of a luxurious underground marketplace called TheDarkHub.<h3>Horror</h3>Your paranoid lifestyle has taken a toll on your mental health. As you explore The Dark Web, you will suffer from increasing anxiety. High anxiety will cause you to experience more servere hallucinations. To relieve some of your stress, you'll need to use your hard-earned cybercriminal money to buy medicine from a drug marketplace.<h3>Hacking</h3>Explore The Dark Web, solve hacking minigames and utilize OSINT (Open-source intelligence) tools to dox your enemies and eliminate them before they find you. Investigate your enemies by searching their phone number, online usernames, cryptocurrency addresses and other PII (Personally identifiable information).<h3>Hardcore</h3>This is a tough game and you will die many times. A combination of ever-increasing cost of your medicine, constant stream of hitmans sent by your competitiors and terryifing hallucinations caused by decreasing mental health will put you under constant pressure and challenge your gamer skills. Can you beat it? There's only one way to find out.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Intense</h3>Whether it's gathering money for your next medicine batch, defending from rival cybercriminals, upgrading your tools, solving hacking minigames, browsing The Dark Web or managing your applications, you'll never be left with nothing to do.<h3>Roguelike</h3>Every time you die, your whole progress is reset and you have to start over. A sucessful run takes around 90 minutes. Every death is explained and there are only minimal luck-based mechanics.<h3>Upgrade</h3>Use the experience gained from browsing The Dark Web to upgrade your tools and increase the profits of your cybercrime empire, allowing you to more efficiently defend from hitmans sent by your rivals and to afford your paranoia-relieving medicine.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T03:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b6fcbc7dc8d7096d91d4f2c836aadde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Small Indie Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Small Indie Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
