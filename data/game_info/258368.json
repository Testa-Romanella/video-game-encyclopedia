In this game, a player is required to find an exit for each stage by means of meeting certain conditions like, for example, triggering all the switches hidden separately within the map.<br/><br/>The player takes a role of one of the prisoners in Gildersvine, a kingdom in its prosperity through highly-developed mining industry. One day, a chance to walk free out of the imprisonment facility is given to the prisoner, in condition of winning a certain game held within Daedalic Complex where one has to find a piece of pardoning paper hidden deep inside the facility. The prisoner had no other options but to accept the offer, because there was no other way left for him/her.<br/><br/>Still, practically every single things in Daedalic Complex work against the prisoner on the quest for his/her own freedom. Under cruel level-designs of each map, exhausting combats with hideous monsters, resources frequently running low, and grueling conditions for survival, the prisoner has to find every possible means of achieving his/her ultimate goal, the pardoning paper. Even there is a moment of making a crucial choice where one's fate, be it seeing the light of outside once again or meeting the certain doom, will be determined. <br/><br/>To do so, one is required to explore, scavenge, and thus survive this whole Daedalic Complex. Dare to explore deep inside the dungeon, but be cautious of your remaining resources and companions while doing so. Gather all the things needed for survival, but expect that none of them will given freely nor easily. Find the exit that leads you out of each stage, but still, you will have to survive the place first. <br/> <br/><br/><br/><strong>Explore, scavange, and survive the Complex to see the light once again!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*Soundtracks and SE used in the promotional video above:<br/><br/>1.
