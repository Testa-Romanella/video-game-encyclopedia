The power is on, but it looks like no one is around. While you may think that the frigid cold is the only thing to worry about, the truth is that the Christmas Tree lot appears to be overrun by demonic X-mas tree demons. Will you be able to survive the night to see Christmas, will you freeze to death from the dreaded cold, or will you get chopped down by the Christmas Trees?<br/><br/>Of course, you could just leave whenever.<strong><br/><br/>GAME CONTROLS</strong><br/><strong>[W/A/S/D]</strong> - Move<br/><strong>[Mouse]</strong> - Look<br/><strong>[RMB]</strong> - Aim Firearm<br/><strong>[LMB]</strong> - Interact/(Aim) Fire<br/><strong>[E]</strong> - Interact/(Aim) Reload<br/><strong>[Q]</strong> - Drink Hot Cocoa<br/><strong>[F]</strong> - Flashlight<br/><strong>[Shift]</strong> - Run<br/><strong>[Space]</strong> - 180 Turn<br/><strong>[Esc]</strong> - Pause<br/><br/><em>Special thanks to Amy Lynch for assisting in the game's writing.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T00:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/157f82b9b8072fe75cddccc5b0055285.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["olinkalex"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
