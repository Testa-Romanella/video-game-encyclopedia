{"id": 99020, "slug": "stereophyta", "name": "Stereophyta", "name_original": "Stereophyta", "description": "<p><em>Stereophyta </em>is a <strong>virtual musical world</strong> in which all the elements strive to coexist in harmony. It is an experiment in player expression and player freedom. I wanted all storytelling to come through interaction, exploration, and the player\u2019s ability to listen. The ultimate goal of the game is to envelop players in a world of complexity that may at first seem overwhelming. As time progresses, the player is encouraged to<strong> observe</strong> and <strong>discover </strong>how all these elements are related and to see the potential therein to <strong>create music</strong> and order based on the ruleset.</p>\n<p>The ruleset is made up of <strong>three systemic pillars</strong>: rhythm producers, like the wind, rain, and the people who are made of rocks; sound producers, such as the plants and the rocks; and non-player characters, i.e. the people who form cultures and groups around these other elements. These systems transform the music-making process from one of memorization and skill, to one of <strong>spatial exploration and composition</strong>. </p>\n<p>Everyone has a different idea of what sounds \u2018good\u2019, of what music is, and of what noise is. These notions are often rooted in the contexts of both our language and our culture. I wanted to explore these conceptions and to understand how it is that humans were able to first hear music and thus, over millenia, develop the means to compose it. This means that inherently, the game\u2019s goal is illusive. The game beckons you to discover how it is constructed and what it means to exist in a place where the flow of time leads to no end.</p>\n<p><strong>*Note:\u00a0 The game\u00a0is still in development in Unity.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This is not the same Stereophyta as the one listed on @eastoned\u00a0 itch profile, though it is a continuation of the same project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45cb19dd3c443058b736d86ec8109447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["the static man"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
