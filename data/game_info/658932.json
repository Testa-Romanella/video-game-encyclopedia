The game was made in about 10 days, so we did the best we could in that amount of time. The player controls a dolphin with the normal WASD or arrow key controls. But later on they are able to echolocate in the darker levels. We were not able to implement all the levels and everything we wanted, but still enjoy the amazing landscape (or waterscape? idk).\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T10:24:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f43/f430a93ad5440e90457b85777e52cbc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Bkush"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
