He is half-god but also half-man, and so, the threat of mortality still plagues him. As he quests for the Elixir of Life, he harks back to epic battles, vicious gods, and his once beloved friend, Enkidu.<br/></p>\n<p>Shadows of Mortality was created for the Godot Wild Jam, for the theme of \u201cLost tech\u201d. This made us think of the lost technique of shadow puppetry (an ancient form of storytelling) as well as centuries-old quests for technology that were thought to grant eternal life. Note: There were a few game-play and story elements that were dropped for this Jam game, but we may include them in the future!<em><br/><br/><strong>This game is best played in fullscreen and using the downloadable version, so that your progress can be saved!</strong> Also, the narration and sound effects are much higher quality in the downloadable version!<br/><br/>CW: This game contains shadows of scorpion-like creatures.<br/></em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T04:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d462fc7190791a6ca03ac38fce4609cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["sage7", "mhm32167", "Sophiablabla"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
