EARTH SIZED)\r\n  </p>\n<p>DESCRIPTION:   </p>\n<p>Hydras 12 is an Earth-sized world; however, it is much closer to its parent star (Hydras Prime) than Earth is to Sol. Hydras is incredibly hot, possesses a single dense ring of dust, debris, and space junk, and is littered with all manner of technological detritus. At some point in its past Hydras was on the brink of habitability, however it appears that another intelligent and spacefaring species discovered the planet and elected to use it as an interstellar <em>dumping ground</em>. The planet\u2019s \u201cring\u201d is mostly composed of decommissioned ship hulls, abandoned satellites, rocket boosters, and other miscellaneous manufactured material.   </p>\n<p>The surface of the planet is thick with metal junk, crashed and/or decommissioned starships, and a vast number of trash-compacting pistons and metal-smelting smokestacks that are <em>still</em> in operation even hundreds of years after their estimated construction. The planet\u2019s oceans are rusty-red in color due to high amounts of oxidized iron alloys, and the planet\u2019s bitterly hot winds often stir up rust-based dust storms that fling particulates fast enough to strip paint off metal and flesh from bones. The planet, barely habitable in the first place, is a rusted hellscape due to the environmental destruction wrought by the precursor species.\r\n  </p>\n<p>POD MODIFICATIONS:\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the high winds and abrasive nature of Hydras 12\u2019s rust-sand and the corrosive properties of the planet\u2019s oxidized oceans, all exploration pods deployed to Hydras 12 are to be unmanned to preserve explorer safety. Pods should be equipped with thrusters for flight, as exposure to the planet\u2019s oceans will prove detrimental to pod operation. The pod should be as fast as is plausible and controllable, to avoid oncoming rust-storms.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The pod should be small; The wrecked ships, abandoned industrial facilities, and other artefacts left behind by the precursors could prove to be a wealth of technological information, and only a small pod will be able to move amidst the fuselages in the wreckage.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The primary objective of this expedition is to scan and catalogue as many unique forms of alien technology as can be found upon the planet\u2019s surface, identify the power sources that maintain the machinery that is still functional, and try to ascertain what the <em>purpose</em> of the precursor actions on this planet are.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The planet has no moons, but Hydras Prime (the system\u2019s red sun) is close enough to the planet that even the planet\u2019s <em>nights</em> are more like twilight on Earth.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T09:05:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c7ada4d884ba3443e745b148d7cb967.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0ran_da"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
