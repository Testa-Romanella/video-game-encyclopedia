A few years after, we needed someone strong to go see what the world had become. It was awful and<strong> I got stabbed</strong> by a little elf out there. I had no other choice but to <strong>come back</strong> to my people, however <strong>the sword in my chest was kind of a problem</strong>. I needed a fast way to go home, the <strong>dwarven elevator</strong> seemed like the best idea, but it\u2019s really dangerous because of the hundreds of monsters living there. I didn\u2019t want to die because of <strong>blood loss</strong>, but pulling the sword out would have been suicide, I would have bleed out. I knew that <strong>monsters hate human blood</strong>, so maybe if <strong>I stabbed myself a bit deeper, and a bit deeper</strong> I could survive long enough and find my people. I only knew I had to try.</p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>\"Space key\" : Dash</p>\n<p>\"Enter\" : Stab Yourself</p>\n<p>\"E\" : PowerUp</p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>This was my second Jam and it's only my third game, but it was great to do the Jam.\u00a0Theme was : <strong>\"Deeper and Deeper\"</strong></p>\n<p>The Game is too difficult for now, that will change with patches</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:03:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6d/e6dca7a76b3afe2b28c4f2449f4aa2c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Shin0nome"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
