Well that's cognitive flow created because you know the route and the general patterns of the commute so your mind falls in to cognitive flow and creates authentic happiness which is why you never feel negative about not remembering your journey.</p><p>The idea is to support mental health by removing the taboos that still surround it because people still don't understand it and therefore don't believe it's real. Missing Pixel wants to show visually how darkness can surround a person mentally and that help and support is like little pockets of light.</p><p>Missing Pixel: Glimmer of Light will also try to create cognitive flow which in turn should help improve the levels of happiness self-generated by the user but with help from the games balance.</p><p>Any money made will be donated to Mind UK.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3b/e3b3ebebd5ddabbc744d1de805bc701d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Backpack Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
