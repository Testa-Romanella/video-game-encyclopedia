You will be the winner if you can pass all these 6 waves.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you so much for playing this game. I really appreciate it!</p>\n<p>This is my very first game and it is also the first time I'm joining a game JAM. The JAM forces me to study a lot about game development. I will definitely join the next JAM.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:32:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/786/786605309680b5dd3a503529e705c210.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hzung"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
