It is a bridge builder where you route cars to their correct locations and repair bridges as you go. Bridges will deteriorate as more and more cars drive over them. The player can spend money to repair a certain percentage or all of a bridge's health. Trucks appear with gadgets and money to help you repair your bridge and getting cars to the right place gives you money as well.<br/><br/>I worked on this project with Evan Norzow, Isaac Lovy, and Lucas Simmons. I was responsible for the repairing function, UI (including tooltips), the camera, and player movement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T07:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d8/7d887120cc97abbd35c91110eef3823c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dillondrum70"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
