A lot of really cool games have been made nonetheless, many from the paradise server. Check the rest out here!<br/><br/>For posterity, this is the google translated english paragraph description on which I entirely based my game:</p>\r\nYou control a small reindeer who must catch as much food as possible, it is bread and blackberries. The more you catch, the faster the food goes and the harder it is to catch it. At the top right you see that there is your dashboard, each fished food is worth a point. And on the top left, there's a panel that shows you how many foods you haven't caught. Caution ! after about ten food items not caught, you lose and the game then displays \" GAME OVER! then press enter to start over.  The controls are: right arrow to move right, left arrow to move left and up arrow to jump. It's so simple!\r\n\r\n<p>Made in Bitsy by Adam Le Doux</p>\n<p>using Pixsy by ruin</p>\n<p>there are 2 endings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T10:20:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/128416ed9935a421b5c7afa442ead48c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnLee Cooper"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
