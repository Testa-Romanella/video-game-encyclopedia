The game (and demo) are still a work in progress, with items such as materials, level layout and some mechanics subject to change. The demo gives you an idea on what the gameplay is like and if it is something you would like to see more of.</p>\n<p>The demo has replay-ability, with most of the puzzles having multiple solutions, as well as a sandbox level where you can toy around with the game mechanics and a creative solution puzzle, where you are given a majority of the game's mechanics (limited only by the number of ramps and large cubes) to\u00a0come up with your own solution (to access these levels, go to \"puzzle select\").</p>\n<p>The main elements of the demo featured are Ice and Glue. More will be added in a full release.</p>\n<p>The short video is from the sandbox level, and shows how the mechanics work and how they could be utilised.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Impractical Problems - What's your solution?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Donations are completely optional, but will help with ongoing development of the full release (although you playing the demo and giving feedback does too!).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/462/462e7e583289b5dbda489d1aea8063a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Misdirection Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
