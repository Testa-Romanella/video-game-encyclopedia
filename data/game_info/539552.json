The categorisation of colour and reference to the erotic drama 50 Shades of Grey explores the problematic fetishisation of people of colour both within and outside of the sex industry.\u00a0This game was made to highlight the lack of representation of POC in online space and to celebrate POC and difference between us. What does it feel like to see\u00a0something so political in society reduced to it's raw, digital pigment?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T04:39:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78f/78fa3f42dff5caa694006f851557901d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jmorris"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
