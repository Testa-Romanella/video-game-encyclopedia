Figure out the best \r\nway to make a sale by analyzing their personalities. Survive on a trip across a vast desert, and earn money to buy yourself a home in the Grand Capital!<br/><br/>Goals of the Game<br/><br/>Make\r\n as much gold as you can selling your wares to the various people and \r\ncreatures of the land by figuring out the perfect sales pitch. Find out \r\ninformation about each potential customer by asking them questions.Your \r\nstats determine how many times you can question them. You can threaten \r\nyour customers into buying your goods, appeal to their needs or have \r\nthem pity you. Each method not only drains their willpower but your own \r\nas well. If the customers willpower runs out, then they will buy your \r\ngoods. Run out of willpower, and you will lose out on money. Keep your food and medicine supplies in check, otherwise it's gameover!</p><p>Controls<br/>Everything is pretty much controlled using a mouse based UI. No confusing arrow keys or button combos to worry about!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2349bc33cefb6560a7dee6c523fa32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tomato Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
