There is a small town, far away from any city or business headquarters. It is only accessible by a long drive off an interstate. One could technically arrive via airplane. There are plenty of empty fields nearby. This town is productive, and has a lot of business and exports. And yet, not much actually comes into this town. The only regular visitors are trucks that drop off food, materials, and tools; and sleek cars that drive in at midnight.\"</p>\n<p>Bar\u00a0Talk is a short story featuring\u00a0four dialogues between civilians in a town plagued by gang fights, trying to keep their heads down\u00a0while still staying informed and in high spirits .</p>\n<p>This is an entry for ViNoWrimo 2020, and a side story for a worldbuilding project, with under 150 lines of dialogue. Care was taken for quality over quantity in time constraints.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T06:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/709/709d2f764c7450244096d65a6c129f55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Bechstein"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
