{"id": 754630, "slug": "monster-girl-manager-itch", "name": "Monster Girl Manager (itch)", "name_original": "Monster Girl Manager (itch)", "description": "<p>Monster Girl Manager is a monster-raising roguelite turn-based RPG that focuses on guiding a team of monster girls through dungeons.<br/></p>\n<p>All monster girls are procedurally generated from a player entered seed.\u00a0 Entering the same seed will always produce the same Monster Girl, so players can post seeds they have discovered for others to use. In addition to aesthetic traits like eye color and skin color, seeds also influence base stats and personality.</p>\n<p>Personality and monster type directly influence dialogue, skills, abilities, gift preference, and training preference. Monster girls have different strengths and weaknesses in battle so finding and training different team compositions is a core part of the gameplay loop.</p>\n<p>Dungeons are designed in a mystery dungeon roguelite style. Traverse a multi-floor dungeon filled with traps and enemies while managing the health and motivation of your team. Collect artifacts during a run that empower your team in battle.</p>\n<p>Players can upload their own sprites, dialogue, palettes, and dungeon layouts. No coding is required. Simply edit the included text files and restart the game. Monster Girl Manager reads easy to edit png and text files and includes readme files to aid in file manipulation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T16:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a13/a13e82799fac0622f7e45289ed1ca06c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nabladeveloper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
