{"id": 395858, "slug": "dollface-vr", "name": "Dollface VR", "name_original": "Dollface VR", "description": "<p>My first VR project, Dollface is a sandbox doll house where players can paint the walls, decorate a house, record music on the keyboard, cook from (initially limited) recipes, throw knives and play basketball with fruit,\u00a0 take photos,\u00a0make a mess, and clean it up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Follow the tutorial to learn to interact with game items like the Hifi, nail gun and laptop, and then continue with some easy tasks in the doll house to earn rewards and new stuff to play with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I made this in Unity 2019\u00a0with SteamVR 2.0 and the High Definition Render Pipeline for Unity. (HDRP). I made all the 3d and 2d assets in Blender, apart from a couple of free models I\u00a0used from the asset store - the bookcase, forks and spoons I\u00a0think. Most of the sound effects are from Freesound.org. Materials are from Unity's measured materials library, CC0 textures, and the rest were made by me using Substance Alchemist.</p>\n<p>Warning:\u00a0I have not been able to test on a huge variety of devices so performance may vary! I would love to hear about it if something doesn't work or acts weird for you so I\u00a0can improve it for more people. I've been using Unity /C#\u00a0for around 9 months so I\u00a0have a lot to learn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>////////</p>\n<p>Saying that, if\u00a0 there's anything I\u00a0did right and you are interested in how it was done, I'm happy to share code.</p>\n<p>////////////////////////</p>\n<p>Gameplay is open and experimental</p>\n<p>I wanted to make something for people\u00a0with no game experience and perhaps negative ideas of computer games\u00a0and newcomers to VR in particular, and emphasis has not been on creating a challenge or a game to complete, but on building a VR-first world that shows and works with what's different about this medium.</p>\n\n<p>////////////////////////</p>\n<p>Technical spec and Non-VR support</p>\n<p>Runs on a HTC Vive and Oculus Rift for sure, presumably would also work on newer headsets that run SteamVR\u00a0such as Valve's Index and Vive Pro, as well as Windows Mixed Reality.<br/></p>\n<p>Limited non-VR functionality:\u00a0There's fallback for non VR - loading it without a headset should launch in 3D mode with a fallback red dot hand and keyboard movement. This works pretty well for grabbing things but it's very fiddly for using the laptops / keyboards. Runs ok on a laptop that can't handle a high end VR headset, but probably requires dedicated graphics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:29:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/098/0985b701ead9cc91a400e3169086b78a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fishluck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
