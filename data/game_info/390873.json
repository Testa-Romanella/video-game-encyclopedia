You hold up/down to choose the direction you are rowing in. Then you row with the corresponding oar using\u00a0left/right. So to go forwards you'd want to row with the both oars at the same time. You can also hold specific buttons for each oar\u00a0to \"break\" i.e. push the oar deep in the water to fight against the momentum.\u00a0You can combine these controls to make more advanced moves like spinning in place\u00a0by rowing in the opposite directions with each oar or make quick turns at high speeds by\u00a0breaking with just one oar making the boat turn\u00a0etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:00:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e75/e7532e2a3dc5146082d346dcbf7d0e25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1N07", "Hegeteus"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
