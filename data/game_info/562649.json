We also fixed an issue with the player falling through the floor by the ladders AFTER the exit door is opened.<br/><br/><br/>THIS IS OUR FIRST REAL ATTEMPT AT A GAME  AND ONLY A PROTOTYPE. <br/><br/>A Lot still needs to be done but I figure I'd share a demo for playtesting to see what the people think. Take control of Heather the executioner as she carries out the death warrants of our benevolent AND malevolent dictator, Generalissimo Gruntin S. Veizatun. Chop off all prisoners heads in the dungeon to open the door to the next chamber but nothing comes easy so you'll have to go back to reach the exit! Avoid the underpaid possessed suits of armor, diabolical death wheels and gruesome Gruntgoyles that plague Gruntin's Dungeon! There's also spikes...ouch. Look for secret rooms that contain bonus collectables and extra lives!<br/></p>\n<p>The demo features 7 levels and 1 Secret Room!</p>\n<p>Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>\n<p>Made in NESMaker:</p>\n<p>https://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/<br/><br/>From PewKo Games, Licensed by the Transfatylvanian Ministry of Video Executions.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:37:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77c8abb88c6d945054bffb07d559e877.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["generalgruntin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
