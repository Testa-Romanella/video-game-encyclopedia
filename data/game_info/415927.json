I tried to follow the theme, but I really underestimated how hard it is to find an idea and actually create it in such a short and pressured time. The laser beam of the turret changes along with the song, matching it's sample, creating a \"frequency chart\" like effect. That counts..... right?</p>\n<p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>\n<p>FREQBEAM is a very basic arcade like turret shooter. Shoot the pesky notes as they fall from the sky. Let too many of them pass and you lose! With each round you survive, you receive a perk credit that you can spend in upgrading your turret. Matching (or surpassing/being surpassed by) those annoying notes. It in theory can go on forever, although there are caps on the upgrades to prevent you specing completely in damage and 1 tapping everything. So eventually they will outpower you.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Song:\u00a0Cyberpunk Moonlight Sonata</p>\n<p>Laser sound: Laser Shot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/756/756097a4f1799c5467ba2d4992c0a125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Owain"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
