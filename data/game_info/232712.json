To play the Plates travel game, see how many different vehicle license plates you and your family can find on your road trip. As you find a license plate, check it off your list. Work as a family in the car, or individually, while you travel. Play just for one trip, or keep your game going as long as you want! This can be a family project as you build your collection of license plate sightings together. You can save each game and then compare results with previous games. License plates are available from the countries of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.<br/><br/>There are a total of 114 license plates included in the Plates travel game:<br/><br/>\u2022 68 U.S. license plates: one for each of the U.S. 50 states, one for Washington D.C., one for the U.S. Government, five for the U.S. territories, and eleven for special causes and professions.<br/>\u2022 13 Canada license plates: one for each of the 10 Canadian provinces, and one for each of the 3 Canadian territories.<br/>\u2022 33 Mexico license plates: one for each of the 31 Mexican federated states; one for Customs, and one for the Mexico City Federal District.<br/><br/>Includes language support for English, French, and Spanish.<br/><br/>Let us know if you want us to include other special U.S., Canada, or Mexico license plates.
