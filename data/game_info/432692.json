The downloadable demo contains four levels and was deemed quite addictive! :-D</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Please donate to fund my development!</strong></p>\n<p>A fast paced arcade game, full of wanton urban destruction. Inspired by countless block breaker games but attempting to break [sic!] their mold with a modern twist.</p>\n<p>World Wreckers sees you in the role of a deconstruction worker, working for a large mining conglomerate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several towns need to be razed, to make space for a new open-cast coal mine, because don't we all need more coal? At least our shareholders do!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, your trusty wrecking machine will get the job done, by firing a massive, but elastic, projectile. This ball of destruction can rebound off your vehicle's armored sides as well as off buildings, effectively blowing them apart in the process!</p>\n<p><strong>Next development step:\u00a0Flying debris! And of course more levels!<br/>Please leave comments and\u00a0report any bugs and suggestions\u00a0to lea.creative.industries@gmail.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbd4da48d26d661c5855ea04d8745b08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lea Creative Industries"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
