It's <strong>Eaccoonger\u00a0</strong>and welcome to my second game made with Bitsy! <em>This is Not Pork\u00a0</em>is based on a story I wrote a few years back and it is\u00a0<em>a lot\u00a0</em>more story based than my first Bitsy game,\u00a0<em>Computer Tabs.\u00a0</em>So be prepared to read everybody!\u00a0<em>This is Not Pork\u00a0</em>is a 24 to 30 minute interactive story about Natsuo (or MC) and his classmate Kino. Kino has invited Natsuo over to his house to work on a school project together, but... his house... This can't be his house, can it? It's... filthy... And, his family... He can't be related to them... And... That door... That metal door? Where does it lead?</p>\n<p>Tip #1:  So, to help you all out, I'm gonna tell you a few things. There are\u00a0<em><strong>red flashing circles\u00a0</strong></em>that you need to move your avatar/cursor to in order to get the description on the item or progress to the next room. My first tip to you:\u00a0<strong><em>Attack the circles from the bottom. Move your cursor to the bottom of the circle because some circles won't give you information unless you attack from the bottom and I don't want you all to be stuck only have been playing the game for two minutes.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Tip #2:\u00a0<strong><em>Interact with EVERYTHING before progressing down the hallway or examining doors.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Note(s): This is only my second game, so please don't come at me with \"There's too much dead space in rooms 13, 17, and 20!\" or \"You made grammatical errors in the description of\u00a0\u00a0[insert item] in [insert room].\" or \"I can't get past the first room!\" because I am\u00a0<strong>well\u00a0</strong>aware of my flaws in this game. I can't tell you how many times I played through my own game to check for spelling errors. This is why I'm giving you tips and yelling you before hand \ud83d\ude01 I hope you all enjoy this game! I worked really hard and spent so much time making this, and I realize there are a few flaws, but I'm proud of my work! I don't really intend on making games\u00a0<em>super seriously\u00a0</em>but rather as a little hobby, ya know? I'm just trying to have a little fun do something that will make me and other people happy. But me being the anxious and obsessive person I am, I sometimes panic over small details, imperfections,\u00a0what others think of me, and just unnecessary things I shouldn't be worrying over. That's why I'm making this note for you all \ud83d\ude01 Just want to let you all know to go easy on me, okay? I realize some of my games may have flaws here and there, but I'm doing this all to make you guys happy and a little less bored during quarantine! But still, please play my games \ud83d\ude06</p>\n<p>I made 2 YouTube videos of me playing the game (No commentary though). I also don't have custom thumbnails because I'm not verified on YouTube yet, but the videos are there in case you get stuck!</p>\n\n\n<p>Love you all! Stay safe ma dudes! \u270c</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T04:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77b/77bb7e0078339199cb87f843007b6e46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Eaccoonger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
