Dig through decades of teams to find your favorite All-Stars and even unlock the \"Legends\" in an immersive story mode.<br/><br/>This game is a passion project for us indie developers here at Namo Gamo. We hope you can feel the love put into every pixel, the endless adjustments to stat-driven gameplay, and the genuinely retro sound and music.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f87/f877aea180819de93ebea4415963402f.jpg", "website": "http://namogamo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Namo Gamo"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Namo Gamo"], "esrb_rating": null}
