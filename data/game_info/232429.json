As they start exploring and discovering Tinker Island, they find great treasures, forage resources, build buildings and items that they need to gather, craft, build or harvest to protect themselves against the unfamiliar environment and the dangerous episodes awaiting them. A normal guy, a tourist onboard a ship, is forced to become a forager, a fighter, a true hero in this mini world adventure game. Find mysterious ancient villages and buildings, left behind by either wayward settlers or scum, discover an unknown civilization, uncover steampunk contraptions, covered with rust and almost unidentifiable. Not only is there no wifi in the caves on the islands, the whole thing is nowifi. <br/><br/>As you progress and craft the needed tools, you slowly uncover the map, the monument, valley, the stars, the mountain and the treasures of the islands. If things don't pan out, retry. And then retry again. One hour, one life, yolo. There is plenty of wit and humor in the narrative, where you have to make the correct choices to progress through the story. Gather the needed resources to upgrade your buildings and unlock new areas and even new islands. Some are deserted islands, some are tiny islands with mysterious pasts, you may even come upon a Kraken. Maybe build a colony, a whole civilization in the rim of the world, but most of all, survive and complete the quests.<br/><br/>If you enjoy adventure games, survival games or even board games, this is definitely a game worth giving a go. It's a real treasure.<br/><br/>\u2620 WARNING! No wifi on the island.
