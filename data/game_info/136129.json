(ONE COMPUTER/GAME LEADER IS NECESSARY, AND ONE MORE COMPUTER OR ANDROID DEVICE FOR EACH PLAYER.) IF YOU JUST DOWNLOAD THIS AND START FOOLING AROUND YOU'LL HAVE A BAD TIME.  IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY REALLY BUGGY WITH LARGER PLAYING GROUPS.</strong><br/></p><p>This is basically a lot like that party game about werewolves or that party game about members of organized crime where everybody has a secret identity, except you use a cell phone or laptop to perform all your secret actions.</p><p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong></p><p>A group of aliens have disguised themselves as humans and are about to take over the world, but a small group of real humans have infiltrated their ranks.  Your phone/laptop will tell you whether you are actually an alien or human, but you can't show anybody else your screen throughout the entire game.  You have to figure out who is who based off of behavior and conversation.</p><p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p><p>Every day in the game, anybody can call a vote to execute any other player, at which point everybody will vote on their phones.  Higher than 50% is needed to execute the player.  Aliens win when all humans have been killed.  Humans win when all aliens have been killed.</p><p>Both roles have a unique ability that they can use once per turn.  Aliens have psychic abilities, and can telepathically send a heart to any other player.  If they other player is also an alien, they will receive the heart.  Humans have assassination abilities, and can murder any alien in the middle of the night, but if there is more than one human, they both must select the same alien to assassinate, otherwise no assassination takes place.  (The humans can find out who eachother are by looking at who is missing from the assassination list.)</p><p><strong>SET UP:</strong><br/></p><p>There needs to be one \"server\" computer (PC), run by a dungeonmaster of sorts, who does not participate as a character, but is the narrator of the game.  Nobody should be able to see his/her screen.  This computer needs to be on a local area network with any other players (with wifi for any mobile users).  The network must have an open port, which you can select.  Each other player can be either a PC computer or an Android phone.</p><p>Upon setting up the server, the dungeonmaster selects a port (try using the default port first).  Write this number down, and then you need to obtain your local IP address.  The easiest way to do this is to hit the windows key, search for and run \"cmd\" (the command prompt), and then type \"ipconfig\" into the command prompt.  Scroll up to where it says \"IPv4 Address\".  You need to tell this address to all of the players in the game.  Once the server is up, the phones can connect one at a time, entering their name, the ip address, and the port.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p><p>The client controls are somewhat straight forward.  There's a button on the bottom of the screen.  For aliens, it opens the player list to send a heart, for humans it opens the player list to set your assassination vote.  (The assassination vote can be changed at will.)</p><p>The server controls are as follows:</p><p><em>Space Bar - </em>This advances the day (and starts the game.)<br/></p><p><em>Left Mouse Click On Player </em>- This calls for an execution vote for this player.<br/></p><p><em>Right Mouse Click On Player </em>- This manually changes a players role.  (Don't do this in game unless you want weird results.)<br/></p><p><em>1-9</em> - This randomly assigns that number of humans into the group before the game.<br/></p><p><em>Escape - </em>This stops the game and resets everything.<br/></p><p><strong>SOME NOTES:</strong><br/></p><p>The networking on this game isn't super robust, so don't intentionally try to break it by hitting buttons on the server like crazy.  It will probably break.</p><p>Programming and Horrible Programmer Art by Brian Peters</p><p>Tell Corinne to make real art.</p><p>At some number of players, the game does become unstable.  I'm not sure what number that is though.  It's set up for up to 16 players, but I don't think it works with 16.  You get what you pay for.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbd/bbdf0afc6157c4542c9b085ee45643b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["grandtheftmarmot"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
