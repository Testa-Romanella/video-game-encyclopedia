Bullets will pass stright through walls, and your weapon's secondary fire gives you xray vision to let you see the enemies.</p>\n<p>Be warned though, as while using xray vision you will appear visible to the other players.<br/></p>\n<p>Escape will release your mouse, Escape + shift will close the game. (Sorry for the lack of UI).<br/></p>\n<p>Currently singleplayer, fighting against rather stupid bots.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4abfd2e17ddf04efb6e66c61ac25f833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mickeyjm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
