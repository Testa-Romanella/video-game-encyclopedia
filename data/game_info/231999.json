Handwritten input is the most natural for children, no more multiple choice questions or distraction through keyboard input. With our apps kids can better focus on tasks and get a chance to improve their handwriting.<br/><br/>This app was designed to help children to learn and practice multiplication tables. The app features multiplication tables from 1 to 12. At first all problems are presented in a sorted order, later for better learning experience the order is switched to random. You can review where your math skills are weaker, this is especially great for parents who want to see where their child may need help and more practice.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f8c8cd2d4f7c8e3b5552b78395500c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Sergey Malugin"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
