But there was a group of employees who, due to drinking too much, fell asleep at the company and were accidentally locked up. In the middle of the night, they accidentally woke up and met horrifying scenes. So how can they get out of the company and go home? And what is happening outside of the company? Everything depends on your IQ. Note: The game is extremely difficult in the process of finding the way and finding the objects. Should consider before playing.
