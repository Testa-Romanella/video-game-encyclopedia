Your space ship is slowly pulled towards the goal. But look out there are other aliens an asteroids in the way. Click to tether yourself to another object and \"control\" your direction. Don't collide with anyone or you might not reach the other side. Keep in mind your tether only keeps a maximum distance to the other object, so its no use on an object that about to collide with you.</p><p>Have fun hurling through space!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T07:30:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b159d87c601cb7cd6aec47ddeb414d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["therookies", "MrLaetoli", "t0BEE", "thelokalnub"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
