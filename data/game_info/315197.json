I still have class and events these days so I actually spend only 20 hours on it. I would say the game is technically complete but also incomplete as well. It has got most basic functions of a game but still lacks a lots of assets like music or sound, complete and better graphics, etc. Or you can say it`s just a prototype.</p>\n<p>The idea of this game is from me and my bro SALTY. It begins with \u201ccreating a trade-off between life amount and game difficulty\u201d, like, you can buy \u201ceasiness\u201d by paying(decreasing) life amount, or earn life amount by taking higher difficulties or handicaps. Then the idea goes further to :\u201dwhat if the player has to buy \u2018everything\u2019 with their life amount?\u201d So the only thing you`ll see when opening the game is your life amount and a icon of \u201cshop\u201d, because you need to buy everything else(including character, the button to start the game and UI).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88f/88f6cf2cce8b642e86c67f3da99b1a55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Decappoolla"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
