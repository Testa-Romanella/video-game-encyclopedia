Or to enjoy yourself if you're after a stress-free experience.</p><p>The Lighthouse Keeper has invited you to stay but when you arrive on their island you find they have abandoned their post and have left a series of clues leading to their hidden treasure.</p><p>Played in first-person (with a choice of standard or simplified controls) the player can simply wander the relaxing tropical island with no aim, or perhaps discover the hidden treasure chest that holds a special prize.  </p><p>Finding and opening the chest will require some mild puzzle solving but most people should succeed in 10-30 minutes.</p><p>Please contact me if you get stuck or need any hints @StoneBakedGames.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/746/74628663fb8158fc69841797356f810c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Stone Baked Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
