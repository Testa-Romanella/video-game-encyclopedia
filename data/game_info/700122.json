There are no other consequences except for missing notes which will lead to failing the song after a certain time. The hitbox might be a bit funny in certain parts and also the meter on the right may not drop down or add precisely but I hope it's all good. I don't want to make the game to difficult in ways and too easy either but Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T08:50:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06cd84fd346b9ce3f7fd0d5b3d2a204b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BeakGaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
