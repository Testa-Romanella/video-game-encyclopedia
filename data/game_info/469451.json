Hopefully if people enjoy this it will eventually grow into the next big survival game. The game itself is a basic wave survival with each wave being the same as of now. The player has one minute to gather resources before skeletons start spawning. The skeletons continue to spawn for two minutes, then the time resets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T04:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/4969c34afe96bd14deb2bd8ec29fc22d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keroro21"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
