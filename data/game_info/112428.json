{"id": 112428, "slug": "nimshooter", "name": "NimShooter", "name_original": "NimShooter", "description": "<p>NimShooter, a little space vertical shooter based on the work of ImpBox (www.youtube.com/embed/EwM1Z3WdqjM), using the Nim programming language and Nico, a framework (created by ImpBox as well) based on the pico-8 apis.<br/><br/>The video is the 1st part of the creation process of a game for the CGA Jam, but the 2nd part never came out. So I\u00a0took the work done until that moment and I completely rewrote it OOP style as a programming exercise, changed the palette (from 4 to 16 colors CGA), added an explosion animation and the starfield, a title scene and a basic highscore system, sounds, and polished the gameplay a little. It took me a few days to complete it, I\u00a0learned a lot about this fantastic programming language and generally I had fun programming it\u00a0:D<br/></p>\n<p>I am releasing this little game for Linux, Windows and Mac, plus the source code in Nim for educational purposes. Sorry if the code lacks some comments, but I\u00a0think that the code is fairly legible as it is.\u00a0You can fork it, use the\u00a0graphics/sounds as you like, do whatever you want with it.<br/>(P.S. The 'A' key actually is the 'Z' on a pc keyboard!)</p>\n<p>(This game needs the SDL2 and libsndfile dlls\u00a0installed in your system, if you are using Windows please download one of the file provided below\u00a0(32 or 64 bit, according to your system architecture) and put the dlls\u00a0in the same directory of the exe file. In case of using a Mac, please install SDL2 and libsndfile with brew)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df262bda3827f40bf754833589a44608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["badchosenname"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
