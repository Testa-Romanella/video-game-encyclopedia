Due to the structure of your tank, you can't go on the dark tiles, but Zombies can (and bullets fly)<br/></p>\n<p>The more lives you lose, the more out of control your tank becomes, but the world around you changes for your benefit. At 2 lives, the tiles on the top left and bottom right activate, granting you a special item. At 1 live, your bullets will pierce.</p>\n<p>But beware, your bullets might start to like the zombies...<br/></p>\n<p>The difficulty of the game will change depending on the window size you chose. At smaller sizes, zombies are slower, but you can see less. It's a tradeoff of control over the situation.</p>\n\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>Move with WASD.<br/>Rotate your cannon with the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.<br/>Shoot with SPACE (it's possible to hold space).<br/>Pause using ESCAPE.<br/>Toggle fullscreen using F11.</p>\n\n<p>The game was made with the L\u00d6VE game framework.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917cbb2b22f75a84454f12ce10cb7cac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["totallynotadolphin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
