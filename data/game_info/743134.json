Like Colour Shmup, the Unity version of Bomb Stopper is significantly improved (too bad you can't play the old version to see how much better the new game is!). When I originally came up with the idea,\u00a0I\u00a0thought it would be neat to make a game that could help people to improve their typing or spelling, but still be entertaining.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Type the words you see on-screen before the time runs out and the bomb explodes.\u00a0</li><li>If you type the words correctly without errors or corrections, you can get combos that add a multiplier to your score.</li><li>Incorrect words will result in a stun, where you cannot type for a duration.</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The downloadable version will allow you to copy and paste your results wherever you like.
