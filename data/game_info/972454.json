Play as Will and Ari as you battle the prophet Sybilla and the invading Omniety, an alien being reshaping the planet to its whims. Use your wits, powers, and even the enemies themselves to find an exit to every maze and save Antinomia and its people from certain destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCreated by OnlineVideoSurfer, Mazes and Labyrinths features over 70 puzzles in the main campaign plus a robust level editor to make and play your own levels. For more dedicated players, most levels also feature a bonus medal to truly test your ability to break the game. The goal is an almost arcade-puzzle experience, with short, bite-sized levels that nevertheless disguise deeply complex, rule-based design. Learning the intricacies of the powerups, the enemies, and the full implications of your abilities is essential to both mastering the campaign and making your own mazes for others.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPersevere and overcome the challenges and you will hopefully find a rewarding puzzle game that, by the endgame, will push your reasoning to its limits. For everyone that tries, I wish you luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T03:28:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3ad269573d32d3223cfdec54ba69fdf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OnlineVideoSurfer"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["OnlineVideoSurfer"], "esrb_rating": null}
