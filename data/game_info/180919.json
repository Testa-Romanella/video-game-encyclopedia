We also weren't able to complete all the artwork, but it was a great experience and we'll definitely be doing more games in the future, and we will be completing this game outside of the jam - the design exists and it's just a matter of time!</p>\n<p>There's also some bonus unused artwork in there, like the classic omelette, french omelette, and southwestern-style omelette. Hopefully one day this game will use\u00a0them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3e/b3ea915878a531072d34773657229acb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Radiel Dancliffe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
