I have to say every time the theme is not fit to my preparation...but finally got it done, a six-in-a-row game. You may be familiar with five-in-a-row, but five is far too easy for my game, so I raised to 6</p><p>here is the instruction of my work:</p><p>1.This is a six-in-a-row game,who makes a row of six block with same color wins. All 4 direction count(\u2191\u2193,\u2190\u2192,\u2196\u2198,\u2199\u2197)</p><p>2.This is a 2-player game due to its very type, but 1 person play 2 roles is also kind of fun</p><p>3.Players will take turns to click the spheres around the map, then the sphere will change its color,1 in red, 1 in blue</p><p>4.The color of every block depends on 4 sphere of its corner,</p><p>if red&gt;blue , show red, </p><p>if red&lt;blue , show blue, </p><p>if red=blue , show yellow(yellow won't affect game resault)</p><p>5.Again,who makes a row of six block with same color wins.</p><p>You can find the instruction in game too, finally I have to say UE4 is not suitable for small games like this, for the file size is too large(105Mb uncompressed).What's in it?</p><p>15Mb for the game content I created,37Mb for the engine file, 38Mb for the system setup file, and 80Mb for the PhysX!!!!(luckily I found 70Mb of PhysX is pdb and deleted them)</p><p>That's all, in Chinese '6' could mean \"good at\". So, How 6 could you be in my game?</p><p>Source project is packed in the 7z file,you may need UE4.11.1 to open it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/7191dcd63353ec90d94a042713dda070.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpiritJZL"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
