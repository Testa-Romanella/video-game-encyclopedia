You're the world's best post-rock band, Sky Burns Red, and you're having the most thematic concert - at a ran-down old platform in the woods. Just perfect... aside from the way it kinda falls over when you have a lot of people on it. Never matter, you can just keep it standing up yourself!</p>\n<p>Play TWO songs, one with three different difficulties, as you try to keep the platform up.</p>\n<p>Use the left and right arrow keys, A and D, or left and right bumpers, to hit the notes and push the platform up. Collect powerups by hitting the correct direction! The wrench fixes the platform, and the happy face makes the crowd happier! If the crowd gets angry, they'll destroy the platform!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left - A, Left Arrow, Left D-Pad, or Left Bumper</p>\n<p>Right - D, Right Arrow, Right D-Pad, or Right Bumper</p>\n<p>There's also a beatmap editor mode. You can only use the threeish pieces of music included with the game, but you can indeed beatmap them yourself!</p>\n<p>Editor Controls</p>\n<p>Up - Up Arrow, W</p>\n<p>Down - Down Arrow, D</p>\n<p>Add Note - Space</p>\n<p>Add Left Powerup 1 - U</p>\n<p>Add Left Powerup 2 - I</p>\n<p>Add Right Powerup 1 - O</p>\n<p>Add Right Powerup 2 - P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b6a2739c63cb28ec6a694b94f1aa143.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nardandas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
