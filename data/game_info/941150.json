Survive the endless hordes of bugs or at least take down as many as you can with you. Use an arsenal of weapons to kill bugs. That is the whole game all you do is kill bugs. You can build strategy of when to use each weapon to give yourself the best chance for a high score or you can sit in the corner with a pistol. (Both viable one is way more viable than the other) So basically all you do is kill bugs. Kill the bugs!</p>\n<p>(Game is built for whatever my computer is in terms of aspect ratio, you can play it on whatever you want I just don't know if it will look very good as I don't know how to account for that yet\u2665)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T14:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/398127a2d538ecded983b37156164f7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyrone McClanahan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
