There is, however, a twist. The evil Megabyte has corrupted the many strings of code and\u00a0if at any point you run into a 1, in the many 1s and 0s of binary, you will take damage.\u00a0\u00a0Along the way you will encounter bytes, levers, bonus rooms, pressure plates and portals as well as upgrades such as extra hearts and a shield that will protect you from all 1 damage for 10 seconds. The puzzles won't solve themselves, so go ahead, play and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Info about the Dev.</p>\n<p>As a 15 year old game developer, this is my second time participating in a game jam and although the game may not be perfect, I had a blast making it and I hope you enjoy playing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W / Up Arrow - Up</p>\n<p>S / Down Arrow - Down</p>\n<p>A / Left Arrow - Left</p>\n<p>D / Right Arrow - Right</p>\n<p>Spacebar - Interact</p>\n<p>P - Pause</p>\n<p>M - Mute Music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T06:00:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05cbf026f67bb85d7557bae56a06733.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SwordSkills749"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
