Where am I? What happened here?</em></p>\n<p>No Escape is a vision of a horror game that features classic psychological event-driven horror but appeals to a wide demographic. Like the FPS Horror greats it strives to have creepy and scary events that will make your skin crawl. At the same time, it features user friendly interactions, short levels and compelling gameplay to appeal to non-horror gamers. Because of it's short levels we push replayability through procedurally generated levels and intelligent dynamic events. Eventually we'd like to also incorporate branching choices, mutually exclusive areas and player responsive endings to encourage replayability\r\n</p>\n<p>You'll never have fun as long as you don't run away....?</p><p>$200 PRIZE - Horror Jam - AI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T11:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183842e04dc8604027ce9600e565c469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IHONG"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
