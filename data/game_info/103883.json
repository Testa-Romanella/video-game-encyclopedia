Once you're sick of the volcano hole, you can practice swings and topple blocks in the driving range. Everybody hates the volcano hole.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>How to play:</strong><br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Raise </strong>your hand to teleport to the stopped ball.</li>\n<li><strong>Rotate </strong>hand while raised to orbit the camera around the ball. (We zero out your initial rotation each time you raise it.) </li>\n<li><strong>Lower </strong>your hand in, and rotating your hand smoothly to hit the ball. (The club is tied to the center of your downfacing palm.)\r\n\t</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Keys:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Alt+Enter</strong> full screens the game (of course)<br/>\n</li>\n<li><strong>M</strong> is for Mulligan. In case you or the Leap Motion really flubs a shot, you're encouraged to tap this key.</li>\n<li><strong>ESC</strong> takes you back to the menu, and from there quits the game.</li>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>Tips:</strong>\n</p><ul>\n<li>I use my left hand, because it seems to track better, and is comfortable. </li>\n<li>Keep your fingers spread. This increases tracking accuracy.</li>\n<li>Swing smoothly. Too fast, and the physics engine will fail you. </li>\n<li>Stay out of the sand traps. You'll get sand in your shoes.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n</ul><p>\n<strong>System Requirements:</strong>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Windows 7/8/10 64 bit</li>\n<li>Leap Motion</li>\n<li>nVidia GTX 580 or newer equivilant</li>\n<li>Not VR!
