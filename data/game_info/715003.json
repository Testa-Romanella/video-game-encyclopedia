The fighter models and animations and arena are fully made by me, but send me an email at ansharyan03@gmail.com if you'd like to use them in a project of your own, I'll be more than happy to see what you can come up with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:40:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46a/46a63e68167b08800478f8974fbb88fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ansharyan03"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
