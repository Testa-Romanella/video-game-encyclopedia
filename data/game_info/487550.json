Use 1, 2, and 3\u00a0 number keys to switch camera between the 3 characters. W,A,S,D to move.. arrow keys don't work well for this game.(all characters must make it to the end of the level to complete the level)(also spam attack on the switches because they don't work on first hit for some reason) TO ATTACK HIT THE RETURN KEY. Whenever a character dies the game will restart(only the player and wolf can die.. keep in mind that you can kill the other characters, and all characters hit when you press the return key) View the help menu to see more info about each character.\u00a0This is my first completed game, and my first game jam. Everything in the game was made by me in Unity and GarageBand. Most of the art was made before I started making this game. All scripts were made after the jam started except for the basic movement script. I will continue to add levels and squash bugs and glitches after the jam ends. Follow my page if you are interested in seeing my progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/318/318db7874593c25d2d628222cfcac9e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hazardous Sorbet"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
