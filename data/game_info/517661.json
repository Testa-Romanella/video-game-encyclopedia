{"id": 517661, "slug": "dinner-dash", "name": "Dinner Dash!", "name_original": "Dinner Dash!", "description": "<p>Dinner Dash! is\u00a0an arcade style game, where the player rushes to gather the ingredients for dinner from around the house before their mum gets home. The player adding the ingredients to the pot will have the chance to create an environmental hazard, which will restrict player movement. It will include a timer, giving the player a lose state if they can\u2019t make the meal before mum gets home. There's a score system that will multiply off the remaining time once the meal is completed. The player will have to read a note on the front door to find out the recipe, then remember it whilst collecting ingredients, or come back and check on the list again at the cost of time.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T03:54:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4b15e97e4de1829686bf16cc065b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rintar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
