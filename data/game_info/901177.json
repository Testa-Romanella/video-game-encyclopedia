The duel is decided in 3 rounds, with players getting 2 lives per round.\u00a0The game is built around a dynamic grappling hook that gives players a ton of mobility. To help deal with that, weapons are fairly deadly and generous, plus you can freeze time for a brief time to dial in a shot.</p>\n<p>My first 3D godot game :) I made this for the 2022 7DFPS jam, and I am reasonably happy with how it turned out. This is a late entry, as travel and sickness ate heavily into the jam's formal time window... that, and a probably spent waaaay too much time setting up dedicated servers and a simple matchmaking engine. The game servers run in the east coast of the US and northern Europe, and if you play far from these areas you'll probably see some lag.</p><p>I want to keep working on this. I think it's a little to difficult managing the grappling hook while also trying to shoot your opponent. I want to add a different objective to the rounds other than killing you opponent... like scoring points by swinging through hoops or something like that. The shooting can stay in as an alternate way of winning, but I\u00a0like the idea of someone winning by grappling skill alone.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<strong>Key</strong><strong>Action</strong>WASDMove aroundMouseLook aroundLeft mouse buttonFire weaponRight mouse buttonZoom inQChange weaponsESlow time for 2 secondsRReload weaponFFire/release grappling hookWARetract/loosen grappling hookALT +\u00a0EnterToggle fullscreen on/offESCRelease/capture mouse", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T11:54:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a52/a527a8b36de331add487595a88ba4eab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["cowboyscott"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
