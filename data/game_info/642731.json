And <em>they must be stopped</em>.</p>\n<p>Watch everyone\u00a0through the security monitors and send your guards out when you see something suspicous. But don't forget to\u00a0check\u00a0in the real guests, or you'll be out of a job!</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY/RELEASE NOTES</strong><br/></p><p>First up, this current version is a super-early prototype and is missing features and may crash or glitch out. Also, <strong>it currently needs to run windowed at 1920x1080 resolution or the UI will be off and you won't be able to play it properly.</strong> It should start off at the right\u00a0resolution, but if you're on a laptop with a smaller screen you may be out of luck :-/. Sorry about this - will try to fix it in the next day or two.</p><p>Also haven't had time to get a tutorial in the game yet, so here's what to do (WASD/mouse to move, left button to interact, right button to zoom in on stuff):</p><ul><li>You're the receptionist at a hotel, and you need to check the guests in while identifying IMPOSTER guests.</li><li>The GUEST REGISTER has the list of real guests. If someone tries to check in and they're not on the register, they're an imposter and you should press one of the red buttons (any one will do) to call a security guard to escort them out.</li><li>Even if the guest <em>is</em> on the register, they may still be an imposter! Watch the security monitors to see where they go. If they go to the correct room as shown on the guest register,\u00a0 they're a real guest and you don't have to worry. If they wander off to a <em>different</em> room they're an imposter.</li><li>If\u00a0you see an imposter heading to the wrong room, call security on the big red telephone and they can send a guard out to catch them. You'll have to tell security which\u00a0block of rooms to send the guard to - use the map on the wall to get an idea of the hotel layout (there's five blocks, A, B, C, D and E with eight rooms each).</li><li>If an imposter makes it to a room they'll stay there for two minutes before making their escape - you need to get a security guard to them before then.</li><li>While you're doing all this, don't forget to keep checking in new guests as they arrive! If you leave them at the counter for too long they'll get impatient and go to another hotel (bad for business!).</li><li>The game ends when all the guests are checked in (or left) and all the imposters are captured (or escaped). The guests and imposters are randomized each time you play.</li></ul><p><strong>HANDY HINTS!</strong></p><ul><li>You can set any of the four security monitors to any camera you like, but it's probably easiest to leave the three overhead monitors where they are and switch between close-ups on the lower left one.</li><li>Using the right mouse button to zoom in on the security monitors makes it much easier to see what's going on, especially when there's a lot happening.</li><li>If you send a security guard out to catch a real guest by mistake, the guard will realise when they reach the guest and return to the guard house.\u00a0</li><li>But\u00a0there's only four guards on site!\u00a0If they're all busy then security will be unavailable until one of them returns. Use them wisely!</li><li>For your\u00a0first couple of goes don't worry so much about trying to catch everyone, instead try to learn the layout of the hotel and get used to using the phone and security monitors.</li><li>Remember you only need to tell security which <em>block</em>\u00a0an imposter is hiding in, not the actual room. If you watch someone as they leave reception you can usually figure out which block they're heading to and send security out before the person makes it to the room.</li><li>Once some guests have checked in, room service will occasionally go out to their rooms. You can ignore them - they just wander around getting in the way (for now).</li><li>The scoring percentage system is completely broken right now and I don't know why \\o/. Expect new versions with bugfixes soon.</li></ul><p><strong>SO IS THIS A REMIX?</strong></p><p>Yes! It's a cut down and re-jigged version of a game design\u00a0I had earlier this year. That idea also had security monitors and the general idea of trying to catch people out, but it was set in an office building and had a bunch of other stuff as well. I'll probably write a devlog about it at some point\u00a0(it wasn't very good).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:38:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/240a7361e130b321a8aaa07757eaa43f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Harder You Fools"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
