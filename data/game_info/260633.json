It's up to you to figure out who done it. The local town monsters seem to have an idea of who the killer is. Shoot orbs that have an elemental type advantage over the opposing monster to defeat them, and they will either drop more orbs for you to use or a note that\u00a0hints at the killer's identity. When you have gathered at least 4 hints, click on the Ice NPC to pick out among the townsfolk who the killer is.</p>\n<p>Guess who the murderer is\u00a0correctly, and you win the game! If you guess wrong, or completely run out of orbs, you lose. The killer isn't always the same person every playthrough, so don't go thinking you've already won if you played before...</p>\n<p><em>Game created by Jeanette Mui and Erica Nguyen</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/655/6551adae45374aee8868bb20d3bc5117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EricaPikaPika"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
