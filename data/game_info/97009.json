The fate of the town being at least partially dependent on the decisions they make, like who they accept into town and how much money they collect. This sets up some difficult choices, as the circumstances of the town begin to grow dire, as well as some enjoyably silly choices, like answering \u201cWhat is my occupation here?\u201d. While the story cut\u2019s off early, presumably due to a lack of development time, Truth Be Tolled is a strong concept worth exploring.\"<br/>\u00a0<strong>- Evan Greenwood, Freelives</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/649/649241189279ccecc84e86286d240c29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bracken Hall"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
