It was developed for the Fun Jam\u00a0(10/05/2020) in 72 hours. I streamed almost all of it at\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Mavryke\u00a0&amp;\u00a0https://www.twitch.tv/mavryke\u00a0.<br/><br/>If people show interest in this proof of concept I may develop the game further. Maybe a swashbuckling campaign, ship\u00a0customization, improved varied combat, some slapping songs for each level... yeah that'd be nice.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Known issues (please notify me if you find something, even if subjective), Keep in mind that I literally did not have time to fix these.</p>\n<p>-Some players struggle with getting their bearings in 3D space</p>\n<p>-The game is too hard for some players</p>\n<p>-The kill counter acts up</p>\n<p>-Stuff hangs around for a few seconds after exploding</p>\n<p>-The game can sometimes\u00a0crash from particle effects randomly</p>\n<p>-Enemies can spawn behind the player</p>\n<p>-The camera position resets itself to preserve an \"up\" direction</p>\n<p>-The options in the options menu are fake</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:50:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f4058fa2dc610866a81e4c563c29944e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mavryke"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
