Can I do that? It's a game about Mr. Meeseeks, and in true Meeseeks fashion the game is completely pointless. It's existence is nothing but suffering, or some deep liberal arts type philosophical bullshit. Probably don't try to beat it, although it can be beat. All graphics were made in MS Paint, but I did add some effects for spice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fill the pit with an obscene amount of Meeseeks bodies to build a bridge to the other side.
