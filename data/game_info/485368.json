Auction\u00a0\r\n<p>Bid on a chicken, but don't bid too much because you'll need to pay to feed your chicken (even if you haven't placed it on your farm).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't bid too little or you might miss your chance for the chicken. If you have 3 chickens in holding (not yet placed on the farm), you won't be able to bid on that day's auction and will automatically forfeit it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a02. Build\r\n<p>Tend to your farm. Cut down forests to make way for fields. In fields, you can place buildings such as coops and feeders, as well as chickens. Make sure you don't put your chickens next to each other, or they'll lose their free-range status, and their eggs will be worth half as much. By clicking on your chickens, you can decide if that chicken will be fed today. If a chicken isn't given food, it will die, but sometimes a sacrifice must be made.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a03. End of Day\u00a0\r\n<p>Spin the wheels to see which colour chickens will lay eggs today. You can choose either result from the two wheels. Then see how you did that day by reviewing your profit and loss statements. Hopefully, you made a good profit so you can expand your farm and bid in the auction tomorrow!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T03:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d951d3ae405a965a8ad17780a80b77df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hyperfocus Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
