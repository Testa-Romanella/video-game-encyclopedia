The game was made in Unity and is for the Brackey's 2021.1 Game Jam. Feel free to ask any questions or leave constructive feedback in the comments. Thank you for playing!<br/></p>\n<br/>Gameplay:This is a local co-op game where you and a friend are little sentient jelly cubes who are\u00a0trying to escape from the facility they were created it. You will have to work together to get through the rooms and escape. You work cooperatively either together by combining \u00a0to become one large jelly cube to destroy threats and jump over large obstacles or separate to help each other progress through the rooms. When you are small you work on your own but when together you most both work together to make the same directional movements to control the large cube effectively. To separate simply travel in opposite directions from each other.\u00a0<br/><br/>Controls:<p>Player One:</p><ul><li>A \u00a0 D \u00a0 To move left and right</li><li>W \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To jump</li></ul><p>Player Two:</p><ul><li>&lt; \u00a0 &gt; \u00a0 To move left and right</li><li>^ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To jump</li></ul><p>When combined:</p><p>You must move together cooperatively to move the large cube effectively using the same controls as the individual players.\u00a0<br/></p><p>~I acquired the main song from bensound.com~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T06:38:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/175/17544254c3be0b9ae8118fea523d7dd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sShArk_B8teE3"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
