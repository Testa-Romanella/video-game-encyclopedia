{"id": 26228, "slug": "army-defender", "name": "Army Defender", "name_original": "Army Defender", "description": "<p>\n      Army Defender is an action shooter in which the player must defend his \n      base against enemy attacks by controlling a machine gun tower designed \n      to eradicate enemy waves. As the player levels up, the enemy becomes \n      more and more numerous and well-equipped. Attackers include soldiers, \n      tanks, paratroopers, helicopters, jet fighters, bombers, elite \n      commandos... Depending on the enemy type (red and green), the player \n      must switch between ammunition colors. The machine gun tower will fire \n      where the player taps the Touch Screen. Power-ups are made available on \n      a regular basis, when a super bomber delivers them onto the base. When a \n      power-up is retrieved, the player will be able to upgrade his tower \n      during a limited amount of time. Upgrades include flame-throwers, rocket \n      launchers or concussion grenades that will help contain enemy \n      progression.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6162b5962d71a0e4b75971c33650ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["MINDSCAPE"], "esrb_rating": null}
