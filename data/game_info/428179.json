Their responses are below:<br/><strong>CHRIS:</strong> Hello! I\u2019m so excited that you\u2019re considering playing our game! I'll tell you as much as I can. So we're actually not the full game. We're the demo! No one knows if the real game is out yet or not, or what genre we're really supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's just fine, I guess! Anyway, I suppose it's already been determined where you'll be going and what kinds of things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually meet you later. I've really been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!<br/><strong>HOPE:</strong> hey if u get any choices that lead u to a mochi store go there thats where the cool ppl in the game r if you dont youll probably lose ok bye<br/><strong>ASPEN:</strong> Hey YOU! Yeah, YOU! Wanna chat it up with some cute girls? (And a super cute non-binary person?) Then you've definitely found the right game! We're not like those other inferior dating simulators. We have the advantage of knowing who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well, uh...mostly. That's where you come in! You can be the one to tell us once and for all what we're really doing here! And with the help of your good buddy Aspen, we'll ensure that this game gets its best ending! Our fate rests upon your shoulders, O wise player!<br/><strong>NARI: </strong>[Declined to give a statement.]<br/><strong>ISADORA: </strong>WHAT?!??! MY QUOTE IS GOING TO BE LAST????? THAT'S NO FAIR!!! YOU SHOULD CHANGE IT SO THAT I'M, LIKE, AT LEAST SECOND? OR THIRD?!?!!? LAST IS SO STUPID!!!!!! NARI DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING AND SHE'S NOT EVEN LAST!!!!! Mine is probably gonna be HIDDEN by that STUPID READ MORE BUTTON NOW!!!!! UUUUUGGGGGGGGGGG (...wait so what exactly should I say then? ...oh, ok.) Hi! I'm Isadora, and...uh... (Oh, whatever, this is so stupid! Was that enough? Can I go now?)<h3>A NOTE FROM THE CREATOR</h3>Hello. I am the Creator. I created this Visual Novel's script, code, and music.<br/><br/>The game runs in the RenPy engine and is formatted as a visual novel. Occasionally you will choose what to say by selecting a dialogue box. There are multiple endings. It takes around two hours to complete everything.<br/><br/>It is recommended that players are at least 12 years or older. The game contains strong language and the occasional discussion of heavy topics. There is no shock imagery or jump scares.<br/><br/>The complete soundtrack is also available. It contains a little over an hour of music.<br/>Thank you to SparkBag, Keeby, and Alexander A. McDonald for creating the majority of the visual assets.<br/><br/>Please enjoy free of charge.<br/><br/>-The Creator.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T12:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae4ea99763803d2fe51c20cd2fc0bb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Not Fun Games"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Not Fun Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
