In Loot Everything, your goal is to solve puzzles and to loot all the chests that you can find in the game. There are a couple of hidden areas in the game as well.<br/>For this game, I ended up texturing nearly all of the environmental assets (Floor, walls, stairs, and so on).</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sam Gomes: 3D Modeling/Environmental Art</p><p>Lucas Remington: Production</p>\n<p>AJ Marraffa: 3D Modeling<br/></p>\n<p>Jakub Sawczuk: Programming</p>\n<p>Denzel Weatherspoon: UI Design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/684/6841625687badbff7858416fa918381c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Gomes", "LucasRemington"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
