The most formal wedding since the one of Cthulhu in the glorious past.<br/><br/>\r\n\tThe whole ocean naturally had to join the grand festivities: Whales, jellyfish, crabs, seagulls, the whole maritime world moved for the extraordinary occasion.<br/>\r\n\tBut from light came darkness, and this couple was radiant with happiness.<br/>\r\n\tThe same day as the announcement of the wedding, but in the shallow waters of <strong>Martiniquan </strong>a marital dispute exploded. A jealous octopus father gave his octopus wife an ultimatum, to choose between his dear child or the unique marriage. It goes without saying, she couldn't skip this thousand-year-old event and the father fled with the child that very day.<br/><br/>\r\n\tTorn by the cruel separation from his mother, youthful <strong>Bob</strong>, was then left in the hands of his father, an alcoholic, violent and gambling addict octopus. <strong>Bob</strong> experienced a traumatic childhood that forged him body and soul.<br/>\r\n\tBob, a few years later a mature octopus, was obsessed with only two things: <strong>Duckys'</strong> and raw shrimp. The dear couple who obsessed the marine world. Their love was worth more than an innocent child.<br/><br/>\r\n\tRiddled with hatred and revenge, <strong>Bob </strong>stopped being passive and took up arms: he raised an overwhelming army of outcasts, fellow creatures, abandoned children... To fight the couple whose happiness had unintentionally caused so much unhappiness.<br/>\r\n\tBob succeeded, he kidnapped the most coveted woman of the seven seas in a frontal attack, his nefarious plan was perfect...<br/>\r\n\tBut he omitted one thing: <strong>Ducky</strong>...\r\n\r\nCan Ducky save Roxaaaaane from the Evil Bob ?!<br/>How many innocent animals will be killed ?!? <br/> How much money is the bullets worth ?!?!? <br/> Is Ducky the bad guy ?!?!?!? <br/> Why am I doing this ?!?!?!?!? <br/><br/>\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tKey\r\n\t\t\t\tAction\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWASD<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\tMove Ducky the Immortal\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLeft Click\r\n\t\t\t\tShot baby !\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tEscape\r\n\t\t\t\tPause the game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T05:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87e/87e0da560e91a92e8b43d0c93b65405a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JaceTheBlu", "TheSaltyChild", "PtitlLu"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
