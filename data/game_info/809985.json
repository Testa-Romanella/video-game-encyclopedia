This 5-10 minute long game takes you through continual rejection in a school setting and the confusing experience of one's first panic attack, framed through the metaphor of a glitching computer. By making this game, I wanted to take charge of the experiences that I've let control me and create something meaningful for others.\u00a0When feeling alone or misunderstood, even small things can make us break. We must take care of ourselves: no just to\u00a0\"feel better,\" but to live.</p>\n<p>Message me on Instagram (@exhausted.boi) if you wanna share your thoughts on the game, learn more about Bitsy,\u00a0need help, or wanna chat!</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:\u00a0</strong>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard\u00a0to control your avatar.

Because it does not impact gameplay at all, I'm releasing the game with the bug.</p>\n<p>In dedication to and remembrance of Ms. Bazz: Feeling safe and supported\u00a0as a queer kid in one's school environment is so important.
