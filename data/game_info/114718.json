Allowing up to 4 players to face it off in this competitive wizard match.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPlayers will choose from a list of spells which they will use to burst down their opponent whilst staying inside the ever shrinking arena.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAre you a hard boiled spellslinger, do you like rainbows and candy, have you ever wanted to defeat your arch enemy while fighting in the center of the universe?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThan Bellus Mortem is for you! We have all the rainbows and candy you can ask for. With a large stock of very delectable spells for you to sling around the arena.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tRemember \"A win is not a win, unless you send a cat meme to the losers of the battle\". \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tKai is a tall and lanky guy who is consistently playing new games and developing new game ideas. This rather odd man has worked for meteorite games, SK Games and now Rhabdophobic Wizards. With very little success in his previous jobs he and kit decided to work together for one last hoorah. With over 4 years experience, Kai has developed many games that no one has heard of. He hopes with the power of kit to build games that will tear the world apart 'figuratively'.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tKit brings his experience as commercial cleaner and factory hand to the fore in his latest role as Kai's dishwashing b*#@h. He played a videogame once, many years ago, which makes him an authoritative voice in Fun Issues. Kit loves to watch communities fight over gaming related topics and hopes to build game that involves being a grave digger.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tDean is a PC elitist and believes the world should be run on 60+ FPS, he also has a large Field of View on Life and wishes to optimize the world of gaming so everyone can live in a world without connection issues and repetitive game play. He also has a hard drive to become a Legend within the Leagues of Current Legends.\r\n</p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Players change the arena during the course of a match.</li>\n<li>A vast list of spells and sets to sink your spellslinging teeth in<br/>\n</li>\n<li>Destroy your friends in the 4 v 4 all out war</li>\n<li>Each match you win, you become immediately more popular with your choices of gender.<br/>\n</li>\n<li>our game has lots of particles and feels super good - From Kit (who is kit?

In the past when we work together we managed to eradicate the issue of coordination.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMarketing is only an issue as we are lazy with it.
