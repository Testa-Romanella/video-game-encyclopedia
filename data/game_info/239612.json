Two reasons: first, Maze Manors incorporates a topology generation algorithm, thanks to which even with the same map, each game is always different and surprising. Second, after reaching the goal, you have to exit back... but it might not be as easy as you think. <br/>Maze Manors Lite provides two different game modes: in \"Find\" mode, your target is simply to find a precious gem; in \"Unlock\", first you have to look for the key, in order to find and open a chest. <br/>The two game modes and the included maps allow you to experiment with growing difficulties, that will test your quality of seekers! <br/>Bluetooth-enabled multi-playing is available (compatible with full version), with an optional turn-based mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41d/41d8fcc69f15aba2f15745559b3469bd.jpg", "website": "http://www.bonamsoft.com/taporswipe.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
