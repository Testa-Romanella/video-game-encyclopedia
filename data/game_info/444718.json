Enemies will automatically and continuously appear in waves, and must be either avoided or defeated.\u00a0Bubble attacks primarily with rapid dashes, skewering enemies with her trident. These dashes can be chained in succession, with each defeated enemy adding to a temporary multiplier, increasing her attack power and score gain. With the combination of time passing and defeating enemies, the magic gauge will fill up, and once full, Bubble can unleash a radiant screen-clearing super move, the Magic Flash!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controlling</strong><strong>\u00a0Your Destiny</strong></p>\n<p>Magical Bubble supports keyboard and gamepad controls, but <em>gamepad is highly recommended</em>. This demo does not feature a button remapping option, but the final game will.</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: D-pad or left stick (controller), WASD or arrow keys (keyboard)</li><li>Dash attack: Xbox A button (controller), Spacebar (keyboard)</li><li>Super attack: Xbox B button (controller), Left Shift (keyboard)</li><li>Pause button: Start button (controller), ESC key (keyboard)</li></ul>\n<p>Some debug keyboard shortcuts have also been purposefully left in this build, but it'll be up to you to discover what they are...!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tips and Tricks from the Pros</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Your dash goes farther the longer you hold the button, but it\u00a0does not last forever! Carefully consider your dash attacks, lest they peter out right in front of an oncoming enemy.</li><li>Though the dash will harm all oncoming enemies, it will not protect you from any projectiles they might shoot out at you. Dashing headfirst into one of these will only get you hurt!</li><li>The multiplier increases not only points gained, but damage dealt! The higher the multiplier, the fewer hits you'll need to take down tougher enemies. You\u00a0might even be able to take them down in a single blow!</li><li>Though defeating enemies using the Magic\u00a0Flash super move doesn't add to your multiplier, the multiplier does affect the points earned from enemies defeated by it. Consider taking out a few enemies\u00a0to boost the multiplier before wiping out the screen with a super!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pardon The Mess...</strong></p>\n<p>This demo represents a work in progress, and as such has a few known bugs.</p>\n<ul><li>Shark enemy sometimes spins in place when hit by the\u00a0super move; if this happens, attack it with a dash and it will fly offscreen like normal.</li><li>On rare occasions, the player may get stuck on edges of the screen. If this happens, use the \"RESTART ROOM (DEBUG)\" option in the pause menu. If you're in the main level, you will have to start the level over from the beginning, but if you're in the boss fight, you will only have to start the boss fight from the beginning.</li></ul><p>If you discover any bugs not listed here, please get in contact!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f8/0f86645f109ec7cdd53f9abfd4d0ef26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matto_bii"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
