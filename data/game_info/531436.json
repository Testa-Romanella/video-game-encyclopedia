I wish I had time to add them.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: I discovered a miscalculation in the character attack roll which is why the characters miss so many attacks. I am currently fixing it, and I may add some more content when I do. Keep checking in, if you are interested.</strong><br/></p><p>I ran out of time, so\u00a0there are loads more to do;<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Magic hasn't been implemented at all</li><li>There are only 2 weapons</li><li>There are only 3 sets of armor</li><li>There are only 2 monsters</li><li>There is really no reason to explore the catacomb. There is no end goal yet</li><li>There're a few bugs</li></ul>\n<p>I can still add these, but I needed to get this submitted.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>The game is not meant to be played in full screen.</strong></li><li><strong>To view the character in-game, press the character's corresponding number (not #). This confused me, and everyone else.</strong></li><li>There are treasure in most of the rooms, and none in the passages. Passages do have some consumables that may/may not help. Press 'S' to search the tile you are on.</li><li>When you drop items, they will remain on the tile you are standing on. Search again to pick them up again.</li><li>You can bash down a locked door, but those may set off a trap. Use a lockpick to avoid traps from triggering. You would obviously need to find a lockpick somewhere.</li><li>The inventory is atrocious. This is how it was back in the day. Feel my pain...</li><li>You can only equip weapons and armor, and only one of each type. In a perfect world, there would've also been some artifacts to buff your stats a bit.</li><li>The dungeons are procedurally generated, so they never look the same. A minimap would be nice, wouldn't it? Along with a reason to be in the dungeon.</li><li>There are 2 pregenerated characters, but you can create your own. They will be saved, but game state will not. Also, don't create more than 10 characters. I have not built a safety check, so the excess won't be saved. Or the game will break. Or something. Delete the ones you don't want.</li></ul>\n<p>Thank you Dan for the fun jam. I've always been threatening to make a RPG, and this had me going at it for many hours. Much fun. Much shoulder tension</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T06:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be3a86bf512ff4dbae98762c8f7335e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bixarrio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
