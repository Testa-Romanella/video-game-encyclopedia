This prototype was taken further in mini-production and worked on for another 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>The team included myself, Eloise Carr, Calliope Ryder (@callioperyder), Ben Walden, Jacob Copper, and Chris Hodgson.</p>\n<p>The gameplay consists of managing callouts to different types of problems the city\u2019s citizens may face. Problems are split into 4 different categories, and the player has 2 contractors in each category that they may send to jobs. Players must respond to jobs before they turn red, as citizens will get angry and the city\u2019s happiness will go down.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:48:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cb/8cb398c08d757d68cf1b92fdd1273525.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["craigduthie"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
