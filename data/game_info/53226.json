It was released in the United States in 1991 on the TurboGrafx-16 and again for the Game Boy Advance on October 15, 2002. It is the North American port of Tennis Cup, previously released in 1989 on micro-computers.</p>\n<p>In the GBA version's two game modes, the player assumes control of either a tennis player during a single match or an entire country's team in the Davis Cup, an international competition. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. The game garnered mixed reviews from critics, who overall felt that it paled in comparison to 2002's Virtua Tennis and earlier versions of Mario Tennis.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1991-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:47:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cf/7cf930f79b0ea2a653f902226abedcf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Hokus Pokus Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
