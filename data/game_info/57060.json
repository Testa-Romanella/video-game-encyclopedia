It was released in 1995 for the Super NES, Genesis, and Atari Jaguar consoles. It is a slapstick game in which the player tends to have to lean towards \"dirty\" play, and special player abilities include the ability to dive in an attempt to win a free-kick or penalty. There are two gameplay modes: tournament and exhibition. A password is given out following the successful completion of each game in the tournament so that play can be resumed at a later point.</p>\n<p>In Germany, the Super NES game was released under the title Mario Basler: Jetzt geht\u2019s Los!.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a776e07504ecc1b039a97135e44e26df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Jaguar", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["U.S. Gold"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Atari", "U.S. Gold"], "esrb_rating": null}
