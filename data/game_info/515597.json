Especially when he needs peace. From you. But you have to find him! You are his servant, after all!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the\u00a02020 October HEJ game jam. The theme of the jam was Leave Me Alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first ever \"real\" puzzle game. By \"real\" I mean it includes things game puzzles usually include: levers, mirrors and light beams and of course clues for the solution. I did not go overboard with the difficulty - in fact, I think the puzzles are rather easy. I wanted to make sure everything works and the code is not all over the place (however, it could definitely do with some refactoring). I also wanted to make it my best looking game up to date, so I used the HDRP render pipeline in Unity, as well as the most beautiful free assets I could find. I also made some assets myself.</p>\n<p>I also wanted the game to have a distinct, eerie atmosphere. I added the 'horror' tag, and although it may give you a startle, I tried to avoid any jumpscares.</p>\n<p>Things I learned during this project:</p>\n<ul><li>creating basic puzzle logic</li><li>animation</li><li>modeling in Blender</li><li>Shader Graph</li><li>VFX Graph</li><li>Ragdoll (no animation yet, just setting it up)</li></ul>\n<p>Sources I used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity Asset Store</li><li>Freesound.org</li></ul>\n<p>Programs used:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Audacity</li><li>Blender</li><li>Gimp</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:20:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26ce9c945ee39478f959ebb279e75c3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bence Mervay"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
