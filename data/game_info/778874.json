Occasionally, I stream on twitch.tv. Sometimes when I do this I make a micro visual novel\u00a0using the words from a Codenames board, Ren'py for the writing, and Aseprite to make the images. This is a collection of the first five of these micro-visual novels that I made this way. They're weird, random, and sometimes nonsensical, and the art style is...interesting to say the least. But hey, I hope there's some enjoyment to be had in them. And it's free, so at worst you wasted a whole $0.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T09:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/575/575c093280ea896c3d2c47c4e1a7fe35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ownee171"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
