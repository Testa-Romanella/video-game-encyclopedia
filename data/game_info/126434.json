I have to give a special thanks to my younger brother, who IS way more well versed with making games than I am. Without his help, I probably would've spent most of my time coding menus (the extent of my knowledge at the beginning).</p><p>I've come to learn a ton with this project, way more than I had anticipated, and I can't wait to see what more I can learn with it. Perhaps an updated future release? </p><p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy, and I look forward to continuing to make games for all!</p><p>-\"Boho\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/2759e0f5b757453e1fc0a520e8be492a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Royal Den Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
