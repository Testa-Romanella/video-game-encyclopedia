Their companion is the \u2018Operator\u2019, a hacker-archetype who provides support remotely from terminal interfaces inside the relative safety of an orbital pod. The Operator must monitor their teammate\u2019s vitals, remotely control aspects of the environment and hack into the station's data archives to uncover hidden information.<br/></p>\n<p>The Explorer must become the Operator\u2019s eyes and hands, as they traverse ever deeper into the derelict station. By combining their knowledge and abilities, the two players solve environmental puzzles, overcome deadly hazards and uncover a timeline of events leading up to the crew\u2019s mysterious disappearance.<br/><br/>Using two networked computers, both players\u2019 games are deeply entwined and co-dependant - making communication the cornerstone of the experience.</p>\n<p>WEBSITE</p>\n<p>TWITTER</p>\n<p>FACEBOOK</p>\n<p>FULL PLAYTHROUGH</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Anastasi</strong>\r\nGameplay and System Engineer</p>\n<p><strong>Shaun Bright</strong>\r\nLead Level Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Monica Flores</strong>\r\nQA Lead</p>\n<p><strong>Matthew Harvey</strong>\r\nLead Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Lloyd Iddles</strong>\r\nNetwork and Gameplay Engineer</p>\n<p><strong>Jessica May</strong>\r\nArt Director / 3D Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Josh Morris</strong>\r\nCharacter and Environment Artist / Animator</p>\n<p><strong>Nathaniel Preller</strong>\r\nTechnical Artist / Sound Director</p>\n<p><strong>Felix Strangio</strong>\r\nProducer / Creative Director</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:23:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/527/5271754556b1175dbf38cfae11cfce22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Disaster Fish"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
