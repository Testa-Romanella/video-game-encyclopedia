I decided to create my own little game (well... now it's no more little tho) - Working on Traveler since some years now.<br/>It is inspired by the game \"Uru\" - an old game about traveling to different worlds, solving puzzles to go on.<br/>And since I'm a really big fan of RPG's, I thought I could combine the fighting-stuff with the puzzle-stuff and well.... That happened. \ud83d\ude42<h3>What is the game about?</h3><ul><li> Traveler contains right now 8 (*1) different themed worlds you are able to explore by your own<br/></li><li> Traveler is an open world game with the focus on exploring and solving quests<br/></li><li> Traveler is an rpg game<br/></li><li> Key elements of traveler are magic, quests, world bosses and exploration goals</li></ul><br/>*1: Please refer to the early access section to see our plans", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T04:58:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f9/7f9af6324bef92b84956772e78d57188.jpg", "website": "https://traveler.karinspring.ch", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Gameplay First Studios", "SuuYasha", "Lulalaby"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Gameplay First Studios", "AITSYS"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
