Use powerful weapons to fend off the advancing waves of bugs. Find the strategy that works for you and utilize multiple tower types to create an impenetrable defense network.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever made. I set aside 2 weeks to try and make something I could be proud of, and here is the result! All animations, pixel art and programming is my work. Please give me any feedback you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you decide to play the game, tell me how long you played it for! My goal was to keep a player engaged for at least 5 minutes, and leave them with something they can remember fondly, and launch every now and again\u00a0to kill some time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:54:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41a71b3840509beb42ee04cf570123ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Masterpoda"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
