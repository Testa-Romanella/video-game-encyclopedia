Collisions, minimap are not implemented and sprites and assets are placeholders. </p><p>What you are about to play in this demo will be the first map in the full game campaign when it's hopefully done. </p><p>I am currently working on this title alone, and I'm in need of an artist. If you are interested, you can mail me your works at thenewnecromancy@gmail.com. </p><p>Thanks for reading, downloading the demo and bother playing it, hope you enjoy. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72d/72d8df366ec6d7a5e97720a95909a933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Coldest"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
