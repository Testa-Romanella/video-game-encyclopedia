I apologize in advance in case that should happen.<br/>Trying to purposely break the game might lead to success in doing so.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Game art and sfx: PunkPebbleStudio<br/>Character art: Xanderwood<br/>Music: @jackmorons from Studio67<br/>Font used: DPComic<br/>Intro ambient: freesound.org</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ojas Chordiya for participating to the project as a subscriber of the channel by drawing some of the props under the ice!\u00a0</p>\r\nThank you for playing, I hope you enjoy the experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T07:47:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a9/5a9a18d40652785d45a8a7e0c517eff3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["whateep"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
