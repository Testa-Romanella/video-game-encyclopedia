This turbulent time marks the disintegration of the longest lived of all imperial dynasties, the Zhou. Out of the strife and chaos emerges a nobleman possessed of an indomitable spirit and an uncompromising vision of the future: Ying Zheng, ruler of the Qin state. He will stop at nothing to reunite the disparate Chinese kingdoms. Combining ancient legends and mythic storytelling with historical fact, Seal of Evil sets the stage for an epic adventure wherein the players struggle to thwart the Qin invasion of their peaceful homeland, East Baiyue. Ferocious beasts, merciless enemy soldiers, wicked bandits, and terrifying supernatural foes are hazards they must face in order to achieve this goal. There is still hope for them, however, for along the way they will also make many friends and acquire powerful weapons and equipment. And armed with mighty elemental magic, they may yet come face to face with the very Gods themselves.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T04:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c810d230e21ce9916e982f08aed43e08.jpg", "website": "http://eng.objectgames.com/soe/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 22, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 557, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Object Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Strategy First", "GMX Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
