The fabled Purple Turtles rise and fall as the whim takes them and due to their passive nature and unusual buoyancy they can be used as stepping stones. A game for the young at heart and for people who have tired of alien bashing.</p>\n<p><strong><em>How to play</em></strong></p>\n<p>Jack is standing on the left hand bank of the river at the start of the annual Turtle Bobbing contest. On the right hand bank is a fruit tree and Jack must cross the river using the turtles as stepping stones to collect the fruit and bring it back to the left hand bank. But don't let Jack fall into the water\u00a0 or he will drown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also available for download in .CIA format for the Nintendo 3DS virtual console!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game</strong><strong>: </strong>Start<br/>\n<strong>LEFT / RIGHT:</strong>\u00a0Cursor keys<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Start the game: </strong>Enter<br/><strong>LEFT / RIGHT:\u00a0</strong>Arrow keys</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Plus 4 World</p>\n<p>\r\nWLS Homepage\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T13:28:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7d310dcda4f0fc181a21708d640725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rajcs\u00e1nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
