Your objective: Get More Rainbows!</p><p>\"Developed\" over the course of one 28-hour stretch of coffee, more coffee and in the end too much coffee, what was at first merely a movement test meant to refresh old rusty skills turned into a spur-of-the-moment stress relief by way of rerouting that stress into aortic miscarriages of retina-erasing colours and earpiercing earworms.</p><p>Featuring an ever-increasing dynamic difficulty, the game may start easy but eventually you will struggle to keep up with the beat.</p><p>Being in alpha, or more readily, being a proof of concept or experiment, it is in its current state somewhat janky and lacking a certain sense of polish. The game has also not been tested on platforms other than Windows machines, XP and up. Also, seizure warning. With those caveats out of the way, I hope you enjoy More Rainbows, if only for 5 minutes. And hey, you can always make more levels - source files included!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/699/69905076aa811bc8690d042d342d9d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silas Grarup"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
