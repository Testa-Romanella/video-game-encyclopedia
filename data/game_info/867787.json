You can ignite your Torch at the Fire, it will continue burning until the Torch health runs down to 0. You can relight a dead torch at the Fire just like before. A lit Fire Torch will also set Enemies on fire and immediately make them run away from combat. Torches can also be stored on the Weapons Wall - this will extinguish the torch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0'<strong>Chop-Chop</strong>' - You'll now find Wood Logs around the forest.
