There are a few ways to carry out this objective.\u00a0First, you can buy real and fool's gold directly, with\u00a0no luck or chance involved- an option for quick, safe profits. However, you can also buy mystery gold, which could be real or fake. Real and fool's gold are equally common, but the real gold is much more valuable.\u00a0\u00a0As you wait to buy, mystery gold's price raises, but you can always discard the gold to reduce the price and test a new piece of gold.\u00a0Buying mystery gold adds to your MPS-Money Generated Per Second, giving you steady income.\u00a0\u00a0Mystery gold can be tested using your tester, which starts with just 50% accuracy. As the game goes on, you can upgrade your tester's accuracy to a near-perfect 99% accuracy.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left click for most actions(Buy, Sell, Select Tester)</p>\n<p>Right Click to deselect Tester</p>\n<p>Hover over gold with the tester selected to test</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T21:07:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bb91106ad5e970288ffa9d766398361.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lzimm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
