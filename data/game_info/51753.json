Enemy ships warp in above your cities trying to take down the city shields and kill your population. You direct the power of the awesome weapons platform by aiming anti-ballistic missiles at the enemy\u2019s missiles and ships with your hands. Using the platform\u2019s store you can extend your cities\u2019 defenses by building floating shields, anti-ballistic missile batteries and even automated anti-air plasma cannons.  The more enemy you take out, the greater the bankroll for further purchases.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMoving about the city scape as a 170-story tall, invisible spectre in the center of the onslaught, you understand what the city is facing. You are its guardian.  Will you repel the invasion triumphantly or wail at the deaths brought by your failure?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab51d75a8fbc03f025b2610e16c8297f.jpg", "website": "http://www.bansheeforce.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sapphire Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sapphire Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
