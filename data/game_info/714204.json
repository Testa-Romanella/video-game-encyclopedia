I try a lot during the time of\u00a0designing and programming this game. I admit what I think is too big to complete all in a short time by myself, and I try my best to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 This game is a 2D platform adventure\u00a0game. Its story is mainly about a\u00a0graduation the Brave Major student's challenge to pass the\u00a0\u00a0city with\u00a0\u00a0harsh environment and changeable enemies.<br/><br/>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 I use these in my program: UniversalRenderPipeline, Tilemap,\u00a0\u00a0and Cinemachine. I have never the Cinemachine before, and this problem also improves me that how to use them to get a better game effect.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I designed the appearance and skills of the enemies and the player character. Due to the limitations of my personal abilities, they could not do very complicated movements.</p>\n<p>This game does not have very complicated operations, and it is easy to pass the level for players who are not good at playing platform action games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real machine demonstration\uff1a</p>\n\n\n<p>The Source File DL link:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DuD5idnfqA25PugsLHQoSNXM-cuyeBoH/view?usp=shari...</p>\n<p>PC DL link:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRuvWbi_63TXiw7nkF8EaKxqgusqatVU/view?usp=shari...\u00a0</p><p>My email address is samuraifingers@outlook.com, welcome to any comments^^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd22f02583a575affaec166b88e67775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lemonynn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
