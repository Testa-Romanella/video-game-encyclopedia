First, we wanted to tell a story that sticks even after completing the game. That\u2019s why the narrative is built around the subject of escapism thus drawing a natural parallel between players and the scholars motivation. Secondly, exploring the world has to feel effortless and convey a sense of joy through free, low-gravity movement. Last but no least: once the curtains close, players should be left behind in a state of inner calm and reflectiveness.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T06:48:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75c/75c025143fa374542100d2734b3a2ddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games Academy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
