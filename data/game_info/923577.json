Of course, she doesn't get to do either of those things in this prototype!<br/><br/>FLAWS AND OTHER ISSUES:<br/>- A bunch of character images display as broken files for some reason.<br/>- There are a few places where text is misaligned.<br/>- One of the menus hasn't been re-skinned from TyranoBuilder's default.<br/>- The game softlocks right as it's about to introduce the central mechanic. Why? I never built it. TyranoBuilder is ill-suited for my ends, it seems, and I will not learn how to program.<br/><br/>STUFF THAT'S\u00a0GOOD:<br/>- Has nice music<br/>- Lots of clicking<br/><br/>I have tried to undertake this project 3 separate times and sunk 60-100 hours into the endeavor each time before giving up, waiting a year, and starting over again from scratch.
