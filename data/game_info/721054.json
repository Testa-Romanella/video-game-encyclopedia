{"id": 721054, "slug": "flood-2022", "name": "Flood (2022)", "name_original": "Flood (2022)", "description": "You are given a grid of squares, coloured at random in multiple colours. In each move, you can flood-fill the top left square in a colour of your choice (i.e. every square reachable from the starting square by an orthogonally connected path of squares all the same colour will be filled in the new colour). As you do this, more and more of the grid becomes connected to the starting square.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour aim is to make the whole grid the same colour, in as few moves as possible. The game will set a limit on the number of moves, based on running its own internal solver. You win if you can make the whole grid the same colour in that many moves or fewer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have any suggestions to make the game better, you can tell me in the steam community.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T03:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4ad636083ca46caa51136918482cdd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zkolibre Studio"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zkolibre Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
