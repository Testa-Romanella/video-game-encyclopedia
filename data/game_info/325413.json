{"id": 325413, "slug": "carsons-loop", "name": "Carson's Loop", "name_original": "Carson's Loop", "description": "<p>Carson's Loop is a short narrative game, where you the player will guide Jared Carson after he wakes up through a high-tech location that seems abandoned. Discover why he's there, uncover what kind of people worked here and what they were doing, and prepare to make a very difficult decision.</p>\n<p>This game was originally in a \"complete\" state in summer 2018, however I held off on releasing it as I knew there was more I could do to refine it. After another year of my Games Design university course (my final year!), I've been able to give Carson's Loop much more polish and improve the experience much more than I would have been able to in 2018.</p>\n<p>If you have any comments, suggestions on how to improve it, if you've found any problems, or just want to rant about its god/bad points, then please go ahead! Everything can help me improve!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T13:07:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/5007d93bd6f7e548f9731f7db5e2d802.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidBlack"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
