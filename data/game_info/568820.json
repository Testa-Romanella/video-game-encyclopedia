And the first I made a repository for on Github. It's been a momentous but tough week for me and my concept.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I just want to talk about what's missing from the game. Most importantly, I wasn't able to work in the jam theme of \"strength in differences\" because of the time it took me to develop the basic game mechanics. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out the best way of dynamically getting a crate, collecting candy, and putting it on a conveyor. This took up WAY more time than I imagined when I started. Because of that, I had to cut the second candy container which would have been a smaller basket-type item with the ability to make the candy pipes spit out rare items like a magical mushroom. Another casualty of my time management was a vacuum robot enemy that would randomly spawn and take away your points if you didn't dodge it.</p>\n<p>Secondly, despite the gaping holes in the project, I learned quite a bit about both Unity's physics (or rather, how to tame Unity's physics) and exporting textures from Blender to Unity. Some parts of the room texture are messed up but are now patched up post-submission period. I fully expect my next jam to have even more complicated UVs and textures with all that I've learned. \u00a0I'm also grateful for just how much this has reinforced my C# skills, as almost every part of the scripting was done by memory or MS documentation alone. IEnumerators are my friend and I will die for them, but I'd love to use interfaces in the next jam.</p>\n<p>Third, the bugs! So many bugs. The most egregious of them would have to be the conveyor bug, where the colliders have a bit of an accident and stop talking to each other when a crate hits a conveyor, ultimately preventing you from scoring with that crate. Speaking of crates, isn't it fun how pushing one crate into another will most likely destroy it? That's a bad Blender habit if I ever did see one... don't take shortcuts like me, join your meshes and make box colliders by hand if you have concave objects like a bucket! Good times.</p>\n<p>This game was programmed, modeled, and textured by me (Terrell aka meshdrip), along with amazing music from my girlfriend Topaz (https://soundcloud.com/lvndr-hze). Please give her some support if you dig the tunes.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think I'll be more likely to join a team next time around. Even though I can rough it just enough, having to not only write the code but also put out the endless fires with hours of bug squashing wasn't fun. The best part of all this was making everything in Blender because things just work there! Seriously though, I'm glad I participated and am proud of what little game there is. Looking through everyone's submissions is also a blast and getting me excited to do another jam soon. You all did a phenomenal job this week!</p>\n<p>Things I used:<br/>Blender (modeling, texturing)</p>\n<p>Ultimate Sound FX Bundle by Sidearm Studios (random SFX)</p>\n<p>DOTween by Demigiant (For those sick UI tweens)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:36:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/72545d05ce1f3225e9d4c3691c6fc06f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\ud83e\uddca\ud83d\udca7meshDrip\ud83d\udca7\ud83e\uddca"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
