{"id": 18143, "slug": "zen-bound-2", "name": "Zen Bound 2", "name_original": "Zen Bound 2", "description": "<p>Zen Bound 2 is an indie puzzle game developed by Secret Exit. It is a spiritual successor to the first Zen Bound.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features no plot whatsoever and focuses on the relaxing aspect of itself. The main objective of the game is to paint wooden sculptures using a rope to wrap them up. As the rope touches the sides of the object you are tying it around, they get painted. The players have to completely cover the sculpture with paint using as less rope as possible. There are three completion goals present in the game - minimum, medium, and max paint coverage. The players have to be careful, as the rope is not infinite and the players can run out of it if they use it irresponsibly.</p>\n<p>Most of the game&#39;s sculptures resemble animals, birds, geometrical structures, or building components.</p>\n<p>The developers call Zen Bound 2 a down-tempo experience, which puts a heavy emphasis on the ability for its players to calm down and focus only on the task that is rather challenging, yet is not stress-inducing.</p>\n<p>For those who still want some challenge, the game offers a Challenge mode. Time limits are featured in this mode, which sometimes make your heart beat much faster. Challenging achievements are also present in the game, with most of them hidden to encourage at least some degree of exploration in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-25T05:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd9/dd909004052791fbc9dedb307bd6f10d.jpg", "website": "http://www.zenbound.com", "rating": 3.34, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 878, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 37}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 79, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 79, "platforms": ["Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "PC", "iOS", "macOS"], "developers": ["Secret Exit"], "genres": ["Casual", "Family", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Secret Exit"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
