The heroes comprising the enemy party, the environment they must travel through, and even the events that occur along the way will be randomly chosen from a huge pool of possibilities. You can build out your character's ability set to your liking and handle the scenarios you're confronted with however you deem fit. But choose carefully, as the decisions you make along the way might just help you later on... or come back to haunt you.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>End of The Party is expected to release in December of 2020. The best way to stay up to date on our project is to join our Discord server (see <em>Social Medias</em>).</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thanks, and enjoy the demo!</strong></p>\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 How to play (Battle Phase):\r\n<p><strong>All abilities\u00a0can be found in the right pull-out tab.
