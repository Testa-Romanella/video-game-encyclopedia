But <strong>PLEASE let me know what do you think about the game, specially if this game is aimed for you.</strong> <strong>If people liked it.

This way, you can not only enjoy the game on a whole other level, but also experience (at some small leve) the difficulties\u00a0that people with disabilities face. Maybe this will help you keep people with disabilities when developing your own game or app.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Let's make the world a better place for everyone!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/799043259974b56ed995bb3686a04bca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Gustavo H M Silva"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
