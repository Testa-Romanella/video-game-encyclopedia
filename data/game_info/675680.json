They could find common cause in the fight against England, but could not reach a compromise to join together in a common union.</p>\n<p>In 1788, George Washington I was crowned the first\u00a0king of Virginia. The other colonies soon crowned their own kings.\u00a0Today, these lands host 50 staunchly independent nation states in an unstable state of short term alliances and border conflicts.</p>\n<p>That was more than a century ago. The recent situation here\u00a0in Europe\u00a0is tense, and war between the great European powers may be inevitable. The unstable situation situation in the Americas might be just what we need.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pack your bags - you're headed to the new world.\u00a0Your mission is to collect as many allies in the new world as possible before a potentially catastrophic war in Europe begins. We will likely need to call on them in the dark days ahead.</p>\n\n<p>50 Crowns for 50 Kings is a turn-based grand strategy game, where you control the agents of a major European power in an alternative 1911. Send out your diplomats and spies to the kings of the Americas. Ally with the kings and use your influence to help your allies and weaken those who ally with other European powers.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay is inspired by the mechanics of board games. The player\u00a0with the highest score at the end of 13 turns wins. Each player's score is the total score of all of their American allies, which are based on that kingdoms\u00a0economy and military.</p>\n<p>Each turn, players take turns distributing their spies and diplomats across America. Diplomats strengthen your relationship with a king, and spies allow for tricky plays and subterfuge. Then each player may play cards from their hand. What cards you can play and which actions you can take depend on where you placed your diplomats and spies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/739/73921de7a4f95262da4a77ff2ebb57c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mercurywave"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
