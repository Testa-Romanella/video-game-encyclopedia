Step by step, level by level, Chernobyl after Fukushima. You will turn into a real engineer, able to cope with any critical situation - the emission of radiation, fire, earthquake. Grab the Geiger counter and go!<br/><br/>The system of the nuclear power plant is very interesting and happy - you will have to monitor the temperature of the nuclear reactor, the turbogenerator, the pressure, the level of radiation.<br/><br/>The game contains detailed training! You will understand how the nuclear reaction is taking place and how the energy of nuclear fuel goes into electricity.<br/><br/>The game contains 12 levels (yet). At the first levels, you will learn to control the nuclear power plant.<br/><br/>Gradually, you will discover new improvements:<br/>Protection from radiation,<br/>Improvements in the reactor and other components,<br/>Overload of nuclear fuel,<br/>Systems of extinguishing fires, cooling the reactor and other things!<br/><br/>Such a multitude of systems will help you avoid a nuclear (thermal) explosion!<br/><br/>The latest levels - Fukushima and Chernobyl - will help you become acquainted with the causes of these nuclear accidents (but in a very simplified form).<br/><br/>For example, one of the critical errors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant was the placement of emergency generators in rooms below sea level. Tsunami flooded the generators and the nuclear power plant was left without electricity.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- A realistic nuclear reactor control system<br/>- Training<br/>- Plot<br/>- Levels of Chernobyl and Fukushima<br/>- A variety of Nuclear power plant parameters: from pressure to radiation level<br/>- 4 languages<br/><br/>Good game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T03:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589e1fbe95b980ab418088fdd4309832.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Dmitry Lomakin"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": ["Dmitry Lomakin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
