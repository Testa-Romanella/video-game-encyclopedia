You have to go inside your mind, find the truths, and avoid the lies. Your mind is a dark place, but you\u00a0can use your psyche to brighten it up a bit and defeat lies, but we careful: Using too much psyche will drive you insane.<br/><br/>Controls: WASD or Arrow Keys to move and click to use your light\u00a0(The light will follow the cursor). Collect as many Truths (white sparkly orb things) as you can.</p>\n<p>I took the theme of the Jam pretty literally. The game is a liar, who actually hides the truth, which you need to go find. It's a bit of a stretch, but whatever.\u00a0This is also my first published game.</p>\n<p>I'm also working on another project with friends call Voidbound. Find out out by looking up Double Edge Studios on social media.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T09:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ba/0ba44423a7793fa1ac2ffc322a0f0c67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sauce_Man50"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
