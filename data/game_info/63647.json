Every week a single track is added to the radio in the rotation. What will be a hit in February? And in October?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA realistic courier simulator - every day is similar to the previous one. Routine. Only addresses and cargo for delivery differ. Everything, as in life.<br/>\r\nMinimalistic text interface. Get a check-list with assignments for each day and execute them for income.<br/>\r\nA random list of cases for each game day - a lot of combinations of subject-address, there will be almost no repetitions.<br/>\r\nMusic written by a neural network is a unique soundtrack for every game week. But you can choose manually in the settings you like the melody, and it will not interrupt during the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:19:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cc/0cccbac892a74842e546622541a5bca6.jpg", "website": "http://www.azimut-games.ru/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 72, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["azimut team"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["azimut team"], "esrb_rating": null}
