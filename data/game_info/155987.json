Although there are no enemies or obstacles there's still a score, a reason to run, and some things that can hurt you.</p>\n<p>The game auto-runs, jump with X.<br/>Launch a useless (no enemies) disc with Z for cool sound effects!</p>\n<p>I mostly used this for practice with infinite backgrounds and spawn different objects with variables in order to get a little bit of practice in generating random, procedural, or prefab maps. I also used it to practice on having multiple screens available to players (title, info, and game) and rearranging my interface to be more user friendly.</p>\n<p>In the future I may add more to this with monsters or additional platforms, but for now it was a good practice run!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15b/15b834980f5670d81ca7affdd754d911.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["4KbShort"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
