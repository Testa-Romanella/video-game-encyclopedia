Made with some autumnal, northeastern love.

They say she\u2019s the watchdog of this town despite the fact no one knows what she looks like, or lived to tell the tale. They say she could kill someone just as easily as she could disappear them.\u00a0</p><p><em>An anonymous social media application buzzes in your pocket.\u00a0</em></p><p><em>A girl goes missing after a Halloween party.\u00a0</em></p><p><em>Eyes watch you from the shadows.\u00a0</em></p><p><em>A fresh cigarette butt in the spotlight of a street lamp.</em></p><p>*This Small Town is designed with a built-in MC-NPC, a Cerberus named Cleo. Feel free to use her as you please or\u00a0use her as a scare tactic.\u00a0</p>WAYWARD COVE<p>Small fishing colonial town in the Northeast, US. Population &lt;1000.</p><p>It\u2019s too quiet and cramped around here. It smells like fish and sewage water in the snow. One wrong move and some old lady you grew up with tells your parents that \u201cshe\u2019s worried about you\u201d. It\u2019s suffocating, but you can\u2019t leave. Something happened to you when you were a child, and for as long as you can remember, you\u2019ve been harboring a hellish secret to yourself or with your family and friends. Your people have grown to depend on you somehow because of this.\u00a0</p><p>For now, you keep your head down. Just try to exist or brainstorm how to get out until you can. All you need to remember... is that the people of this town know more and do more than they let on.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T09:39:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23e/23e9194bad708a9519c793a43395fa49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josephine Kim"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
