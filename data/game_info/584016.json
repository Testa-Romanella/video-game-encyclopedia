Her name was Penny Black,\u00a0a girl slightly shorter than most girls her age, with short black hair\u00a0and bright blue eyes.</p>\n<p>To your surprise, she accepted your proposal! The meeting point was just\u00a0outside the Soma Cinema Complex, Saturday at eleven o\u2019clock. This is where\u00a0your little adventure\u2026 or misadventure begins\u2026</p>\n<p>////////////////////////</p>\n<p><strong>Playing the game</strong></p>\n<p>Since Penny Black is a text only dating simulator, you will need to read\u00a0the story in order to get an understanding of your location. More often\u00a0than not, you will be told to press the Enter key in order to advance\u00a0the story. There are times, however, where you have to make a choice, which\u00a0is done by typing in a certain word and pressing Enter. If the word is\u00a0erased, that means the word is either spelled incorrectly or it is invalid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you made a good choice then your score will increase; the higher thescore, the better of an ending you will receive. Bad choices will give youfewer points, terrible choices will reduce your score... and the worst ofthe worst choices will give you BAD endings.</p>\n<p>Also when you are presented with a choice, typing in ENDGAME will reset your\u00a0progress and return you to the title screen (your score will become zero).</p>\n<p>To quit the game, simply type in '2' on the title screen, and then confirmthis by typing Y or YES (you can of course close the window as well).</p>\n<p>Look out for asterisks (*) that appear next to the title of the scene.\u00a0\u00a0If you see one then that means there are 1-4 hidden choices in addition\u00a0\u00a0to the ones presented to you.</p>\n<p>Although there is no save or load feature, it is relatively short to\u00a0complete; approximately 40 minutes to one hour for a single play-through,\u00a0depending on your speed at reading.</p>\n<p>////////////////////////</p>\n<p><strong>In closing...</strong></p>\n<p>I created Penny Black using BBC Basic for Windows. My coding skills are\u00a0extremely limited, and I only hope to compensate this with my moderate\u00a0talent for writing. In spite of this, I hope you enjoy playing the game.</p>\n<p>- Bobby Zeal\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:00:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbe/dbe0c8d07ef54df5b17d16f78fb341a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Zeal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
