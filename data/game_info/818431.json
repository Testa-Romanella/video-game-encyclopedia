Since I pushed my game out just barely making it in time, I just wanted to give anyone that is wishing to try this game a quick run through if needed (it should be self explanatory, but if need any help come back over to this post)<br/><br/> I'll <em>make a list below </em>of <em>anything you need to know</em> to get going after you install<em>!</em><br/><br/></strong><em><br/>Getting Started:</em><strong><br/>After running the Dev Coffee - GMTK 2022 Jam.exe you need to select:<br/><em>\"Click here to start\"</em>\u00a0 with your<em> mouse on the title screen</em>. </strong><em>Choosing / Typing in a Task to focus on:<strong><br/>You will then need to click and type in what your current task you want to complete for example you could type:<br/>\"Programming\", \"Troubleshooting\", \"Game Jamming\" (I think that's a term.. right?), \"Debugging (You know damn sure that's what I'll be doing lol, go down and look at my list of known issues below.. yikes.. I don't want to imagine the list of unknown issues looks like).<br/><br/><br/></strong>Choosing a time range for your task session<strong> </strong>(it's random, but there's a short and longer option)<strong><br/>Anyways! After you type what you'll be doing, click one of the task duration options:<br/> [Shorter Task] </strong>- Timer ranges from </em><strong><em>7-27 mins</em></strong>.<strong><br/> [Longer Task ]</strong> - Timer ranges from <strong><em>30 mins to 57 mins</em></strong> (No tasks longer than an hour)<strong><br/>[Super Short Game Jam Mode] </strong><em>- </em>Timer rangers from <strong><em>17 seconds to 2:37 seconds </em></strong><strong><em>(Game Jam Timer is currently not working, I will try and fix after voting is finished per the jam rules.) </em></strong><br/><br/><em>Start working on your task</em><strong><br/>Once you have selected your task duration options we discussed above, <em>you can can then select the \"Start Task\" button below the timer on the right side of the screen.\u00a0 </em>(note this menu with the timer currently doesn't display your initial task you typed in from the previous options / menu.)<br/></strong><strong><em><br/>After you click the \"Start Task\" button</em>, you will see one of the <em>Challenges Modifiers </em><em>you can then read in the top left of the screen</em> and try to <em>complete the challenge by beating the timer, </em>using the<em> entire time to focus on your task</em>, ect. The<em> main goal is to keep focus</em> on your main task <em>until your task is finished</em> or <em>the timer runs out.<br/></em></strong><em><br/>Finishing up. Beans and Rewards</em><strong><br/><em>When you complete</em> the task, you <em>will be rewarded with beans</em> that would be used to unlock perks or <em>\"Helper Modifiers\"</em>, the bean collecting isn't currently not working unfortunately. But while you're on the game, <em>you can click through the different challenges / helper modifiers</em> (even <em>without beans </em>currently). This can give anyone interested a general idea </strong><strong>of how this game  is supposed to help, <em>its far from an exhaustive list (Maybe like 10 modifiers total I think)</em> but definitely some things to look out for! <br/><br/><br/><em>Please. seriously </em>please<em> don't </em>wait out the timer on any of these tasks,<em> there's so many amazing jam games to play,</em> and <em>this is not one of them</em>. I just made this game with the attempt that it can hopefully trick my brain into being productive. <br/><br/> Lastly I wanted to say if you\u00a0 made it through this far along the wall of text, I just wanted to say thank you for checking this out and clicking around on through the game. There's over<em> 6000+ submissions</em> in the jam, So it really means the world to me.<br/><br/>I love the GMTK community! This was my first 48 hour jam, and it was short and sweet, I loved the theme and I'm looking forward to playing as many of these games as I can! <br/><br/></strong><strong>Cheers! We did it! <br/><br/>-Brett<br/><br/>PS. About 8 cups of iced coffee were consumed during this game jam for any curious! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Dev Coffee!</strong><br/><em>Can you smell that?</em> Smells like a fresh pot of (Game)Dev Coffee, why don't you grab a mug and hang out a while, but don't get too comfy you might not be sitting for long!<br/>Dev Coffee is an interesting take to gamify your game development tasks while giving relaxing music and sound effects to give the vibes being in a low key coffee shop all while making a dent on your project.<br/><br/><strong>Simply input your current task you're working on like: \"Programming\", \"Level Design\", \"Art\", \"Animations\", ect.<br/><br/>Then when you're ready start a randomized challenge with a randomized amount of time and try to make as much progress as you can! </strong><br/>Enjoyed what you were doing? No worries! Keep it going by starting another task and see what special challenge lies in store for you!<br/><br/>For every challenge completed you'll be rewarded with a coffee bean! Which can be spent on help modifiers to your task at hand! <br/><br/>Keep a high score of the total amount of tasks you completed as a reminder of how much progress you've made! <br/><br/><strong>Inspiration / Personal Note:</strong><br/><br/>Feel free to skip this, this is just the driving passion behind this project if anyone was\u00a0 curious why I would make a productivity focused \"game\" and how it relates to me. <br/><br/>Being able to focus and stay on task with my dev projects is always a viscous cycle of get excited about a project, work hard on it, burn out, and get excited about a new project, I'm sure this is in part due to my adult ADHD (If you <em>really </em>want a glimpse of what life is like with ADHD,<strong> </strong><strong>look no further than my hyper focused game description you're currently reading (when\u00a0 maybe I should be <em>bug fixing </em>/ <em>playing other jam games</em></strong><strong>), or look at my GMTK jam <em>submission time</em></strong><em> </em>for this game,<strong> 6 mins before I was permanently cut off.\u00a0 <br/><br/>Disclaimer:\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, take my personal experience with a grain of salt, also there's many more deficits related to ADHD, but these are the 2 issues is what I wanted to tackle in my game specifically.<br/><br/>To save you a bunch of time about all this stuff is simply put </strong>one of the many things ADHD makes you become is <em><strong>Time Blind </strong></em>meaning you just don't have \u00a0a great perception of how long things take. (It's also why I missed my submission due date on my last game jam, hooray!) <br/><br/> One of the other major problems with ADHD (<em>last one I'll bring up I swear</em>) <strong>is the </strong><strong>inability to provide a consistent stream of motivatio</strong>n <em>(i.e., consistently working on a video game for months / years.)</em>\u00a0 However things like <strong>stressful deadlines</strong>, <strong>novelty in tasks</strong>, being<strong> passionate and natural about the topic</strong> at hand, activities / tasks with <strong>quick input / response loops (i.e playing videogames)</strong>, ect., But without these kinds of motivators (or multiple of them at going on at once), makes it VERY difficult to stay on task. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Anyways, the reason why I went into everything above is to explain why\u00a0<strong>I have been dreaming</strong> for someone <strong>to somehow make being productive as addictive as playing videos games are</strong>, but that's so\u00a0 hard to find and harder to execute (I feel doing gamedev on it's own right is the closest to that feeling <strong>because depending on the task, it IS better than playing games</strong>). This game certainly<strong><em> is not</em></strong> that, but it's my first time trying to blend productivity and gaming. The goal is to add some randomness to assist with the motivation and get an idea on how long tasks are taking (time blindness issues) that come up every so often, on this very long and daunting (but extremely rewarding) gamedev journey. Especially for the days I'm just not as motivated and want to trying doing the same repetitive tasks in a new light!\u00a0 I mainly made this game for me to see if something like this could work for me, but better yet if it could help someone out similar that's in my shoes, even just a little bit, then it was totally worth it. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Q/A:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Why put silly limitations on the usual way to work through game development?</strong><br/>This definitely isn't a method for everyone I completely understand that. I've heard and read from multiple sources that limiting ourselves can bring a whole new perspective on our creative process, And interestingly enough it can actually feel more liberating when you have limited options!<br/><br/><strong>Why implement a timer?</strong><br/><br/>Often times the hardest part of game dev is just getting started. The timer is used to keep the player on task and understand that we only need to work on the task at hand for the length of time given even if it's for just a few minutes. After each task you can take a break, continue on without the task or modifier, or take your gamble at the same or different task again but with potentially a different modifier / time limit) <br/><br/><strong>Why do you have modifiers that encourage staying offline / off the internet / phone?</strong><br/><br/>I feel these can be really powerful! I know it's hard because I know personally I want to watch a tutorial the second I run into ANYTHING I run into that I don't know how to do. But recalling information can be a strong part of the learning process, and thankfully, you can dive into a tutorial after the timer is up. But I would highly encourage you to try spending the time recalling the information yourself! <br/><br/><strong>Why do you have modifiers that have you use only pen and paper / \u00a0go into another room, I'm building my game and I need to be on my computer? What gives?</strong><br/>This one I especially love, cause I utilized this personally for this game jam funny enough. I think you can still get a lot of planning out of the way while using pen and paper and/or a different change in scenery. Some of my best ideas / troubleshooting come from when I'm away from my computer / write down what I'm working on, and then when I come back I have an easy blueprint to follow! :)<br/><br/><strong>Known Issues:</strong><br/><br/>\u2022 My <em><strong>\"Super Short [Game Jam Mode]</strong></em> that is <em>supposed</em> to have times of <em>3 mins or less</em>, <strong>actually has much longer times</strong> like <strong>17 minutes</strong>. How's that for irony when I tried to make it specifically to be a quick in and out option... it's <strong><em>great</em>, I love bugs! </strong><br/><br/>\u2022 The pause button is missing from the bottom right corner... Yup, similar to the game jam mode issue above,\u00a0 I'm bummed because<strong> I specifically had it made</strong> to be able to restart if anything went wrong. :(<br/><br/>\u2022 I forgot to export the build so it starts in windowed mode 1080p. Currently it goes to full screen. (If you have an ultrawide like me, you'll realize this is not a fun way for the game to open :(. Crappy work around: I turned off my ultrawide monitor so it would appear on my secondary 1080p 16:9 monitor)<br/><br/>\u2022 Some modifiers conflict with each other (eg.,\u00a0 challenge modifier: \"No use of the internet while progressing on your task\" but a helper modifier would be \"you can use 1 youtube video / reddit post/ google search to help you with you task\"\u00a0 Downloaded videos anyone? :)<br/><br/>\u2022 Bean collection is not working are not persistent through saves.<br/><br/>\u2022 Music / SFX is repetitive, may look into changing it down the road.<br/><br/>\u2022 UI can be slow to react to mouse hovering over options.<br/> \u2022<strong> </strong>Coffee Pouring SFX can be a little loud.\u2022 Timer can start at 00:00<br/>\u2022 \"Task help Modifier\" will give boosts although they player not meeting the requirement.<br/><br/><strong><br/>TODO:</strong><br/><br/>\u2022 Fix all major bugs<br/>\u2022 Add more modifiers <br/>\u2022 Add UI animations / SFX<br/>\u2022 WebGL Support (If I can get it down and running well)<br/><strong><br/>TODO if others find it would be helpful.</strong><br/>\u2022 Clock Ticking SFX?<br/>\u2022 Add an alarm to the clock when it hits zero (or gets close)?<br/>\u2022 Other Ideas to be rewarding to the player, eg., more options to spend beans on?<br/>\u2022 Scale bean reward quantity based of modifiers / time.?<br/>\u2022 Multiple Modifiers at once?<br/>\u2022 Task steaks to earn more beans. (every 10 tasks, you get a good chunk of beans)<br/>\u2022 Task skips<br/>\u2022 Gamify good habit tracking, \"No Zero Days\" philosophy.</p>\n<p>For anyone that got to play a little bit of the game! </p>\n<p>If you can think of other modifier ideas (both challenge(debuffs) and helper (buffs) I would love to add more on. Its pretty minimal right now and I tried to keep the modifiers broad (so it can maybe work with others tasks) which I may or may not need to change down the road.(I almost spent the whole 48 hours pondering other ideas and asking friends if they had other ideas! ) I would love any and all feedback as well as  hearing any suggestions on gamifying the development process to be more fun (I think game development is extremely fun in its own right, but when you need to sit down and grind, how would make it better in this context?)<br/><br/>Thank you again everyone! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:18:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/706/7066e1a64d7ef52f9ed8c2d966fecbf2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ghostwareinteractive"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
