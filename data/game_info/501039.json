Every time we thought we've found a way to defeat them, they somehow figured out our strategy. Now we now how - they posses the technology to loop time. Whenever we found a new way to fight them, they went back and adapted before we fired the first shot.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>But now we've got a chance to end it once and for all. We've located their temporal manipulation devices in a series of bases in this area. If we can destroy them, we'll be able to launch our final offensive.</p>\n<p>You've got to be quick, though - they know we're here and they're already preparing to loop us back. Destroy every base before that happens!</p>\n\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 47.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You start with a single factory rover. You can deploy the factory by selecting your rover and clicking it again. Once deployed, it will start producing drone units. Be careful, though - once deployed you can't move it until you repack it again.</p>\n<p>Use the button in the bottom-right of the screen to change the rally point of spawning drones. Attack enemy units and bases to gain more time to complete the mission. Killing enemies also grants you tech level points, which are required to unlock more advanced drones in your factory.</p>\n<p>Recover abandoned rovers to increase your drone production. Defeat enemies to unlock better drones. Destroy enemy bases. Good luck!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse. Use left-click to select vehicles and buildings, or deselect them by clicking on empty space. Use right-click to move your vehicles. Left-click selected vehicle/building to deploy/repack. Press &amp; drag with middle mouse button to move the camera. Use mouse scroll to zoom in/out.</p>\n<p>Tools:</p>\n<p>Unity 2020.1.4f1</p>\n<p>Visual Studio 2019</p>\n<p>GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.18</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57cbb92d8baa10c1f991c835a337dc3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lucas Stark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
