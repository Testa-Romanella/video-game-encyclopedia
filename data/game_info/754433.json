Collect and craft potions that transform you into the different elements, and bend the laws of nature to your will!</p>\n<p>Made over three days during the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge.</p>\n\r\nRULES\r\n\n<p>This chart, known as the 'Laws of Nature,' describes how much health will be gained or lost by a character in each elemental reaction. In this example, when YELLOW interacts with BLUE or vice versa, BLUE gets +1 health and YELLOW does not gain or lose health.</p>\n\n<p>In this example, when YELLOW interacts with GREEN or vice versa, YELLOW gets +1 health and GREEN gets -1 health.</p>\r\nCRAFTING\r\n\n<p>When you combine two potions, they become the next potion in the circle, moving clockwise. In this example, YELLOW + RED = GREEN and RED + GREEN = BLUE etc.</p>\n<p>If you combine two potions diagonally, they also continue clockwise, with the diagonal arrow being drawn from left to right, then moving clockwise along the circle. So, in this example: YELLOW + GREEN + BLUE and BLUE + RED + GREEN.</p>\n\r\nUPGRADES\r\n\n<p>Collecting orbs allows you to change the laws of nature. Grabbing an orb will change what happens to the orb's color when it interacts with your player's current color. So in this example, grabbing the orb will make subtract one from GREEN's interaction with BLUE, making the above number -2.</p>\n\n<p>That's all you need to know to play the game. Hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>p.s.
