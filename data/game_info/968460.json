Reuniting with old friends and fellow survivors of a tragic party night in Lakefield. A night that created and killed the Lakefield Slasher known to the press as Zombie. Now tormented by a stranger who knows what only the original Zombie could, Andrea and her friends have to come to terms that the killer might still be alive. <br/><br/>Reconnecting with old friends is scary. They know so much and so little about you at the same time. Are they going to like the person you\u2019ve become now? Can they afford to hold years of not communicating against each other while a killer is on the loose?<br/><br/>The world labeled him Zombie, but some of Andrea's friends remembered him as Trip Walinski. It started how they always do. A romance gone wrong, a party at an abandoned farm, and a one way ticket for a bad trip. Partying at moon rock farm was a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/><br/>Explore key locations in Lakefield. Get chased by the slasher, Zombie. Fight back using pallets, slamming doors, blinding with your flashlight, and out maneuver the killer with slides and vaults. The game transitions between key locations and character perspectives with pixelated comic styled cutscenes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-27T06:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc62bb2c19f410b11db7f67194ee20ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Noah Lewin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Day Dreamer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
