You also need to plant in case they are <em>harvested</em> or eaten by crows. Don't get killed by the angry red crows as well!</p>\r\nMaster Planting Guide\r\n<p>Get seeds from the barrel on the top-right of the farm. Yellow seeds are potato seeds. They take shorter time to full grown but give less money. <br/>Green seeds are carrot seeds. They take longer time to sell but give more money.<br/>When there are both types of seeds in the sack, <strong>carrot</strong> is preferentially planted. <br/>After you planted, you need to get water from the lake at the south to the farm. Water is given to the farm section <strong>first</strong> stepped on. <br/>To harvest, attack it.</p>\r\nKeys\r\n<p>WASD - Move<br/><br/>Left Click - Attack / Plant Seed<br/><br/>Right Click - Grab Seeds / Fill Water Bucket<br/><br/>TAB - Open Upgrade Menu<br/><br/>ESC - Open Pause Menu<br/><br/>P - Restart</p>\r\nUpgrades:\r\n<p>Increase player speed </p>\n<p>Increase sack capacity</p>\n<p>Increase water capacity</p>\n<p>Increase attack range</p>\n<p>Deploy scarecrow (Kill crows in range instantly, with a cost of 1 time remain.
