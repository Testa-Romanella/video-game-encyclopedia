The child behind the plate chooses what to eat. When the item is not liked, the child throws it away (just like in real life, yep.). The child especially does not like root vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>To play the game: only eat the sweets (swipe down, into your mouth) and throw away (swipe up) the root vegetables to win. The game is over, when you either swipe a food into the wrong direction or the plate is full.</p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Artist 1: Lisa (9)\r\n</p>\n<p>Artist 2: Mira (4)\r\n</p>\n<p>Music by\u00a0KaiLiauw\r\n</p><p>https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/picky-eater-4<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T06:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/424/4248b0e4c4b62b4c8a815722b517aa17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jinxedbyte"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
