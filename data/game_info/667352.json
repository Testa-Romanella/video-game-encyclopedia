By pressing the shift key, the player\u00a0will put away their gun and hold up a shield for 1/2 of a second.\u00a0If any attacks hit at this time, the player will gain one\u00a0use of a special attack. If the player does not take\u00a0damage during this time, it takes one extra second to\u00a0re-equip the pistol or parry.</p>\n<p>2. Up to 3 special attacks can be stored at once. By\u00a0pressing right-click, the player will fire a more powerful\u00a0blast from their pistol than normal.</p>\n<p>3. Added a HUD element that displays the number of special attacks\u00a0that the player has available to them at any given point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Created by: Aidan O'Rourke</p>\n<p>With assets from MSU</p>\n<p>Songs:</p>\n<p>Abyssal Time - Devil May Cry 5</p>\n<p>Blazing Muscle - Devil May Cry 5</p>\n<p>Both composed by Yoshiya Terayama</p>\n<p>The parry sound effect is taken from\u00a0Street Fighter III: Third Strike</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:26:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/8389b71aec586bdec5fdc5a2136c3ae9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Aidan O'Rourke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
