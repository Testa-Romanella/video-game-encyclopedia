You are the Captain of Earth&#39;s very first interstellar ship. That&#39;s good. Really good. So very good. There&#39;s just one small problem. Barely worth mentioning but a hostile alien race known as the Scryve want to exterminate us. We need you to go find allies, discover and use these so-called Precursor relics to upgrade your ship and try to avoid getting eaten along the way so that you can save humanity. We don&#39;t want you to feel pressure though. Just the very future of the human race rests on your shoulders.</p>\n<p>You can pre-order Star Control\u00ae: Origins now and get access to the Betas. Do so and you get the game at a discount as the price will rise the closer we get to finishing.</p>\n<p>Beta 1: Fleet Battles. Assemble your ships into a fleet and take them into combat online, against devious computer opponents or against your soon-to-be former friend sitting next to you. You can also craft your own ships and fight with them and share them online. Available 11/16/17<br />\nBeta 2: World Maker. Build your own worlds, share them or add worlds others create. Then send your Lander to explore the surface, find relics and fight alien creatures. Available: This Winter.<br />\nBeta 3: Creator of Universes. Create a universe...within a universe! Alternatively, download universes others make and visit them and find out their stories, aliens, ships, planets! Available: After this Winter.<br />\nFinal release: When it&#39;s done. Seriously, you&#39;ll tell us when it&#39;s ready. Right? I mean you wouldn&#39;t just make us work on this forever. That would be wrong. Cruel even.
