Then each morning she would fall lifeless where she stood. You see Poppet is a doll, and she\u2019s always been in the attic. She\u2019s always had her window. Oh the others? Does it matter what they do all night? They\u2019re just other toys after all. How could they matter? As long as Poppet had her window, all was right in the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>However tonight she woke up in a box, this wasn\u2019t her window. In fact this was on the other side of the attic. But how did she get here? Why was she in this box? She had to make it back, the voice in her head said so, and it wasn\u2019t about to be denied.\r\n</p>\n<p>But a curious pair of eyes watched, a harlequin girl, a ghost living in the paintings who claimed they weren\u2019t always toys, and that Poppet wasn\u2019t always at the window. But that\u2019s preposterous! The window was all Poppet knew\u2026 right? The voice in her head seemed to say so, but another voice\u2026 One she hadn\u2019t heard in a long time, her own inner voice said differently.\r\n</p>\n<p>Would she set out as the harlequin girl suggested to free herself? Or return to her\u00a0 window as the other voice wanted her to do? What really is the secret behind the attic? Why are there so many toys here? Why do they all move at night? How did anyone get there? Questions, questions, questions\u2026 One thing is for certain, it\u2019s going to be a very long night. A great many cursed toys live in this attic, and not all of them are friendly.</p>\n\n\n<p>Currently added:</p>\n<p>1. Combat areas are entirely randomly generated.\r\n</p>\n<p>2.
