This game allows for User vs Computer, Local Multiplayer, LAN Multiplayer, and Online Multiplayer. Online Multiplayer requires you to connect with a friend, with the \"Host\" requiring to portforward the port \"8049\" and giving your friend your external ip.\u00a0 There are 18 colors to choose from and supports fullscreen. There is also a hardmode color for an extra challenge if you'd like. The computer has 3 levels of difficulty which build on its playing style.</p><p>Originally made for the GDU Jam 4, this was my first attempt at learning networking with Gamemaker: Studios.
