I've noticed some of the bugs that some players are facing is due to a spaghetti of old code that has been deprecated. May also remove the flips aswell (Let me know what you guys think about that in the comment section). If you like to follow the update, I'll be posting it all on My Twitter. </p><p>Thanks.</p><p>______________________________________________________________<br/></p><p>Hello all,\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThank you all for the support and love, really means a whole bunch.
