Test your reaction skills in this touch game with a realistic physics engine that can change at the tilt of your device.<br/><br/>Hold down on the screen to create new bubbles. The purpose is to fill as much of the available game space as possible until you move to the next round. You only have 20 bubbles to finish each round and more bubble busters appear to bust your bubbles each round. Every 5 rounds you receive an extra life.
