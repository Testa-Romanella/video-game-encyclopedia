There is only one limit, which might actually be good in general - in the demo you can only save 10 pieces of art in your gallery. However, our plans with <strong>Kaleidocraft </strong>are to develop it with the help of our community for a long time. Since we are just two people, we are not sure we can support two communities, so currently <strong>Kaleidocraft </strong>is available as a demo and in Early Access on Steam. We are also a part of the Steam Games Festival - Summer Edition, and we will be doing Live Streams of <strong>Kaleidocraft </strong>starting today and until June 22nd.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T05:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/97771ae962eedf5910b1f267c9faa1bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valiant Game Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
