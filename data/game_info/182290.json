It was cathardic to make, it was as if my brain forced me to make it (having lost a full night of sleep working on it), and it relates directly to a set of very specific aspects of my life. It is nothing short of a diary entry.</p>\n<p>Which is why you probably won't enjoy the game, unless you're into 'art' games. It uses game mechanics and rules to tell a story. Don't look for the story in words or cut-scenes, instead, examine the actions you do and the rules of the environment around you. Though the game is my diary entry, it is certainly open to interpretation.</p>\n<p>There are 3 endings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e62/e621057e3988e5b81eb2409a2e06b1e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shiny Ogre Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
