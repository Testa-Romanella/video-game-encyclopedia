{"id": 537413, "slug": "plague-md", "name": "Plague MD", "name_original": "Plague MD", "description": "<p>Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator.</p>\n<p>Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences.</p>\n\n\n<p>Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask.</p>\n<p>\u2022 The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget\u00a0<br/>a blow to the head instead of anesthesia.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort.</p>\n\n<p>All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health.</p>\n<p>Always contact a specialist!</p>\n<p>ACHTUNG! The game is available on WinOS now, but we are going to\u00a0upload Mac and Linux versions later</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T04:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/181/181f1f23ac47a9ce8bd3d1e7443fbbf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 219, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CosCom Art Group"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
