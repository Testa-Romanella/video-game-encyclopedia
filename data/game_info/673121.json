Invasive species choke out the understory. Animals are left without room to graze. Hosts of insects spread disease and consume trees. Fire-dependent species struggle to survive. And the threat of catastrophic wildfire looms over the dry and crowded forests, where a single lightning strike can ignite the overcrowded understory like a tinderbox, spreading flames to the crowns of the pines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s up to you to bring balance to nature. Reintroduce fire to these fire dependent ecosystems on your own terms. And when wildfire strikes, use the techniques you\u2019ve learned to fight back!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Our game, made for the 2021 Games4SocialImpact Jam at the University of Pittsburgh,\u00a0addresses the disastrous wildfires that have become more common as a result of fire suppression laws. It seeks to educate players on the healthy role of fire in an ecosystem and the practice of prescribed burns. It may seem that players are made to \u201cruin\u201d forests with prescribed fires, but in reality, they\u2019re preventing the spread of truly ruinous wildfires.<br/></p>\n<p>Cycle through actions with \"1\".
