Use the analog stick, WASD or the arrow keys to move around. Use almost any controller face button, space bar or the left mouse button to swing your shovel.</p>\n<p>Some enemies will leave a roasted Life Chicken behind. These refill your life bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was named by my five-year-old son. It's a silly little game, but I hope that you have fun with it.</p>\n<p>Note: The MacOS version is completely untested! I have no idea if it works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T09:05:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a126de1b9983d9b93099ca135f43364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kwame's Junk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
