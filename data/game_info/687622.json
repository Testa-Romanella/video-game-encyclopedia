She worships an entity called \"Nihasa\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entity is called Nihasa, and well, they are a demon. A cat demon. They are the one who proposes to Lilly to do a ritual, which in turn, would give her powers. They don't expect her to actually do it, since they think she is too stupid to manage that. They don't care that much about their followers too.</p>\n<p>The owners are... Not that intelligent. I guess it suits the cat. They're very\u00a0common and don't have any interesting features to be commented on.
