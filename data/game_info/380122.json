{"id": 380122, "slug": "orb-override", "name": "Orb Override", "name_original": "Orb Override", "description": "<p>Orb Override is a short and simple real time strategy game where the goal is to claim all of your enemy's orbs. However, you start with nothing but a command line to try and navigate the virtual space. Find an enemy, claim a nearby orb, and then try to prevent your enemy from taking over the system.<br/></p><p>To capture new orbs from your claimed orb, you need to select an orb you own, then select an orb you can target. Peeps will be transfered from your selected orbs to your target orb, and if you have enough Peeps, you will take over the orb.</p>\n\n<p>This was a fun lil game to make as I haven't programmed in C# in some time, but Unity got me back into it. I hope it is as fun for you to play as it was for me to make.<br/></p>\n<p>~MusicBlox</p>\n<p>Submission for Ludum Dare 45 Compo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/104/1045dca3e0fac1415b212e649bc50a82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MusicBlox"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
