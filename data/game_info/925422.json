The output is a data model that can be shared with friends and family. Your playstyle is essentially encoded in the data model.</p>\n<p>In the \"Remember Them\" mode, players can load a data model file and play with them..</p>\n<p>Developer note (v1.0): I'm still learning more about neural networks and tweaking them to capture more of how any particular player approaches the game. There is room for improvement.\u00a0I've encountered a bug where sometimes the saved model doesn't chase the rabbit. In that case, I recommend playing Remember Me mode again to give it another chance</p>\n<p>Credits:Ambient Wave 48 (Tribute) by Eroika, a sound created as a tribute to the creator's friend who passed (Freesound - 496757)</p>\n<p>City Park Ambiance by Felix.Blume (Freesound - 667060)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T06:30:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b146445b091612a1dac9b0e80361ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Omey Salvi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
