Since I'm an absolute nit at both and I noticed that no one or only a few program anything, I thought I'd program a little game for the community and this project. It's the first time I programmed a 2d game, normally I program more functional. That's why I had to put in a few more hours here, but I'm happy with the work and hope you find this a cool idea and play 1-2 rounds of HAPECOLLECT :)</p><p>By @NoelW or @NoelW#5532</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/affb18815675508ce2a44e564416c7ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Niclas Grunau"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
