Everything needs to be locked when you leave, so you'll have to carry a key around you at all times.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Fullscreen was a bit iffy, so just maximize the window. Control with WASD. You need to get as many toys as you can to the\u00a0donation station at the end of the map. You have 2 minutes.
