{"id": 10709, "slug": "fourtex-jugo", "name": "Fourtex Jugo", "name_original": "Fourtex Jugo", "description": "Fourtex Jugo (from the Japanese for \"15\") is an abstract strategy game with a high degree of difficulty, played on a grid of tiles. Your goal is to optimize each initial layout to beat the target score, and to compete on the leaderboards, or against your personal best score. Progress through each level involves combining three types of particles with each other to ultimately create void. By manipulating the void optimally, you can achieve your goal of meeting or exceeding the target score specified for each particular level, indicating your mastery of that level. For extra challenge, attempt to reach the target score without any particle interaction with the void. You'll need to create your particles and voids at the right times and in the right places to reach your goal.Demo Version<br/>Play Jugo for free.

The difficulty of this for a particular level ranges from difficult to extremely challenging.<br/><br/>Another goal for winning a level is to get 2 stars by using the voids effectively, to get even higher scores than are usually possible in a perfect game, and compete for highest score.<br/><br/>This game can also be played as a casual game by simply completing a level to get 1 star.Not a math puzzle<br/>The most basic tier of particles currently are represented with numbered pieces. The Arabic numerals are a widely recognized sequence, used here to help predict a new particle. Combining similar numbered particles creates the particle with the next highest number, up until 15 (which begins the next tier of 3 more basic particles). A second way to combine the numbered particles is to add particles that have a compatible color hue. But for those who think better with numbers, and for accessibility reasons, these color-compatible pairs also add to 15. The pairs of numbers that add to 15 represent the only math that could be necessary or useful in this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/54645cea02fe8cec07dd43d695f128ca.jpg", "website": "http://saltydog.digital/jugo/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Salty Dog Digital"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Salty Dog Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
