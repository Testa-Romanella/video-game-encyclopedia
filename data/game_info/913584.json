You cannot just arrange the plants randomly, since not every plant is a nice neighbor to others. Therefore you have to study the needs and effects of each plant and find the best arrangement/assembly.</p>\n<p>The plants work similiar to a card deck and you can get them from the moving belt on the left screen. You can only get the topmost plant. But dont worry, you can also shift the whole plant queue as you like. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: <br/></strong>Move: WASD / LEFT StickUse: Space / A-Buton<br/>Quit: ESC</p><p>Reset-Button: Go to the reset panel (ingame) and press \"use\" button.
