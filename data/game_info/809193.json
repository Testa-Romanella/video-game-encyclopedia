The land within your new fenced area will be cultivated and ready for sewing.</p>\n<p>Try to trap Crop-Barrows in fenced areas and they'll lay seeds in the furrowed land for you.</p>\n<p>Other barrows have Chainsaws and Scythes that are out to make your job harder. Chainsaws cut through fences (try to avoid them cutting the fence you're laying), whilst Scythes will destroy your crops.</p>\n<p>Reach the target 'croppage' to progress to the next, harder day.</p>\n<p>Use the cursor keys, WASD or your controller's d-pad to move your tractor.</p>\n<p>SPACE or START clears the instructional screen.</p>\n<p>I got some sounds from www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>The graphics are all from Synty Studios' Unity assets - www.syntystore.com</p>\n<p>This has been my FIRST EVER GAME JAM!
