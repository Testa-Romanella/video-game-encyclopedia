It was made over about a month~ in 2014. I was the sole programmer and it was made in game maker.<br/><br/>I learned a lot from this, and you'll probably notice it's pretty clunky and doesn't do anything to teach you about the game. The ? button (hotkey R) will help a little, but mostly it needs a manual. <br/><br/></p><p>There's no AI, it just supports hotseat play. Each team takes turns moving 3 pieces which can move and take an action. You can shoot, melee, or use a power. There are 4 debuffs (scorch, shock, frost and corrosion), and the hit and armor mechanics are a bit overdesigned.</p><p>There was one version after this that had two more map setups and proper credits and a proper splash that tries to explain the game a little, and if I find it I'll replace the EXE.<br/><br/></p><p>Oh, and I recommend you mute it through your sound mixer. A friend of mine made music for it, but I think it's a little grating on the ears. Just a heads up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea6b6678afd96639facef874b5f1ede.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiesetsu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
