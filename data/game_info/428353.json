The main cast is supported by a large ensemble of (female) side characters, each with their own story to tell. Will you romance Bella, or develop a different relationship with her? Do you want to discover what secret Susan is hiding? Rachel is clearly an open-minded girl, but is she daring enough to allow you into her life? Liza&#39;s boyfriend is a verified douchebag, but do you care enough for her to oust him from her life entirely?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T21:32:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd1317550ac8b65b7ceb9668e10f433.jpg", "website": "https://perverteer.com/sisterly-lust", "rating": 4.6, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 38, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 28, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Perverteer Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Perverteer Games"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
