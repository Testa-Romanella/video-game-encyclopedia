Like its enormously popular predecessor 100 Balls \u2013 which has been downloaded over 13 million times and ranked No. 1 in over 70 countries -- 100 Balls 3D is simple to grasp but difficult to master. Here\u2019s how to play:<br/><br/>You start by tapping your screen to open a kind of \u201ctrap door\u201d on the bottom of a container. Since the container is suspended in the air, the balls are pulled by gravity towards the ground.<br/><br/>Your task is to prevent these falling balls from hitting the ground by catching them in your cup. Once your cup is filled to the top, it automatically cycles back to the top of the container and dumps its contents. You then get a brand new, empty cup with which to catch yet more balls.<br/><br/>You can play for less than 5 minutes or for more than 5 hours: it\u2019s up to you! Plus, you can hit the pause button anytime for a break in the action (or because you\u2019re getting late for work or school!)<br/><br/>***Get High Scores***<br/>While all cups work the same, they aren\u2019t all created equal. Colored cups (e.g. blue, green and pink) produce colored balls, which are worth more. There are also cool balls like \u201cmagnet balls\u201d, which as the name suggests, attract other balls \u2013 which could either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how much room is left in your cup.<br/><br/>*** Challenging Levels***<br/>And you\u2019d expect, each level is slightly more challenging than the one before as the cups speed up. However, unlike some other games, higher levels aren\u2019t impossible or frustrating, and getting an impressive score within a few hours of playing is realistic.<br/><br/>***Amazing Graphics &amp; Sound***<br/>If you\u2019re one of the MILLIONS of people who love 100 Balls, then \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen anything yet!\u201d That\u2019s because 100 Balls 3D features amazing 3D graphics, with crisp colors and fine attention to detail. You\u2019ll be blown away by the view!<br/>The sound and music are also perfect for the app. Take a listen and hear for yourself!<br/><br/>***Realistic Physics Engine***<br/>100 Balls 3D is built with a realistic physics engine. The responsiveness is lifelike, which is important because the game is essentially based on reactions, reflexes and timing. Anything less than precision would create a sloppy gaming experience where luck was as valuable as skill. That\u2019s definitely not the case with 100 Balls 3D.<br/><br/>***Scoreboard &amp; Leaderboard***<br/>Track your best games on the scoreboard, and compete against your friends via the Leaderboard.
