You play as an adventurer setting out to explore the cave and find out what riches it holds. However, you are not the only one...<br/><br/>As you delve deeper in to the cave, you'll discover new areas to explore, new weapons and new monsters to try them out on.<strong>Smart Characters!</strong>Throughout your journey you will encounter AI characters. Some friendly, some hostile.

There is no escape. Be afraid!<strong>Platformer Roguelike!</strong> Caveblazers is a modern platformer which incorporates some Roguelike and RPG elements such as permanent death, randomized potion identities, an RPG-style inventory system and tons of items, equipment and upgrades!<strong>Daily Challenge Runs!</strong><strong>Each day a new adventure will be generated!</strong> It will be the same for everyone and you'll only get one chance at it! These challenge runs give you a starting loadout, and feature a set of different traits.<strong>Epic Boss Battles!</strong>Between each area you'll encounter a boss. <strong>Each boss is very unique, requiring a different strategy to defeat.</strong> Bosses are generally gigantic monstrosities with life bars stretching across the entire screen.
