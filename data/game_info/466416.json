Some of the futher out islands are not done{no docks or buildings}\u00a0but you are able to explore them . Its very early and i have big plans for it. This also has 2 modes 1 being the low res psx style from the walking sim game and a non low res{normal mode}. i also have a very minor soundtrack {2 songs} but plan to add more. This project is a little more ambitious then walking sim. The boat controls are abit wonky and hard to control but just be patient.</p>\n\n<p>If you get lost the Map is in the banner{the starting island is where the arrow is pointing} its so large in the boat it takes about 10-15 minutes to get from one end to the other end\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls\u00a0</p>\n<p>1.WASD To walk[Same with boat}</p>\n<p>2.Number1 to mount the boat, number 2 to dismount{will spawn you on top yes you can walk on it}</p>\n<p>3.F to use flashlight</p>\n<p>4.Ctrl to crouch</p>\n<p>5.
