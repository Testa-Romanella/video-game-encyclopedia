Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she\u2019s the only Human who can wield magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sofya\u2019s loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofya\u2019s childhood love and the Emperor\u2019s daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerina\u2019s rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city\u2014and Sofya\u2019s heart.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofya\u2019s life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story.<br/><br/>While the characters of Echoes of the Fey play RiftRealms with Sofya, they reveal their own prejudices and beliefs through their strategies. They serve as \u201cdungeon masters\u201d who try to create a gaming experience for Sofya (and thus the player) that is both entertaining and challenging. Kind and compassionate characters like Heremon might slip up by making the game too easy, while ruthless characters like Arkady transform the game into a harrowing experience.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite her hardships, Sofya gets many chances to find love amidst her adventures. She can forge a romantic bond with Nikolai, Heremon, Katerina, or Arkady as she tries to escape the dangers of her predicament.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-15T10:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff45e3fa65f33ab7d3702be9924d1c4.jpg", "website": "http://woodsy-studio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Woodsy Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Woodsy Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
