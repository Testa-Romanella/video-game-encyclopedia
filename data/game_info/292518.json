We wanted to inspire the future generation of coders using a fun and accessible game.\u00a0</p><p>It's a video game, but the only way to move your character is by entering functions into a separate text file. The game reads the data from the file and compiles it as a program, then executes it. By using simple functions such as MoveRight(3) and Jump(2), kids can learn how to string multiple functions together to accomplish a task. And if kids are stuck, they can read the simple english documentation on our beautifull website.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the game will provide feedback in real time. If you make a mistake in the program, it tells you exactly where the problem is. If you hit a wall or spike while the program is running, that's called a \"runtime error.\" By introducing concepts in a simple but iterative manner, we are able to engage kids and adults alike in order to create the next generation of coders.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f7/1f75e3f660c7de02c0fa07a3b7de3849.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheJadeRabbit0", "bean borg"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
