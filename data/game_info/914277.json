{"id": 914277, "slug": "mummies-2", "name": "Mummies!!!", "name_original": "Mummies!!!", "description": "<p>Originally published in 2014 or before elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Play as an archaeologist in a hat excavating the tombs of Egypt while avoiding its resident mummies in this update of the classic arcade maze game.<br/></p>\n<p>This was an updated remake of Oh Mummy for the Amstrad CPC, featuring a gun powerup which you could use to shoot the mummies with the WASD keys. There are 2 types of mummies: a slow pharaoh mummy that is invulerable to gunfire, and fast-moving, but random-moving mummies. Both are vulnerable to the magic scroll. Your bullets are limited and carry over to the next room. The count at the bottom of the screen shows your remaining bullets.<br/></p>\n<p>The game picks up speed and introduces more mummies at the start of a room as you get further into the game. You win if you clear 10 rooms. To escape from a room, find a key and the sarcophagus from a crate. Then, exit the room from the now-unlocked door. To open a create, dig from all 4 sides by walking <strong>against </strong>its sides. Once a crate has been fully dug from all 4 sides (corners excluded), whatever is inside will be released.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T12:20:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aef/aef79517cdeaed7a48ea108f3ab9618b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
