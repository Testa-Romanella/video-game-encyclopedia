Randomly generated, so each playthrough is different! <br/>Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just slow you down. <br/>Quick to pick up and play. Unlike most roguelikes, Possession 2 doesn't require you to memorize dozens of weird key commands, or puzzle over confusing skill and ability lists before you start playing. <br/>Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination of the two. <br/>Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change the ones already there. <br/>@ Choice between ASCII or Graphical mode, for the oldschool roguelike fans.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccf/ccf974d014b33cdbc9bb91a85fd282e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["weirdfellows"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
