This is the most common method used to play over the Internet.</li><li>Wi-Fi cell phone hotspot : Requires running off the same Wi-Fi cell phone hotspot. This method only works if everyone playing is in the same house.</li><li>Virtual LAN over Internet : Requires a VPN that supports Virtual LAN over Internet.
