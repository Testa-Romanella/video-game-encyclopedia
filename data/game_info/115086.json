{"id": 115086, "slug": "umbrella-unfinished", "name": "Umbrella (Unfinished)", "name_original": "Umbrella (Unfinished)", "description": "<p>So me and two friends of mine decided to make our ever first game, in a game jam...\u00a0\u00a0and as you can see it didn't go that well... which lead to this... game? It's almost \u00a0unplayable to be honest...<br/><br/>Things didn't work out as we thought it would, there was a lot of bugs and errors that would take a whole afternoon to fix. So for beginners like us\u00a0it would be pretty much impossible to finish their first completed game in three days. Maybe we were too ambitious, maybe the organization wasn't\u00a0 a focus point enough. But at least we tried to create something. It was quite the challenge and even if we failed miserably, we've learned a lot. Maybe with this\u00a0lesson we'll be able to do it better next year... or even lauching a full game, who knows?<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Alright, enough rambling around, we created more of a concept: you move the player with the arrow keys, attack with the space bar and defend with the control key.\u00a0 You have this energy bar that gets charged whenever you defend (having in mind it should only charge up whenever an enemy attacks while you're holding your shield/umbrella) and gets consumed whenever you attack. When the energy bar is empty, your attacks become pretty much useless. Also, health points are scarce (increasing the game's difficulty) and there's only a few of health packs around the whole game, usually well hidden, inviting the player to explore. And that's pretty much it.<br/></p>\n\n<p>We might make a \"remaster\" of this game for people to enjoy it properly, but it might take a while to finish it. But it'll be done.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b2e/b2e15e3b1f5c58dfe64a6e1014983fb7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Smiley Demon"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
