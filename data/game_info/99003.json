The engine itself was designed around the ability to be capable of executing a battle and in the future may expand from that to include Menu System and Map exploration. Stats for all the creatures and jobs are aimed at being as close to the original game's documented numbers and formulas as can be.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe entire thing is implemented in AWT by scratch and could definitely use a rewrite, or even just be ported to something better, like RPG Maker.  Don't expect too much out of it, as it was supposed to be no more than a college assignment and conceptual demo.<br/><br/>All the content is based on MLP, with the 6 classes reflecting the 6 main ponies.  Even the map, backgrounds, enemies, and shops are reflective of NES styled pixelized versions of the show.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nProgramming and Graphics\r\n<p>\r\n\tNicholas Hydock <br/>\n</p>\r\nSprites\r\n<p>\r\n\tVarious Monsters and Characters - Pony Noia <br/>\r\n\tElements of Harmony - Kortallis</p>\r\n\r\n\tMusic\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor Equestria (Intro Music) - MandoPony <br/>\r\n\tVictory and Game Over fanfare - Kil6969 <br/>\r\n\tBattle theme - Kil6969<br/>\r\n\tDerpy's Shop - MandoPony</p>\r\n\r\n\tAdditional Resources\r\n<p>\r\n\tFF1 Recorded Data</p>\r\n\r\n\t3rd-Party Libraries\r\n<p>\r\n\tJLayer <br/>\r\n\tini4j\r\n</p>\n<p>Source code is available at https://github.com/nhydock/FF1-Battle-System</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9a/e9a3b64477e38efff4247d1baa4aa1ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nhydock"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
