You are also a Night Creature, a being that's not quite human. One day, a Weary Newcomer appears, seeking rest and (not) romance. Yet, when your eyes meet, neither can look away...</p>\n<p>Rancher's Romance is a solo RPG created for the 1 Page RPG Jam. You play as a Reluctant Rancher who's more focused on maintaining their ranch than trying to find love, but with the arrival of a Weary Newcomer, you may just change your mind. A small wrinkle(?) is the fact that you are a Night Creature, which is something most people don't bring up on the first date.</p>\n<p>Encounter Events and try to connect with the Newcomer, or maybe you'll decide the life of a lone cowpoke is what suits you best.
