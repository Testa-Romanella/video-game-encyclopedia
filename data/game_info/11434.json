Earthlings survived the invasion of hostile aliens - and were able to repel him. The battles were not even on the planet Earth itself, but at the space station. And at this station there were many traces of carnage. From blood to parts of aliens, from holes in the walls from bullets and shells to broken glass. And now all this must be cleaned, collected, and the garbage must be thrown away. A game about space janitors, and an extraordinary task for them.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In the course of the game, it is necessary to solve the tasks related to cleaning up of the huge space station, which survived the battle between the inhabitants of the Earth and the alien invaders, from the dirt and debris. It is necessary to remove the most diverse and exotic garbage: remains of bodies of aliens and earthlings, shot casings and broken glass, medicines for the wounded, weapons and who knows what else. It is necessary to wash the floors and walls of blood and soot, to seal holes from bullets in walls, ceilings and floors.</p>\n<p>As tools, players have a mop to wash out stains, a special device for detecting biological remains, and a PDA. You can interact with garbage and simply with the help of hands.</p>\n<p>At each level there are devices for cleaning and recycling garbage: an incineration plant, a source of clean water, a container in which smaller debris is placed, such as cans, liners and body parts, a welding device for repairing holes in walls, and a vending machine where the player can get lights, medicines, a &quot;wet floor&quot; sign, other signs and lamps. Sometimes these devices work incorrectly and produce even more pollution.</p>\n<p>The player can figure out how to use improvised tools to speed up and simplify cleaning. On the other hand, the player should think about how his actions will affect the situation and will not lead to even more pollution and the need to clean the same place several times.</p>\n<p>After passing each level, the player enters the so-called &quot;The Office&quot;. This is the place where the work done at this level is summed up. The player sees what he missed to draw conclusions for the future. In this place you can also get things as a reward for the work done.</p>\n<p>The cleaning takes up any amount of time, but there are penalties for poorly executed work. If less than 75% of the territory is taken away, the player can be fired and he will lose all the accumulated achievements.</p>\n<h3>Additions.</h3>\n<p>There are several additions to the game. The gameplay in these additions is the same as in the main game, but setting is different.</p>\n<p>Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior is set in the first chapter of the Flying Wild Hog&#39;s Shadow Warrior, cleaning up the mess.</p>\n<p>Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa&#39;s Rampage - the action takes place on the North Pole, and you have to clean up behind the crazy Santa Claus, in his workshop.</p>\n<p>A Halloween DLC pack entitled Viscera Cleanup Detail: House of Horror, featuring a crime scene of a house, where an unsolved mass murder has happened, while the player gets to uncover it during the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-09T16:34:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c6/3c6d71166b38e29f78b01b97828e2682.jpg", "website": "http://www.runestorm.com/viscera", "rating": 3.41, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 73, "owned": 1496, "beaten": 76, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 46, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 118, "suggestions_count": 508, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 119, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RuneStorm"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RuneStorm"], "esrb_rating": null}
