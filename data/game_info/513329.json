The game attempts to set an environment which makes the player feel uncomfortable and uneasy but also speaks towards the traumas of self-loathing and isolation. This piece may not be able to encapsulate these ideas in their entirety and to an extent may be a bit over the top but it is an attempt to share a fragment of the emotions one can go through. <br/><br/>The game has two endings in which are decided at critical moments within the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e37907aa965b861fc2f1ea4f1790b165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BPigeon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
