Players link arms with the head of the worm as they chase and add players to their tail. But beware! They are also vying to decapitate the worm, and if a link is broken, all the detached players are free. The game ends when the head loses its tail. How long will your worm survive?</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Wurmus is best experienced with a gamepad and headphones. Press WASD to move, use a mouse or press\u00a0QE to turn, or use the analog thumb sticks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b0c945e917cfb6e1979d29ec582938e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["shiftBacktick"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
