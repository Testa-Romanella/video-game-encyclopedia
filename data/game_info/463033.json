Together, they battle demons, seduce locals, and learn a little about themselves along the way. And probably cause massive property damage.</p>\n<p><strong>This visual novel is currently heavily work-in-progress.\u00a0</strong>Patreon members will gain access to all monthly updates while the general public will gain access to builds every other month.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This game will contain NSFW lewd scenes between male characters.</strong>\u00a0These scenes pop up occasionally throughout the story as characters grow more intimate. View at your own discretion. It's very gay.</p>\n<p>If you like my art, feel free to follow me on Twitter here!

If on Android, simply download the new build and install it. It should automatically update the version of the game you have installed. If on Windows/MAC/Linux, simply delete the old Repeat game folder and download the new build. Your saves are stored in your local files, so they should be retained after the update.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please note that the Android version is not stable on all Android devices. It is recommended that you play the PC, MAC, or Linux versions when possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:29:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00a0831983f3efd11a9a64d4711a8758.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["shirokoi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
