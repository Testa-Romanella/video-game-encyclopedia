I challenged myself to not add combat to this game, and I think it worked out well!</p><p>Follow me on Twitter to see future projects!<br/></p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Cycle Items - Q</p>\n<p>Use Items - E</p>\n<p>Mute Sound - N</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Theme</strong></p>\n<p>With the theme being \"delay the inevitable\" I thought of a rising tide that cannot be stopped.\u00a0 My take in this game is that you are rushing to collect as much treasure and see as much as you can before you eventually perish in the flood.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Last Breath is different than many other games I've made, and has much more emphasis on exploration.\u00a0 While there _is_ a leaderboard, the game is much better enjoyed just running around and trying to find all 7 of the pre-fabs that can be spawned across the cave. You must use your ladder, bomb, and pick to mine and climb through the sometimes difficult terrain.</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Tips for playing</strong></p>\n<p>- You cannot mine upwards, but you CAN use your bomb to clear upwards.</p>\n<p>- Ladder launches are a \"feature\" :wink: <br/>- You cannot place ladders while in the air, unless you are climbing on something else</p>\n<p>- Ladders and water negate fall damage</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Tools used</strong></p>\n<p>### Art</p>\n<p>- Aseprite</p>\n<p>- GIMP</p>\n<p>### Code</p>\n<p>- Godot 3.4</p>\n<p>- VSCode</p>\n<p>### Sound Effects</p>\n<p>- Various open license ambient noise clips modded and spliced for the right cave sounds :smiley: <br/>- jsfxr<br/></p>\n<p>- ChipTone<br/></p>\n<p>- Audacity</p>\n<p>### Hosting</p>\n<p>- Gitlab pages</p>\n<p>- Itch.io</p>\n<p>### Continuous Deployment</p>\n<p>- Gitlab CI/CD</p>\n<p>### Leaderboard</p>\n<p>- NodeJS</p>\n<p>- MongoDB</p>\n<p>- Digital Ocean App Platform</p><p>\n</p><p><strong>Known bugs</strong></p>\n<p>- Some prefabs may place over eachother</p>\n<p>- Seeds are not exactly repeatable, need to centralize the RNG system so it works.</p>\n<p>- Some browsers struggle with the sound effects and cause nearly unplayable sound lag. You can mute or more recommended is to use Chrome.</p>\n<p>- The game can lag as too many water tiles are placed eventually. Desktop version helps a lot.</p>\n<p>- Mac version builds are currently failing. (Sorry Apple folks :sob:)</p><p>C<strong>ut Content</strong></p>\n<p>- Drill item pickup for quicker mining</p>\n<p>- More variance in score item pickups besides the two implemented</p>\n<p>- Ride-able minecarts and tracks</p>\n<p>- Randomly placed torches that can be picked up and used and also go out when submerged in water</p>\n<p>- Glowstick items</p>\n<p>- Other types of liquids</p>\n<p>- Harpoon rope/grapple thing to cross gaps or climb upwards better</p>\n<p>- Usable player item pickups throughout the cave</p>\n<p>- Autotile the cave tiles to look better</p>\n<p>- Revamp mining system to allow for easier implementation of additional tile types</p>\n<p>- A base \"rising water\" line that goes up every few seconds. This would force the player to eventually drown no matter how clever they get.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:07:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09f/09f241272bbaae48e1473e18684bed76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Garrett Makes Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
