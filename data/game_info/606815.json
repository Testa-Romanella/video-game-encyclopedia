This is separate from the *stable playtest* release which launched on 05/15. The final release is expected on or around 07/15 (date very subject to change). All files for this project\u00a0will be hosted on google drive and subject to regular updates over the next 2 months.</p>\n<p>*This is <strong>hardcore mode</strong> for cutting-edge playtesting; there may errors in the text from time to time, stubbed out sections that are currently in progress, half-complete layout changes and a lot of incomplete artwork. But, if you want the most up-to-date copy at any given time to play with the latest alterations to the Children of Midnight game this is the project to follow*</p>\n<p>My in-house playtest group will be using this ruleset. Any online games you might find elsewhere are probably using the stable release @ https://balsamicmoongames.itch.io/children-of-midnight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T09:20:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61c/61c2b77b05587a8f7276da0783491949.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BalsamicMoonGames"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
