There is death and there are swords and spells to stove it off. What will you do when dark specters come for you tonight? Players find themselves in the role of a young woman who is being\u00a0trapped in her own nightmares. Can you find your way through the labyrinths of darkness, or will you be trapped forever?<br/><br/>Inspired by 90's hits like Hexen and Quake, Lichenvale is a first person hack and slash offering: fast-paced melee action mixed with the tactical use of spells and dashing around your enemies. This singleplayer title will feature a story mod with up to 10 maps full of various progressively difficult mobs, regional and main bosses, as well as some light puzzling. Those seeking an adventure are awaited in the New Game+ mode.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T12:56:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8be3920b5e5885fc31ccdc625146af6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["indorile"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
