{"id": 572232, "slug": "decode-2", "name": "Decode()", "name_original": "Decode()", "description": "<p>Short roguelike game created within 7 days for the 7DRL Game Jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Help a hacker astronaut reach the last room in a very dark spaceship to fulfill a special secret mission.</p>\n<p>--------------</p>\n<p>Current version: March 14th 2021. v0.2 -- Minor issues fixed.</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed Character Experience bugs.</li><li>Added music</li><li>Fixed some UI bugs.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Previous versions:</p>\n<p>March 13th 2021. v0.1 -- Initial version.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>--------------\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>What's it about?</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong>\u00a0Reach the last room before your space suit autonomy (your energy) runs out. Hack various computer terminals to obtain the access codes that allow you to open doors and advance.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use arrow keys to move.</li><li>Use keys h, i, o to interact with computers, elevators and doors.</li><li>Pay attention to the type of computer you hack as they hide access codes, upgrades and downgrades.</li></ul>\n<p>You lose energy when you move and every time you take a turn trying to hack a computer. When your attack misses (the computer's defense defeats your skills), you lose additional energy.</p>\n<p><em>Note : it is recommended to play on Full Screen mode.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>At some rare cases the character may get stuck in a hallway. If that happens, please press the \"Reset Character\" button as a temporary workaround.</li><li>At some rarer cases a code computer may spawn isolated (all the doors that allow the player to access it require said code), thus\u00a0making the player unable to reach the room the computer is in. This might require you to restart the game. I'm working on this issue at the moment.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Design,\u00a0Programming and base art\u00a0by Pamela Clunes.\r\n</li><li>Main character and computer's art by FreeCartoonClipart (https://www.clipartmax.com/)</li><li>Music in the background from https://www.FesliyanStudios.com</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T05:19:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba9/ba9a1dafe3d94d37c50b012f7012e068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pamela Clunes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
