Made for the 2021 Desert Bus For Hope Jam, and being a jam game, there isn't actually a ton of content, so you don't get a unique run every time so much as the same run is a little different each time.</p>\n<p>Use the number keys to select choices and progress through the game. If you're not familiar with the D&amp;D ability scores, google \"ability scores tomatoes\" and you'll find out, not that it matters much because the game is ironically quite short. Pay attention to the numbers at the bottom of the screen because it will not always be clear that they are changing simply by reading the flavortext, apologies about it being a jam game and all that.</p><p>Music and additional writing by Jarnatan, everything else by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:58:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea30dbbd36c99a37010bd74ad01c70a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["swordbean"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
