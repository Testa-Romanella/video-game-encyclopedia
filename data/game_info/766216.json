But, as she ventured deeper and deeper, she began to find that the shadows in the basement may have been more dangerous than she thought\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2013--------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Hiya! We\u2019re Team Juicebox and we\u2019re back with yet another game for this holiest of LD anniversaries. The biggest thing that we did differently for this jam was that we tried to coordinate an actual\u00a0<em>in-person LD</em>! All of our past games were coordinated (mostly) over Discord, so we were hoping an in-person jam would push our collaboration through the roof.\r\n</p>\n<p>In the end, this didn\u2019t\u00a0<em>entirely</em>\u00a0happen as expected given that one of us came down sick, two of us were recruited last minute and were unable to make it to the Home Base, and another two of us were missing for at least a day due to various other last-minute emergency occurrences. Luckily, we had a big enough team that we were still able to create a game! This game is a bit moodier and LOT more puzzle-y than the games we\u2019re used to working on, so while this was some new territory, we hope you still enjoy our game. And hey, feel free to leave a comment to tell us what you think!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T14:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dcd3e89b76ede224fbfa80c738eb7bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["johnfn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
