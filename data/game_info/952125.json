You can wishlist it here\n<br/><br/>\n\nStory:\nDr. Fetus\u2019 Mean Meat Machine takes place right after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever. After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There\u2019s just one problem: The DNA sample he\u2019s collected isn\u2019t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some\u2026less than perfect clones\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nBut fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he\u2019s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they\u2019re done\u2026who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it!\nAbout The Game:\nDr. Fetus` Mean Meat Machine provides the perfect combination of classic puzzle-gameplay and hardcore platforming elements that Super Meat Boy is known for.
