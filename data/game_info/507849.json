So when Amusement Park Land reveals its new ride, Tina and Lina sneak into the park to be the first to ride it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a kids\u2019 ride, and they\u2019re above the weight limit! As the ride starts looping around and around, it breaks from its foundation and starts toppling around the park. They will have to guide the ride safely to the park\u2019s exit without crashing into the walls as it constantly spins! Crash into the walls 3 times, and the ride will explode, and you\u2019ll have to start the level over!</p>\n<p>The ride never stops--You\u2019ll have to use the constantly spinning ride to your advantage when maneuvering through/around obstacles.</p>\n<p>16 levels of fun--Navigate your way through all 16 mazes of rough and tumble action!</p>\n<p>Simple to learn, challenging to master--when you finish the game, you will see how long it took. Try to beat your best time!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys or WASD move the ride</p>\n<p>SHIFT increases the speed - hold this to get through tight spots quickly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:16:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/47481321cee185e6570f7e36b1b1fa32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["YoukaiCountry"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
