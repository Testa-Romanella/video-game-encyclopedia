The goal is to find the other characters with the lightsource and damage them, while hiding the own character from the others. You can hide between NPC characters roaming around, who look similar to your character. If your character gets exposed it shows color. Hide again with using blackouts spawned at your light source. Beeing inside the own lightsource also heals your character. Be the last vampire standing and win against your friends.<br/></p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Alina Traun - Art<br/>Manoah Heinsch - Programming, Gamedesign<br/>Samuel Femb\u00f6ck - Programming, Gamedesign<br/>Thomas Hofer - Programming, Gamedesign, Music<br/>Tobias T\u00fcrk - Music<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T05:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8f23be735fecedddaebf2b523831409.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlowTom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
