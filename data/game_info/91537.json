How will he respond?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game currently has a single route with two different endings, but a second character's route was planned out. We potentially may be being adding it later at our own pace after the game jam has completed. And then maybe more characters!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAll art is done by Jia (@jia_ni_) and all writing and design is done by AM Cosmos (@acosmos).

The Mac version was created by a friend and has not been personally tested, so I can't vouch for its stability.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/328/3281d7abe79e97063a2c35420203b715.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["am cosmos"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
