In its present form, Power Lost would be aptly described as a \"micro game,\" as it tells a complete story, one that leaves the player wanting more.<br/></p>\n<p>To create the game, I used Unity 3D and several assets from the Unity Asset Store. Using found-art allowed me to focus on the atmosphere and story-telling aspects of the work.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong><br/>8/9/2019: Fixed some minor bugs and increased the player's look sensitivity. Thanks to\u00a0Raap QuSoLAris, I was also able to fix a type in Billy's dialogue. I also added a '0' button to the number panel and labeled the engineering bay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T07:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dcd894e6023dd78d491cfc365b171a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brain Jar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
