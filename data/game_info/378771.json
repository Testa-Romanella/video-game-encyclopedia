Who is he? What is he? Where does he come from? All he knows is that a portal is shining above him. Let\u2019s see where it goes!</em></p>\n<p>Slime Adventures is a rogue-like platformer we made while waiting around to graduate from engineering school. We wanted to make a game that would be just hard and skill-intensive enough to feel good about ourselves when we beat it, inspired largely by other awesome games like Hollow Knight and Dead Cells.</p>\n<p>There's only one stage at the moment, but if you guys like the game we'll\u00a0roll out more levels in the future while fine-tuning the gameplay. There's still a bunch of ideas we'd like to try.\u00a0Let us know what you think about it! (Even if you hated it; negative criticism &gt; silence, haha) We'd love to hear more feedback on how we can make our game better. You can reach us at\u00a0adventures.of.a.slime@gmail.com, or just comment on the page!</p>\n<p>We'll upload the build for macOS soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T03:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/371/371e1122a3794f05a5f3eda091722ec4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeaKyJar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
