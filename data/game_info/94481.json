Creating this was quite the journey, after having to scrap my first project at the end of day 1. I\u2019m glad I stuck to it, and despite lacking some polish and shine - I hope you enjoy your time playing Honest Dan\u2019s Trout.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p>- Scoreboards don't work on the WebGL version - I believe this is due to itch using https and the free scoreboard I'm using being on plain old http. It work's on the PC version though!</p>\n<p>- There is one known bug where the ball stops moving. It is rare, please excuse it if it happens.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e4480282d2c99abf30035d505c634e02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
