Cards are bought in the upgrade shop and you choose which tier of card you would like to spawn. After you have chosen a random card from that tier will appear and if you can afford it you can buy it! There is a last resort skill in the up grade shop that will kill all enemies if you are about to loose but beware it costs four thousand gold.<br/></p>\n<p>Enemies spawn faster and with more health the higher your score so you have to eventually sell the cheap cards in favor of buying the more expensive ones.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you too the very talented creators on itch for the models and sprites!</p>\n<p>https://brokenvector.itch.io/low-poly-tree-pack<br/>https://devilsworkshop.itch.io/low-poly-3d-and-pixel-2d-rpg-game-assets<br/>https://lordfitoi.itch.io/elementalis-skill</p>\n<p>Music\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://youtu.be/tKd6-lLcsRo</p>\n<p>SFX</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T05:04:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce60a6174258fe64c452ca9f5377ff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OiDavo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
