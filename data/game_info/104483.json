{"id": 104483, "slug": "eden-river-cardboard", "name": "Eden River Cardboard", "name_original": "Eden River Cardboard", "description": "<p>\r\n\tEden River Cardboard is a relaxation experience designed for Virtual Reality. This version was designed specifically for Mobile VR and is completely different from the PC version. It is the 5th game from Unello design. Eden River was created as a counterpoint to all the violent horror and action demos prevalent in VR. There is no blood in Eden River, there are no monsters. Instead you cruise down a tranquil river flying along with the animals of the forest. If you have one, set up a small electric fan blowing a slight breeze in your face. Eden River is a truly transcendental experience that is already in use in virtual reality research labs and special education classrooms around the world. The original score by Aaron Lemke was nominated for the Proto Award for Best Score.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a19/a19981249ac698e2722966585d32dee3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UnelloDesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
