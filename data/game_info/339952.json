{"id": 339952, "slug": "dead-to-rights-reckoning", "name": "Dead to Rights: Reckoning", "name_original": "Dead to Rights: Reckoning", "description": "<p>Dead to Rights: Reckoning returns to crime-infested Grant City, as an important informant is kidnapped on the eve of the investigation of a major crime lord. Anticipating the worst if the crime boss is not brought to justice, Jack Slate and his K-9 companion Shadow thrust themselves into hostile gang territory to save the informant and bring peace to the City. Dead to Rights: Reckoning expands upon the blistering action of the series with a robust ranged and melee fighting system that allows Jack to spit lead and bust heads with ease, and an all-new selection of weapons and lethal disarms. Players will also have unprecedented control of Shadow, utilizing him to watch Jack&#39;s back and unleash savage canine fury on lowlife thugs. For the first time in the series Dead to Rights: Reckoning allows players to go head to head through wireless multiplayer death matches, adding hours of replay value to an already extensive single player campaign.</p>", "metacritic": 54, "released": "2005-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-31T20:20:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d05/d056ba9586b79131c506ad80ef356abd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.12, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 4, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Rebellion"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Namco"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
