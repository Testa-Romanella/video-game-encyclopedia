The player can move one piece per turn, and the player may only move a piece to a particular place if there is a path (linked set of vertical and horizontal empty cells) between the current position of the piece and the desired destination. The goal is to remove pieces by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five pieces of the same colour (four in the early levels). If the player does manage to form a line of at least four/five pieces of the same colour, the pieces in those lines are removed, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another piece. If not, three new pieces are added, and the game continues until the board is full. <br/><br/>Pieces are moved by selecting a piece and dragging it to an empty square on the board. Alternatively, you can tap to select a piece and then tap on the target board square. Tap again on a selected piece to unselect.<br/><br/>There is an 'undo' button if you make a bad move and should you wish, you can even undo all the way back to the start of the game!<br/><br/>ARCADE MODE<br/><br/>This mode has special pieces and power ups that will help you complete the game:<br/><br/>\u2606 Timed Piece<br/>The Timed Piece has a counter that counts down each time the player takes a turn. The counter starts at nine and counts down to zero. When the counter reaches zero, the piece is turned to stone and can no longer be moved by the player.<br/><br/>\u2606 Multicolor Piece<br/>The Multicolour piece can be matched with any other colour piece on the board. Line up six pieces of the same colour to spawn a multicolour piece.<br/><br/>\u2606 Bomb Piece<br/>The bomb piece will clear a 3x3 area around it. Line up seven pieces of the same colour to spawn a bomb piece. Double tap to detonate.<br/><br/>\u2606 Destroyer Piece<br/>The destroyer piece destroys all pieces that match its colour. Line up eight pieces of the same colour to spawn a destroyer piece. Double tap to activate.<br/><br/>\u2606 Mega Bomb Piece<br/>This piece will clear a large area of the board. Line up nine pieces of the same colour to spawn a mega bomb piece.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0db975aa3006b1fc8fd11ed88c0bcda.jpg", "website": "http://meyume.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Meyume"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["MEYUME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
