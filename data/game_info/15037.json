Heck, I don&#39;t blame him &#39;cause there ain&#39;t no place like Hickston. But according to my map, we&#39;re gonna have to blast our way through jack o&#39; lope farms and a riverboat as well as a brothel (Bubba can&#39;t wait) &#39;fore we get home again.<br />\nToosday: Met new folks like Daisy Mae (she&#39;s purty). Bikers, pigs, cows and jack o&#39; lopes. I think I even saw the King at the Slurp n&#39; Burp.<br />\nWinsday: Yeehaw! Got to joyride in a Swamp Buggy and a motorcycle that were both armed to the teeth. I hope those peoples I ran over will be alrite. I still got a darn jack &#39;o lope stuck in the grill though.<br />\nThersday: New ways to destroy stuff! I found over 10 weapons like a crossbow that shoots dynamite-loaded chickens and a slingblade. Mmmm-Hmm!<br />\nFri-day: Sure am hungry! I just need some good ol&#39; redneck powerups like pork rinds, cow pies and some of my granpappy&#39;s moonshine!<br />\nSaterday: Boy I sure so like those toe tapping tunes by that good ol&#39; boy Mojo Nixon.<br />\nSunday: Heck! With all the new places we been, I sure wish my kinfolk could&#39;ve come along for the ride!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T13:37:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/247/2470c54279293399cb07cdf1fa720498.jpg", "website": "http://www.interplay.com", "rating": 3.77, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 55, "beaten": 19, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 18}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 34, "suggestions_count": 565, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 35, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xatrix Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Interplay Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
