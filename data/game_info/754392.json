The theme was \"Reconnection\" and we wanted to explore the connection between the moon and our waters through a simple fishing game. Our main goal was just to get an Animal Crossing style fishing system in by the end of the weekend. As per usual, we were a bit too ambitious with other elements and did not get everything completed within the time frame, so small fixes were made after the weekend (and much is still left unfinished).<br/></p>\n<p>Created by Erika Verkaaik and Benjamin Drury.</p>\r\n\u263d \u25ef \u263e\r\nAudio Credits:\r\n<ul><li>\"Patreon Goal Reward Loops - Track 05\" by Abstraction. </li><li>\"Lake ambience at dawn\" by juskiddink.</li><li>\"Soft wind\" by florianreichelt.</li><li>\"water on rocks, calm, manitoulin\" by TRP.</li><li>\"Water Splash Kitchen Sink\" by SiliconeSound.\u00a0 </li><li>\"Splash, Small, A\" by InspectorJ.</li><li>\"Water - Rain, ripples and brooks\" by Owl.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:38:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/421/42181e63f00f060ef6a995d7f98f5fda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Erika Verkaaik"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
