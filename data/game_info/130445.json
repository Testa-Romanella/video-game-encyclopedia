You can shoot in walk mode only , there are 3 modes walk, fly and roll. Your core temp will decrease if you enter water due to freezing. If enemy hits you your rage increases. 100% Rage will shut you down for 8 sec and 0 core temp will also shut you down and give opposite player 5 crystals bonus. So try not to freeze your self. Also note shooting tiles will decrease integrity of that tile, but be cautious as the spyder uses ice below you to shoot balls which also decreases integrity of tile below you!! Walking or rolling on broken tile will sink you in water and decrease your core temp.</p><p>Write to us</p><p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/createxion/</p><p>Twitter:https://twitter.com/CREATEXION</p><p>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/createxion/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/20761fc4788309f02c1980d70cc3eb13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CRE\u039bT\u039eXION OFFICIAL"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
