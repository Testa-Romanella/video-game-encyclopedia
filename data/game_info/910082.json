He's you but he didn't used to be.\u00a0 A mysterious illness is consuming the memories of those afflicted - and spreading like wildfire. You're just trying to save as many as you can before it consumes you with it.\u00a0<br/><br/>An epidemiological horror mystery game.\u00a0<br/><br/>**DISCLAIMER\u00a0MAYBE?**<br/>++++\u00a0 This game is super early access and in no way the full game. There's a lot that's unfinished, incomplete, or just left in as a placeholder.\u00a0Ive also never made a game before so bear with me - stuff might not work, stuff might break. Just let me know if something bad happens and I'll do my best to fix it!\u00a0<br/>++++ Currently there is no way to save - the game isn't super long in the current state\u00a0(maybe 20 minutes?) - but if you're really invested in finishing and something keeps breaking that prevents you from doing so, definitely let me know and I can teach you the super secret ways of skipping stuff.<br/>++++ A few of the screenshots are from future updates. Near future!\u00a0But not currently in the game - don't want anyone to feel like they were misled.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T07:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a27ca362d9570adbc2985754804262.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 336, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tim Oxton"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
