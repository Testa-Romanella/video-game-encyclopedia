My dad and I spent hours taking turns trying to flatten that cityscape and<br/>land the aeroplane.</p><p>The sheer joy we experienced when I eventually cleared the way to safely bring the aeroplane down to earth,<br/>to see the anonymous pilot emerge and wave in appreciation (or relief) of our persistence. Ah, how easily<br/> pleased we were back in those simpler times...</p><p>Back in the 20th century when I was obsessed with using a single button to play, Blitz was an obvious natural<br/>fit for experimentation, so I ran with it, adding a few new features to see what happened.</p><p>In Bombi, a damaged flying saucer's slowly drifting to Earth and in need of a landing strip.</p><p>But, hold on, there's a city in the way.</p><p>Perhaps unloading this cargo of bombs will keep the saucer in the air for longer...</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li>Press the <strong>space bar</strong> or the <strong>left-hand mouse button</strong> to drop a bomb (make sure the mouse pointer's<br/>over the game).</li><li>Press <strong>Esc</strong> to quit the game.</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>You start with only a single bomb, but with careful aiming you can change that...</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li>Hit the bomb in a building to get an extra bomb.</li><li>Hit the + in a building to get extra blast depth.</li><li>Hit the - in a building to get a forward-firing missile.</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>Three quick tips:</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li>Watch out for the very solid chunks of building that need four blasts to destroy.</li><li>Blow up the buses for bonuses.</li><li>Aim to earn at least one extra bomb as quickly as possible; then go for the bigger bangs (or the<br/>forward-firing missile if you need protection).</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>There aren't many variables to balance in the basic game, but it's still an effort to create a desirable feel: a<br/>sense of just being able to complete the objective. I don't believe I have hit that sweet spot though, mainly<br/>because I didn't stick to the superior, tighter VIC-20 proportions for my interpretation.</p><p>The proportions of the components and overall scale have quite an effect on play. I realised that when I<br/>replaced my VIC-20 with a C=64. I innocently expected to experience a superior version only to find it hadn't<br/>been scaled up to the larger screen and so felt too remote, too removed from play; that combined with the<br/>increased distance between aeroplane and city also made aiming harder at first. The cityscape was wider,<br/>with more buildings to destroy; at least the proportions meant that your breathing space was no worse<br/>than before.<br/></p><p>In Blitz the granularity of play is a coarse cell-based resolution. The aeroplane and bomb move through<br/>space one cell at a time rather over individual pixels. The bomb destroys buildings in chunks. This<br/>crudeness makes it easier to figure out if it's possible to destroy all the buildings in time (ultimately it's a<br/>simple matter of there being only so much space to go around). There are only so many cells available,<br/>so if you drop each bomb as quickly as possible and never miss, you should be able to land - and<br/>preferably with a margin for error.</p><p>I wanted a smoother experience overall but there are benefits to a cruder granularity, namely it's easier to<br/>appreciate the virtual space. In Bombi, the aeroplane and bomb move through the sky at a pixel resolution.<br/>I did the aeroplane constantly descending, but it felt better to change its altitude when it wraps around<br/>instead (by a cell).</p><p>To minimise the need for great precision, the bombs are always locked to the nearest cell (aligned to<br/>building the saucer's above) rather than falling at the exact pixel you release it. And they destroy only<br/>one cell of a building at a time, rather than the four or five in Blitz. The reason for this was to to give you<br/>room you to change, to evolve.</p><p>Additionally, the relationships between the following variables need to be considered:</p><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><li>The speed at which the aeroplane moves through the air: too fast makes aiming trickier and you<br/>get closer to the buildings faster; too slow and it takes forever to get anywhere and the drama is<br/>reduced.</li><li>How quickly or by how much the aeroplane descends: too fast can be too challenging; too long<br/>is too dull - not dramatic enough.</li><li>How quickly the bomb falls (effectively the frequency at which you can release bombs): too slow<br/>and you could end up with not enough time to clear the way; too fast and you can be too<br/> powerful.</li><li>The combined height (or area) of the buildings and how the individual building heights (are) are<br/>(is) distributed.</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p>Adding accessories such as extra bombs to drop, increased destructive power and forward-firing<br/>missiles only complicates matters. They need to worth taking a risk to collect, but if their effects are too<br/>powerful...</p><p>The friction necessary for good drama comes from the balance of comfort and discomfort, certainty and<br/> uncertainty: too much emphasis in one direction for too long can lead to less dramatic results; a slight<br/>teetering on the other hand can enrich the experience. The feeling that the odds are stacked against you<br/>but there is a chance to make the difference - and feel capable of meeting that challenge.</p><p>If the aeroplane's flying and descending too quickly, you have less time to react. If your agency is too<br/>heavily impaired, if you can't drop bombs quickly enough and their effect isn't big enough to make up for<br/>the reduction in time, you won't feel empowered enough to make a difference. \u2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07c/07c59e7fa9d8d1add0607cbe22e3991d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gary Penn"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
