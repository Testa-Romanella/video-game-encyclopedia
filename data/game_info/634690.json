This is a port of the Atari 2600 game, done in a day or so\u00a0while I get geared up for a second pass at Galaga. I think it'll be a nice game to play with my daughter on her TheC64.</p>\n<p>It's a testament to the skill of the original programmer David Crane, as what took a day on the C64 with its character graphics, hardware sprites and raster interrupts\u00a0would doubtless have taken several\u00a0months on the 2600. I've read and watched a lot about how to program the TIA and I still wouldn't really know where to start!</p>\n<p>-</p>\r\nThe Game\r\n<p>You have 136 seconds to get your chicken across the road as many times as possible. When there are less than 8 seconds left the scores will flash.</p>\n<p>There are various levels to play with different amounts and speeds of traffic, and two difficulty settings. On 'easy', being hit by a vehicle will only knock back your chicken a lane and a half. On 'hard', every hit returns your chicken to the start!\u00a0The difficulty can be set for each player to give an advantage to a child or lesser-skilled player.</p>\n<p>I've added a rudimentary AI as this was purely a 2-player game on the 2600.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is also a 9th level that isn't in the original game, featuring a maximum number of vehicles and wildly variable speeds.</p>\n<p>I admit the sounds aren't great, I used this program to generate random sounds and then tweaked them.\u00a0https://csdb.dk/release/?id=121491<br/><br/>If anyone can get closer to the frankly excellent horn and engine sounds from the 2600 version please get in touch!</p>\n<p>-</p>\r\nPre-game Controls\u00a0<p><strong>(Port 2 = left player, Port 1 = right player)</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Up/Down - select level number 1-9</li><li>Left - switch between easy (red) and hard (blue)</li><li>Right - switch between human or CPU second player (black = CPU)</li><li>Fire - start game</li></ul><p>-</p>\r\nIn-game Controls\r\n<ul><li>Up/Down - move chicken</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:00:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95ff6af6936ea4cb74ef4325005b4a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
