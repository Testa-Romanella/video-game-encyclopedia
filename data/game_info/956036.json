Every move will increase the heat faster than it will dissipate it. You move with WASD.</p>\n<p>Pressing tab will switch between world view and sonar view. In sonar view you'll have a Bearing Sonar view. To increase the distance you detect enemies on you press W while in Sonar view.</p>\n<p>At the moment everyone starts at the same place, there's no hinderance to the way you move or anything. Like I said, it's a VERY early alpha.</p>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T10:32:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d94b0912fd6a93ad70ef03cea6cf48f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Huginn Raven"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
