They are something different from you and something the same as you.<br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to <em>For Socks Need Not Feet, </em>a narrative role-playing game that utilizes sock puppets as its characters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Primary Mechanic</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Players have a pool of tokens (Stars, Moons, Hearts, and Clovers). If a player wishes to do something important to the story, the storyteller tells them which token it will cost. If the player pays that token, the action is successful. If the player does not pay that token, the action fails.</p>\n<p>Spent tokens are set aside and return to the player during a rest or refresh or at the beginning of a new session.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>If an action is particularly difficult, unique, or complex, the storyteller may ask for one of the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Additional Tokens: The player might spend up to 2 more tokens.</li><li>Rock &amp; Sock: The player might play a simple mini-game with a 50/50 chance of a win or loss.</li><li>Quips: The player might say something cool, smart, funny, or dramatic.</li></ul>\n<p>There are also a number of special tokens which allow players to ask questions of the storyteller, change their mind mid-action, interrupt the storyteller, and more. If you'd like to learn more, download the full rules.</p>\n<p><em>This is currently an incomplete project. The system is complete, but the main adventure is not.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T10:52:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834a8f5781db7d626f999f35cdb6e65f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jackrosetree"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
