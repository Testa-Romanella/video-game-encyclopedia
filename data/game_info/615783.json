Inspired by games like XCOM, Darkest Dungeon, and Divinity Origin Sin. As a gamer, I have always enjoyed DEEP RPG mechanics and the power of player choice!</p>\n<p>Combat is the key component of the game. I try my best to create a similar style of intensity and strategy like in XCOM, where you can feel the stakes at risk. In the same vain, I do my best to give you the tools necessary to defeat your unique enemies. Button mashing the attack command will not win you fights as you progress through the game. I have done my best to try and make each and every enemy you fight unique with its own attack pattern and abilities. I hope when you encounter enemies you feel a sense of excitement and dread. </p>\n<p>Row based combat similar to Darkest Dungeon.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The Armory of your home-base.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Story writing has never been a strong trait of mine, but I hope you find it interesting and wanting to learn more about the world, its characters, lore. As the combat makes you think, I also wanted the story to make you think. You will see the usual tropes but with clues and hints of something deeper.<br/></p>\n<p>The world is yours to explore... In pieces, the game is divided into regions, that you can explore at will (without leaving the region as a whole). I really wanted to make the game open world but its a huge task. There are things to discover and quest to complete, as well as foraging, mining, and cooking. Each region will have a main Mission that advances the game along with a \"Main quest\" that is as long as the \"Main Mission\". Here, I try to add interesting outcomes and dynamics I couldn't add to the main story.</p>\n<p>Finally, I add the donation button. I love making games, I remember designing my first board game at 11 years old. It's always been a passion of mine. I left the donation button there because I am a father and a Husband now. I can't put my gratitude into words if you decide to donate but just know that this adds truly legitimacy to the game and project as a whole. It would open up a whole new world of possibility for me and my family (at the very least my wife would be happy lol). Your support shows that maybe I wont have to work a day job some day, and that they like the games I create.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That's what it comes down too. I hope you enjoy this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T07:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a487a7e61e0c00cabc9d450d5fffa9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Artomes"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
