You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. <br/>Maybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. <br/>There are many different tools to choose from!<br/><br/><br/>You can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small \u2018teleporter lamp\u2019 and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! <br/>Much like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps.<br/><br/><br/>Choose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. <br/>It also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools!<br/><br/>Go and see for yourself what\u2019s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/00199022b2a019ba192bfc6320eb05c2.jpg", "website": "http://www.gaugepunk.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gaugepunk Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gaugepunk Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
