You make the decisions about what parts of the virus to study, which personnel to hire, and what equipment to purchase. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou\u2019ll soon discover you are working with an eccentric group of scientists who don\u2019t always work well together \u2014 and one very resourceful lab rat named Marvin. As the casualties increase, so does the stress and mistakes made, as you try to complete your vaccine before time runs out for all of mankind! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nInfection: Humanity's Last Gasp uses simple mechanics in a multitude of combinations to create engaging, deep gameplay as you try to eliminate an evolving virus that could spell the end of the human race. While random events from the Status Reports might throw a wrench in your plans (or occasionally help you out), you\u2019ll use the Lab Personnel and Equipment you\u2019ve hired to piece together randomly generated proteins into the different parts of a vaccine, all while managing dwindling funding resources as the Death Toll Track climbs. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach time that your Containment fails you come one step closer to losing this battle, so make sure that you push everyone to their limits before the infection reaches critical levels. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features 14 challenging viruses to cure as well as a custom game mode to play with optional game rules.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c716896e187137d83309066a144269b4.jpeg", "website": "https://www.hexwar.com/downloads/infection-humanitys-last-gasp/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 86}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 36, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["HexWar Games", "Criss Cross Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Casual"], "publishers": ["HexWar Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
