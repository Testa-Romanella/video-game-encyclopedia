Unfortunately, that doesn't translate easily into code, so I had to scrap some ideas like a shotgun and dynamic enemy bullet tracking fairly late in the jam. Still proud of the result, even if it is a tad unpolished :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T08:01:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e07/e074636d144054d6b9ef9fdab315999d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["/null/dev"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
