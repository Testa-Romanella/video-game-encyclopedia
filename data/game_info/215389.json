All puzzles and logic make sense to me but we'll see if it makes sense to anyone else)<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is my first Twine game, and also my first extensive use of Emojis, so behavior may differ greatly across platforms. This was created and tested with FireFox on Windows. It should work elsewhere but the visuals will completely change and some Emoji may not be supported or supported differently on other devices. If you see \ud83c\udffd skintone or \u2640 / \u2642\ufe0f emojis, They should be combined with the base emoji on their left.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Created in 48 hours.
