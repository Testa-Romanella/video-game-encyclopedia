I will investigate this.</li><li>[FIXED] When a human is grabbed and clicked again while in the giants hand it will vanish - possibly leaving the game in an unplayable state.</li></ul><p>You control a giant (he's called Frederick). Frederick is trying to save planets from destruction through mankind by throwing them from planet to planet.</p><p>Click planets to move to them, click humans to pick them up and click again to throw them upwards. Use your arrow keys or WASD to move around a given planet. WARNING: once humans land on a planet which isn't earth (you can't throw humans back to earth) they will start to breed!
