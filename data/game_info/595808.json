What lies at the bottom of this deep, dark trench?</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys, your pick. Should in theory also support an xbox controller, but it remains untested.</p>\n<p><strong>FISH VARIETIES</strong></p>\n<p>* <strong>Feesh </strong>- Rather stupid. Yellow in tint, move in one direction.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Foosh </strong>- The more aggressive Feesh. Blue in color. It follows divers, and hates when they get away.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Sploosh </strong>- Green fish, able to shoot algae projectiles. Likes their personal space, though. Use that to your advantage.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Gloosh </strong>- Glowing green fish. They are passive and don't want to make you drown, they just want to light the way.</p>\n<p>* <strong>Snark </strong>- Big meanies. Come in at high velocity, but your scuba gear is able to detect them shortly before they plow on through.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>*<strong> Skadoosh</strong> - ?????????</p>\n<p>* <strong>Kaboosh </strong>- ate too much taco bell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399f6ace269764cdd47b9a8c85ad6d27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["heckin_doggo", "nuclear_chair"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
