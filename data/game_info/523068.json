Come along for a spin!<br/><br/><br/>Every element of the game, from visuals to dialogue, has been carefully created to make you laugh, or cringe (whichever is more convenient at the time).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T03:14:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/261/2610c73c0b2c4e9b11d27767b1cdedb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2DG Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["2DG Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
