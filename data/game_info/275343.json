During the three months of development, we as a team have spent countless hours extensively researching French Polynesian and Tahitian\u00a0ecosystems, culture, and religion to bring the most accurate and respectful representation that we can. We hope that you as the players enjoy the experience in playing our game as much as we have in creating it.</p>\n<p>For comments, concerns, or bug reports, feel free to email us at\u00a0boatofsouls@gmail.com with your message.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93b53b5dc1936909637d48f68174ff37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BoatOfSouls"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
