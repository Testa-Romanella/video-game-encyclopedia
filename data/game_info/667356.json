These two things combined created GMooh (pronounced Jiii-Muuu), a big blob man who's always lived in darkness and is now trying to escape it!</p>\n<p>Currently there are no plans to update or finish the game, although this might change if there is a demand for it.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>PS: This game was initially targeted towards mobile gamers.
