Players control a little virus robot named MAL. Their goal is to make it to the Mainframe and destroy the system. Due to the systems defenses, MAL is dropped all the way to the lower levels. Now he must make his way to the top, no matter what. The gameplay for MAL involves jumping and dodging through obstacles while also using the robots special abilities. The special abilities include bouncing around the level with the Ball ability, sticking into walls, floors and ceilings using the Spear ability and navigating through tight obstacles using the glide ability.
