Sure you have played many arcade games but this one is not an average platformer game. You will find is easy and hard at the same time.\u00a0<br/><br/>Unlimited bullets, unlimited lives, but limited fuel. You can collect Coins, which are required to pass each and every level. You can collect Gems to play this game again and again.<br/>Every time you will play, about 20 Gems will get deducted. Every time your character dies and replay 20 gems are gone. So you have two choices, either play safe or keep collecting Gems and coins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9e/c9e17efab55f41668f8db531318b1c2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pixelgem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
