A fangame for the unlikely run 'n' jump series Giana Sisters, produced in Pixel Game Maker MV. This demo contains a single level for testing the waters and mechanics, and serves as a taste for what I would love to someday see to full fruition.<br/></p>\n<p>Features include:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>New Moves! Giana now has the ability to back flip to reach new heights and jump in rhythm to move faster and farther.</li><li>Remixed Powers! Giana's iconic abilities will return with a familiar form factor, now all as power-ups to find within the stages.</li><li>Gem Bank! Collect as many gems as you can without dying to store them in a bank for use in the world map. (note: world map not yet implemented)</li></ul>\n<p>My eventual hope is to make this a story about Giana and her oft-forgotten sister Maria. To go along that would be to make Maria fully playable, with her own unique take on the controls, and an option for co-op play.<br/><br/>This is what I've been able to complete on my own. If you have any feedback, or even potentially want to join this dream project, don't hesitate to contact me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T09:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbc/bbc45bd2a9e731f7c397489dfb86c600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MizunoKetsuban"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
