The assignment was to create a <em>MarioKart</em> inspired racing game. <em>Race To Xanadu </em>was the second 3D game demo I've built. 3D modeling and texturing was my biggest challenge for this game since I recently learned to use Maya at a very basic level. I applied to The New York Film Academy in 2016 and have been working to build up my skills and knowledge to become a game designer. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22bb3bca500b744e81767f5afc1a02ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Angelica Anatra"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
