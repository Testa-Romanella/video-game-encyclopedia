Welcome to the Bee Simulator where you go along trying to pollinate flowers. It's only 5 levels so far but I'm looking to expand. You will need a computer to play due to the use of arrow keys. I am going to continue working on this to add more levels and possible add mobile controls for it. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T11:28:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/581032d4f38c2c4a4d485f929c15d0d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["meginthevalley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
