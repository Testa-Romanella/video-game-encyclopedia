For more cost of the other two combined!! There\u2019s no reason to pay for this!!! Especially if you\u2019ve already bought Ball Toss Deluxe!!!!<br/></p>\n<p>I can\u2019t stress this enough, you should not buy this version. If you want Red, Green, and Yellow you can get them for free in Ball Toss. You can pay less and get Blue in Ball Toss Deluxe. The only thing you get here is the ability to switch between all four colors in the same app. That\u2019s not worth it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please tell me you didn\u2019t pay for this and Ball Toss Deluxe</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T07:10:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e27/e27f485a0cb7536562a52f229c798121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["EGFAB Technology"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
