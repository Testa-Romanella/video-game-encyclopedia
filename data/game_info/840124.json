Unfortunately, without cohesive or consistent implementation processes for sex education, a highly diverse\u00a0\u201cpatchwork\u201d of sex education laws and practices exist in the United States. In response to these issues, our team decided to make a\u00a0scenario-based video game to teach incoming college freshmen about common situations that may happen at a college party, and the best\u00a0ways to handle those situations. \u2018Survive the Party\u2019 is a scenario-based experiential learning game where learners play as a ghost that is\u00a0haunting a college party. The ghost floats around the party and \u2018overhears\u2019 various conversations between individuals of different\u00a0backgrounds, genders, and sexual identities. At certain points in each scenario, the ghost can step in and make decisions about how the\u00a0scenario should play out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c7a1d1c41897fa317be56e718d6093f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["songsong8"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
