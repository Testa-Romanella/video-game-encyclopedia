You&#39;ve had a hard day and the last thing you need is this: shopping. Luckily, the place is pretty empty and you&#39;re progressing rapidly.

The initial idea was: How do I make a game with only one turn interesting? Give it lots of endings--in fact there are many &#39;endings&#39; and (hopefully) every sensible action results in an &#39;ending&#39;. There is no winning action. There is however more going on than just this and the more endings you see the more things should become clear.&quot; [The Z-Files Catalogue]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1999-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-09T05:41:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/489/489b26e8f89b8305dc6029a3f88ac068.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Barlow"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
