You must collect the fuel tanks to power your propulsion unit to decrease your rotation speed so that you can see better what's in front of you. Why? Because you have to catch the oxygen tanks before it runs out. On top of that you need to evade the incoming asteroids of course!<br/>Tilt your phone to move to the sides and press anywhere on the screen to slow down your rotation.<br/>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T07:09:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bff58ec941cbfe65ac8aa34715f547bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jalmeida1994"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
