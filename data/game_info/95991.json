Squirrely Roo Rabbit, who is unaffected due to her not being a traditional animal, teams up with an outcast chameleon, Cammy, to track down Leon, the Chameleon king, and return the forest to normal. The animals she meets along the way will help Squirrely Roo if she feeds them fruit matching the color they\u2019ve become. Because fruit only naturally grows in red, blue, and yellow\u2014and animals come in green, purple, and orange as well\u2014Cammy must use her chameleon color-mix ability to solve puzzles and fight. These first two levels of chapter one follow Squirrely Roo and Cammy\u2019s encounters in the forest with characters such as the Chameleon Grunts, the Big Oink, and Granny as they make their way to Leon.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Squirrely Roo Rabbit</em> began in Fall 2016 as a senior thesis project by Boba Studios at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4ad061d124bc4f5c288a44d27c1aa07a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Boba Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
