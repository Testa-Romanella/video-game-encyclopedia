Rock out to amazing chiptune ragtime music! See if you can make it through all 96 rooms!<br/><br/>It's a puzzle game that's maybe a little different! You can run around, jump, and pick up &amp; throw various things you may find in the room. When you throw something, it flies around the room and bounces off the walls until it hits the ground. It's fun to just hang out sometimes and keep throwing stuff around!<br/><br/>You can pick up marbles and throw them around the room. If three marbles of the same color line up, they flash and disappear! Sometimes you want that to happen. Sometimes you don't. It's part of life to learn what you want!<br/><br/>You can pick up and throw critters as well. They can't hurt you, and you can't hurt them. If the mood strikes, you can stand on top of them and ride around. Maybe they can help you reach new places!<br/><br/>Featuring 12 worlds with 8 rooms each, for 96 rooms total. The 12 worlds are divided into 3 episodes of 4 worlds each. The worlds in each episode can be tackled in any order.<br/><br/>So what awaits in these worlds?<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Sky High Keep</strong>: Home to floating Platforms and flying fish. Why are the fish flying? Why not?<br/></li><li><strong>Tabby Catacombs</strong>: These spooky crypts feature the Drop Bolts, which fall down as you stand on them, as well as the Bass Knobs, which fall slower than the bolts but retract faster. You may also find the Anti-Bolts and Treble Knobs, which rise up when you stand on them!<br/></li><li><strong>Woods of Hermia</strong>: Here come the Rocket Blocks! When you stand on them, they move left or right; after you jump off of them, they move back to their original position.<br/></li><li><strong>Titania Capitol</strong>: The Diamond and Heart Blocks will allow you to super-jump and double jump if you jump off of them.<br/></li><li><strong>Equinox Isle</strong>: The Bubble Pots will continuously create bubbles that you can jump on. But be careful! You can\u2019t stand on them for long!<br/></li><li><strong>Temple of Helena</strong>: You\u2019re going to love this! The Magi Blocks appear &amp; disappear at set intervals. Also, there are flying pigs!<br/></li><li><strong>Mercurial Mines</strong>: In the mines, you\u2019ll find Arrow Zingers, which will Zing thrown marbles and critters in all sorts of different directions.<br/></li><li><strong>Hazy Shade Land</strong>: This frozen world has the Elevators, which activate as long as you\u2019re standing on them, and stop otherwise. Also, it has everyone\u2019s favorite: Ice Blocks you can slip on!</li></ul><br/>Plus, there\u2019s 4 more worlds that mix &amp; match all these things to give you a nice finale!<br/><br/>Oh, and I almost forgot: the POWERUPS!<br/><br/><ul><li>The <strong>Keys</strong> will cause the Door Blocks to open.<br/></li><li>The <strong>Mushrooms</strong> will cause the Invisible (hollow) Blocks to appear.<br/></li><li>The <strong>Music Notes</strong> will cause all marbles of the same color to flash and disappear.<br/></li><li>The <strong>Gems</strong> will turn all marbles of the same color in Metal Balls, which don\u2019t match with anything.<br/></li><li>\u2026Except for the <strong>Metal Gem</strong>, which will turn all Metal Balls into Wildcard Marbles, which match with all colors!<br/></li><li>The <strong>Book</strong> reverses gravity for Betsy, so you can run on the ceiling!<br/></li><li>The <strong>Magnets</strong> change gravity for the marbles, so they will fall in different directions!</li></ul><br/>And the <strong>Carrots</strong>!
