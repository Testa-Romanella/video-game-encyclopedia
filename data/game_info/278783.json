This is also the first game I have ever made, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have a blast making this or that I didn't learn a lot about Clickteam Fusion. I feel the concept has some merit, but my skills were unable to follow through, hopefully I can remake it in the future sometime. This game jam and this game have definitely ignited my game-making hobby and I plan to continue to and improve by participating in more jams and making more games that are hopefully better than this.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/2213a1295046cbe6cc68e5ba6ef1cb7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jomiak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
