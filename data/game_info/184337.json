One player controls Fun, a positive bacteria dancing to make cells happy, while the other player controls Gus, working to share his depressive mood.</p>\n<p>Players infect cells by successfully completing a rhythm game. The players can infect neutral cells, or convert enemy cells, which is harder to accomplish. The game has three distinct phases: in the first phase, players navigate a scripted battlefield; in the second phase, new cells spawn to mix things up; and in the third and final phase, the neutral cells disappear, forcing players to attack enemy cells. Once the timer runs out, the score and the winner are revealed.</p>\n<p>P.S. - This is a serious game based on special scientific research</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c80afeaa44a59b8faf0e0b226183f897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fungus Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
