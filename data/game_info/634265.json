This game took a lot of effort to create because balancing the levels was very tricky and making them unique took some creativity. I got inspired to create this game from playing the Ketchapp mobile game \"Knife Hit\" which contains a lot\u00a0of similar game mechanics.\u00a0The game is \"finished\" but I could easily create some more levels but each level takes a lot of time to build and balance. For a\u00a0beginner this really feels like a complete game and I feel proud to share this work publicly after working on it for roughly 9 or 10 hours total. Thanks again to everyone who participated in this jam with me and played my game.\u00a0I would love any kind of feedback or ratings\u00a0in relation to this project!</p>\r\nUpdate Notes\r\n<p>v2.0 - In Development\r\n</p>\n<p>Developed In Unity 2020.3.11f1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:17:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82c/82c3e8d0112dcee34cfe85ee356e263e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mitchell Todd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
