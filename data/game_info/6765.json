It&amp;#39;s up to you to lead them to safety by placing tiles and power ups in their way. <br/><br/>It has 72 levels split across three distinctive worlds, where players must simultaneously save the Hairys from falling off the edge of the world by re-arranging the tiles on each level, while acquiring power ups, magic mushrooms and destroying evil enemy Kikimoras and their three powerful end bosses.<br/><br/>Follow us for the latest info and game news!<br/><br/>\u2022 http://crescentmoongames.com/other-games/<br/>\u2022 http://facebook.com/crescentmoongames<br/>\u2022 http://twitter.com/cm_games", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba6/ba611bd24b0f052b2b3d3edfeed03c55.jpeg", "website": "http://crescentmoongames.com/other-games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Crescent Moon Games", "Arges Systems"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Crescent Moon Games", "Forest Moon Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
