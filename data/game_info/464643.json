Use the side menu to construct buildings on any of your tiles, but be careful, once placed, buildings can't be destroyed! Each tile of land and each building adds weight to your island, so build balloon buildings to counteract the weight.\u00a0</p><p>If your island is too heavy, you will see it start to drop on the meter on the right. Don't hit the ocean below! If your island is too light, the meter will start to rise. Build more buildings or more balloons to keep yourself neutrally buoyant.\u00a0</p><p>Mines add coin over time at the cost of a tile. Coin is used to build buildings. Power plants add energy, which is needed to fire projectiles.</p>\n<p>Weapons can be used to destroy enemy (or your own) tiles and buildings. Movement buildings can give you some control over the shifting currents. <br/>Use harpoons to latch on to another island, allowing you to expand. Be careful of your weight! A large island can cause your island to rapidly drop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T05:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f36415bdc02870b0dbe99334193f0b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InjuredNinja"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
