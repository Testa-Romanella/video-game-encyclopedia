Be sure to pick them up to give your powerups a boost!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you go deeper into the universe throughout levels, more powerups will help you, but more comets will appear, and faster.<br/>\r\nGood luck trying to beat the game!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMusic by Ethan \"ethanpiedude\" Pesikoff, Mark \"marchimedes\" Trautner, Andy \"KeyboardFire\" Tockman, and Matthew \"matthewpipie\" Giordano.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLike our facebook! https://www.facebook.com/ExocometsGame<br/>\r\nFollow our twitter! https://twitter.com/ExocometsGame", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/511/511ab34f224e74ca38c6205714151620.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/ExocometsGame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Giordano"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Matthew Giordano"], "esrb_rating": null}
