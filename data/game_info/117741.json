Each mini game is, essentially, a mini first person shooter with aesthetic nods and gameplay references to classic Nintendo games.</p><p>Your guide in this world is the handy JOB the JOBOT, who guides you from level to level with a bedside manner that can only be described as GLaDOS-esque. Will the AI's wit be a match for you, the Let's Player, and your engaging and definitely not scripted content?</p><p>The four mini-games featured within Now You're Let's Playing With Power are:</p><ul><li><strong>Shot The Duck Up</strong> (Duck Hunt)</li><li><strong>The Maria Sisters </strong>(Mario Bros)</li><li><strong>Mootroid </strong>(Metroids)</li><li><strong>The Legendary Zoldo</strong> (Legend of Zelda)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, we didn't get enough time to write and record the Let's Players side of things, so for now you'll just have to enjoy 4 mini-games. Very much playable, but a little rough around the edges.</p><p>For those of you without a Vive, I recorded a play-through for you.<br/></p><p>Made by:</p><p>Me - Programming and Design</p><p>Tim Hutton - Writing and Design</p><p>Cassie Selin - 2D Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693e519e1c208fbcc1f1a35a6cff8b29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lewcart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
