Here is\u00a0 our game : We decided to call it Time Scale, because that is the very mechanic that we didnt managed to implement.</p>\n<p>Aaaaand also because it's a collision between two era; the space traveller crash himself in a strange city, on a arsh desert planet, it's look like they were in the middle of the bronze era... But they are all gone.</p>\n<p>We of course, did not had the time to do everything we wanted to do, but we still manage to pull up with something we all can be proud of.</p>\n<p>Before you can start, here are the controls:</p>\n<p>Z,Q,S,D or the key arrows : movement.</p>\n<p>Clic or ctrl on a net activate the grab. (very useful, but it's quite bugged... sorry, just use the Echap button to respawn and try to not moving when using the grab.)</p>\n<p>you can grab some cristal, with the left clic or the E key.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you will like it!</p>\n<p>&lt;3 <br/></p>\n\n<p>Credits to Hippolyte Desfonds, Mathieu Demany, Augustin Liglet and Hugo Wehrl\u00e9<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c31c368c7bb78e4166a09c7e0b4d9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eschyles"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
