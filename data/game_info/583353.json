The squirrel mafia, *stay with me*, decides to take advantage of this and begins to use your land as tree farms for their acorns. To push them back, you must weaponize your pickles and take back your farm.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You cannot jump in I.E.P and instead must propel yourself with your pickle bombs. This forces you to plan your movement and predict the trajectory of your launch to avoid dangerous spikes and squirrel thugs.\r\n</p>\n<p>Skill points make an appearance and are used to upgrade Gregory based on your needs. Feeling slow? Upgrade your speed ability. Feeling vertically challenged? Buy the Pickle Boots.\r\n</p>\n<p>Play through 15 unique levels, and perfect your pickle launching abilities. But watch out\u2026 you\u2019ve been making a mess for the squirrel mafia\u2019s leader, and he\u2019s not too happy about it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:39:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/49f/49f53f285cdf7fa5be845fe145eb9bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fitimus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
