Don't ask me why my file size is so big because I've been troubleshooting that for hours and have no answer. Maybe it's just an Unreal Engine thing. Anyhoo,\u00a0 here's what you need to know:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>It's spooky but not gory or anything</li><li>Move with WASD, interact with M1 and M2, combine with MiddleMouse or C</li><li>You can also jump but there's not much point to it</li><li>I spent most of my dev time developing the look and basic \"feel\" of the game. This means there will be a lot of mechanical bugs and half-finished aspects. For example, you can't actually lose as it is now. Maybe if it didn't take me eleven years to get it onto itch.io I could have fixed more bugs lol</li><li>I'll come back to this project and really polish it\u00a0\u00a0 once the jam is over</li></ul>\n<p>***DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS***</p>\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with multi-volume file compression as I was just a few blissful hours ago, you might be confused by the fact I have two files uploaded for the same version of the game. You'll have to download them both. Then, you can use a program like 7zip to extract the file that's NOT marked 002.\u00a0 It might even be marked 001. :) Your extraction software should figure out the two files are related and take it from there. If you actually put yourself through all that to play this humble game jam submission from a total amateur who had to cut corners way too often for a week-long jam, you have my deepest gratitude.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T00:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/4610505c3e593bc48c4495dc1d756558.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghost Cat Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
