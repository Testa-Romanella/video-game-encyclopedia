Experience first-hand all that being a pro-racer has to offer by grabbing the wheel and throwing your car around in five different racing modes.</p>\n<p>Hone your skills in practice mode, go head-to-head against the clock to win the Time Trial or go it alone in Singles Races. As you and your times improve, why not rack up professional points in Career Mode or race against the best in Championship Mode.</p>\n<p>Racing this hard comes at a price though. Cars take a serious battering and frequently need patching up in the Repair Shop. Negotiate with hard-nosed sponsors to keep the money rolling in for your team and to purchase upgrades that improve your performance.</p>\n<p>In Stock Car Speedway it\u2019s not just the cars that take a battering.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-21T23:39:16", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["System 3", "Play It"], "esrb_rating": null}
