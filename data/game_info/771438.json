There are currently <strong>3</strong> classes (Goliath, Cultist, and Priest) to choose from, each with unique playstyles and items only they can use!</p>\n<p>Matches can have up to 4 players. Players are split into groups of two in the beginning of the game and explore the dungeon to look for the other two players. Once players have found each other, their next goal is to escape! The exit will spawn randomly in the dungeon, and it's up to the now fully reunited Gang to find it and escape together. Survive the dangers of the dungeon or be met with death.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: Due to the lack of servers or a reliable way to connect over the internet, in order to play multiplayer, port-forwarding or a service like Hamachi is required for over-the-internet connections. In the future we'll be looking into other ways to simplify this process but unfortunately that's just how it is at the moment. We apologize for the inconvenience.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Another Note: This game is in Beta. While we've tried to eliminate most bugs before release, there may still be some bugs left in there that we've yet to take note of.
