You're a simple block, and your goal is to get the highest score possible. The game is obviously very simple, and that's the point. Space is to jump, and each jump has the same distance, so half the game is learning how to time and then planning ahead! You can't just wing this game, no matter how simple it is. Have fun, and comment your score on this game's page if you want! Space is to jump!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1e7f60476dccdf664b0d0e35eefb76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FrenchieDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
