Spend your days however you want - there's no end goal or time limit; forage, fish, mine, or grow crops for money - or maybe hit up the coin slots in travelling fairs or casinos in search of that jackpot.<br/><br/>What's all that money for? How about purchasing additional farmland - in multiple countries! Build houses, barns, and crafting stations to maximize profit, or to give you more room to decorate. Craft your perfect farm with furniture, d\u00e9cor, and garden objects.<br/><br/>And when your house is just right, maybe it's time to go out into the world and find the perfect partner to help call it 'home'. But who needs romance when you have a heaping handful of friends? Loneliness is a thing of the past when you can schedule dinner parties or get togethers to liven things up.<br/><br/>Reel Life strives to be a relaxing, comfortable, and rewarding gameplay experience \u2013 no matter the feature you choose to focus on.<br/><br/><strong>Our goal for Reel Life is to provide a relaxing point-and-click farming sim experience that can be played in short or long bursts.
