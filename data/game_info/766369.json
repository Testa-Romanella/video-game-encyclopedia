The player spawns on a watch tower with some equipment to stop fires. Fires are spreading quickly, so you have to be fast. But there is no winning, you can only delay the inevitable!

Items that can be used to extinguish fires are marked in red.Buckets can be picked up [E] and filled with water at water barrels [E]. Buckets with water inside can be spilled [LMB/Space]. While filling a bucket, you can hold [E] to fill more water into the bucket. The more water is inside, the more fire will be extinguished. The amount of water in the bucket can be seen in the bottom left corner.<br/>Fire extinguishers can be picked up with [E] and used by holding [LMB/Space]. Fire extinguishers have a limited capacity, which can be seen in the bottom left corner. This item does not respawn and only a limited quantity is available on the map.<br/>Flares can be picked up with [E] and thrown with [LMB/Space]. Flares will emit smoke which will cause a plane to spawn and drop a large amount of water/foam above the flare. Only 3 flares are available on the map so dont use them all at once.<br/>\r\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<p>Download and extract the zip-file,\u00a0that's all.
