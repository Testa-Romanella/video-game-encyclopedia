Sadly, at the last stretch while I was implementing the last (and biggest) level, all of my files corrupted.</p>\n<p>This is a dev build compiled one day before the jam ended that has some bugs, dev-cheats (like how you start with 7 coins - should have started with 0 in the final release), temporary graphics and other quirks, to show off the work that I put into the game. This is not indicative of the final product I was working towards, but I hope you enjoy the game as it is anyways. \u2764\ufe0f</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Art and programming: Erik Bianco</p>\n<p>Music tracks: Ezequiel Palladino, Santy Noguera, AstralTempest</p>\n<p>Special thanks: VioletJayke</p>\n<p>*Created for the Extra Credits Game Jam\u2074 in less than 100 hours.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb9/bb9bf0b06fc9de2920fd5649b66c1536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erik Bianco"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
