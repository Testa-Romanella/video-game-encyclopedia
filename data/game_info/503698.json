From the four corners, various vehicles will enter the streets. Your goal is to take out as many as possible by crashing into them or using other means. Ramming other vehicles from behind will minimize your own damage. Try not to wreck your own car!</p>\n<p>Additionally you have to maintain your rowdiness, so you have to drive full laps every now and then. The timer in the middle indicates how much time is left for you to complete the next round. Don't miss a round or it's game over.</p>\n<p>Destroyed cars will sometimes drop Power-Ups which you can collect to heal or gain special moves.</p>\r\nAssets and Resources\r\n<p>All assets and resources have been created ourselves - with one exception being the fonts (LEMON/MILK\u00a0and\u00a0COMIC KINGS\u00a0).</p>\r\nPost Jam\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The original Jam version is still available as a download below.<br/></p><p><strong>[Bugfix Oct. 7th 2020]</strong>: Fixed a very rare bug where the clamp that removes broken down cars would freeze in the scene if the car got deleted during its animation.
