{"id": 371683, "slug": "goblin-siege", "name": "Goblin Siege", "name_original": "Goblin Siege", "description": "<p>Goblin siege is a simple game in a medieval European setting in which the player is challenged via an equation in the form of an assembly of opposing goblins (right side of the equals sign), and needs to try to create a state of balance with their own army of knights (left side of the equals sign) throughout a series of increasingly challenging levels. As the game progresses, the goblin army becomes more complex and shifts more rapidly in order to confuse the player. If the player is able to achieve equilibrium for a sufficient length of time, the goblins are considered defeated and they retreat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T10:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74c/74c0d561926e84ed14f1bfe0bad8c995.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Purple Muffin Productions"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
