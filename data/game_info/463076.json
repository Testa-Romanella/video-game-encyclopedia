Its a short, stressful, top-down shooting game which pits your cyborg-like character against five waves of enemies, followed by a sixth wave with a simple but challenging boss fight. Due to the length of the game, death is permanent and will reset you.</p>\n<p>There are hints available on the main menu, and i recommend you read them. Criticism is welcome, although i will not be expanding upon this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>ALL art is my own, produced in aseprite, and the simple sound tracks are my own too. The sounds are taken from freesound.org.</p>\n<p>Thank you for viewing the page, even if you didnt download it!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Antivirus may try and stop your game from launching due to it being completely unknown, I can assure you its just a unity build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:37:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63e/63e01d0e0ae8f0f5584aa8865baab13e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tbage"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
