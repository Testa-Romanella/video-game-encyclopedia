The theme of\u00a0the jam was Dual Purpose. With Splatoon as an inspiration we decided to create a game where 2\u00a0players have to race to the end of a level. Every time either player jumps both players will\u00a0switch to a different color. There's a twist though, you can only see objects that have the same\u00a0color as you!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In this game 2 players race to the end of a random preset-generated level. The first one to reach\u00a0the end wins. As stated above your color will decide which objects you can see and which will be\u00a0invisible. Along the way you can use your ability to randomize the colors on the other player's\u00a0field to try to distract or kill them. First to the end is victorious!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Player 1 Movement</li><li>Arrows - Player 2 Movement</li><li>R - Restart (New level)</li><li>G - Disable graphics :c</li></ul>\n<p>Any player can press their down button to activate their ability (randomize other player's\u00a0colors).</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming/SFX: Martijn Polderman (mpolder)</p>\n<p>Pixel art: Jacen Wyatt (HappySlapp)</p>\n<p>Soundtrack: James Wilkinson (Overkillius)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0f/b0ff2ba5e397f541aff9dce1500ab4fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mpolder", "HappySlapp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
