This was a solo project where I challenged myself to make everything in the game except for the audio files. I originally wanted to create four puzzles, but only had time to include two in this version of the game. I may continue working on this and put the remaining puzzles into the game at a future date.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T09:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/885/8853f1da374301ce8c159f1ae1eee968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gmcarlheid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
