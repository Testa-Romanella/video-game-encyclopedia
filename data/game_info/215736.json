{"id": 215736, "slug": "southbound", "name": "Southbound (itch)", "name_original": "Southbound (itch)", "description": "<p>Similar to an endless runner, you control the goose from a birds-eye view as you try to avoid obstacles in a looping level as you escape the looming threat of winter behind you. You start as a solitary goose, but on the way you can pick up friends that fill up your gaggle, effectively giving you more hits that you can tolerate from your environment and increasing your movement speed. If you get hit, you loose a goose, speed and finally, your life. You can move in eight directions while trying to avoid obstacles. The player can also use winds that appear randomly around the sky for a boost, however, watch out for winds that will take you for a spin, making you dizzy and inverting your controls for a short while. Try to survive as long as you can, but winter takes us all in the end. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f5/7f51536b21920e6d046aaf97bea83f5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RushMaverick"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
