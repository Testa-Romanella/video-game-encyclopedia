Inspired by the art style of Limbo, I set about making a volleyball game for the undead, obviously. This fairly simple idea was mostly picked due to the tight time constraints but also because it lent itself well to weaker CPUs. The final game ran on Windows, Android, and iOS.\r\n</p>\n<p>Whilst fairly primitive, this project includes some of my earliest attempts at procedural animation and hand-coded physics simulation.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> - Navigate menus / move player</li>\n<li><strong>Space</strong> - Execute active menu option / serve</li>\n<li><strong>Escape</strong> - Open menu</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db1036a18939ba04f3ec7903cb1cc7d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Never Rest Studio"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
