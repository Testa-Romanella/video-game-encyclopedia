Foiled by an army of foolish mortal soldiers sent by the nearby kingdom, to finally steal all of your well earned treasure, you have been a reigning Lich for centuries, now only reduced to a head. Little do these soldiers know that you can still defend your hoard of loot. Fry these fools with your magic and keep as much treasure as you can before they get it out of your castle!\"</p>\n<p>Morphic here, had a lot of fun making this game, hope you enjoy it! In total this took around 36 hours to put together, only known bug currently is you can still move the targeting reticle and change animations in the pause menu, but I\u00a0can't get that fixed for the life of me.</p>\n<p>Source Code on GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/MorphicGames/Riches-for-Liches</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T06:28:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f531dfbcede8934d3c9a24fd402b112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MorphicGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
