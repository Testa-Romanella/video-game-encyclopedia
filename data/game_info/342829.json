I admit that it is\u00a0the ugliest possible colour scheme but it works thematically.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the three buttons?</strong> Press the red button to stop or go. You must be stopped to change colour. Press the green button to get greener and the\u00a0brownish olive green to get browner.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it match the <em>One More Time</em> theme?</strong> Whether you get eaten or\u00a0succeed in avoiding the snake, the game starts over again, forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is it so hard? </strong>A regrettable lack of forgiveness mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>Is it even possible?</strong> Yes. I have uploaded a video just to prove it can hypothetically be beaten.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:06:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fde6b2c45af78fc82b037105ef117397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["H.H.Magoo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
