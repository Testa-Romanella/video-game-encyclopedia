PF is a combination of an RPG and an old-school FPS. The basic idea of the game is different from everything I've done so far and in fact from any other games I know, the player is, in my concept, just a pawn in a game played by others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world I am creating for this game is derived from the medieval tarot, the Rider Waite version. There are paradoxical worlds, in opposition, I am even thinking of giving up chromatics for the negative doubles of my worlds. Basically, I have created the chaotic universe in which the player doubts the integrity of his own self. You will be alone in a world that you do not understand, and that you do not control.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In general, the levels are a combination of technology and the Middle Ages, magic really only exists at the hypothetical level.</p>\n<p>The key of this game is that you can't really make decisions and you don't realize this, the rules of the game change from one level (tarot card) to another depending on the whims of the gods</p>\n<p>This is the first demo, it's a very large file (7GB), I intend to update it periodically<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T03:43:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a0/9a08956dcd655be306ab3089e2594207.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 214, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misstret"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
