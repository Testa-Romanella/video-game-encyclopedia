Watch how the combination of a neural network and a genetic algorithm can enable your creatures to \"learn\" and improve at their given tasks all on their own.<br/></p>\n<p>The tasks include running, jumping and climbing. Can you build the <em>ultimate creature </em>that is good at all of the tasks?</p>\n<p>Created by\u00a0@keiwando</p>\n<p>For an extensive explanation on how everything works click on the \"?\" button in the creature building scene (<strong>I highly recommend everybody to read it</strong>).</p>\n<p>Note that this is a simulation and not a game. There are no real objectives. Even if a creature of yours reaches 100% fitness, you don't win anything except for (hopefully) lots of excitement and joy.</p>\n<p>Here's a video with some great creature designs by KeiraR that you can use as inspiration for your own creatures:\u00a0</p>\n<p>I created a collection of gifs\u00a0of user created creatures over on my website.
