{"id": 18979, "slug": "bionite-origins", "name": "Bionite: Origins", "name_original": "Bionite: Origins", "description": "Over 6 years in development, BIONITE: Origins is the first in a series of games set in the future of mankind. The mysterious element called \u201cBionite\u201d is accidentally found on Venus by a crew of prospectors looking for deposits of Helium3. They soon learn that Bionite has a very unique quality that has laid dormant for thousands of years.  In order to extract the Bionite a massive mining operation is built on Venus.  As the result of a minor disagreement with the military, a group of scientists are banished from Earth and form their own faction dedicated to stopping the military.  Because of its nefarious uses by the military and the spread of mining facilities throughout the galaxy, the Rebel Faction has dedicated itself to stopping all Bionite production. Players can participate in battles on the Military Side (IMI) or for the Rebel Faction. Sniping an enemy vehicle for infiltrating the enemy base is a great way to launch a sneak attack\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game includes 3 maps; The Emze Mine (located on Venus), Biodome 24 (located on Mars), and Hadley\u2019s Hope (located on the Moon). This release is a single player version against the computer which includes Skirmish Mode. The fully developed turn based missions are currently in development and will be released with the Full Version.  It is also intended to introduce gamers to the complex command system used in the game. There is a learning curve for Bionite: Origins and requires some time to develop the skills necessary to lead a successful campaign against the enemy.  We like to think of the game as \u201cChess on Steroids\u201d. It requires players to understand how to develop successful military strategies while relying on vehicle-driving skills to win and advance in rank.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/500/500ce3d51c8c03dd812bcca9bf75713b.jpg", "website": "http://www.bionitegame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Platoon Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Platoon Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
