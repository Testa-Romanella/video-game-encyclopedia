I started working on it back in 2011 and released it in 2012, after being inspired by such OG english otome visual novels such as \"Fantasia: the realm of Thanos\",\u00a0\"Frozen Essence\" and \"Re:Alistair+\"\u00a0.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The game\u00a0took me way too long to finish, taking a 6 months break at one point, and making another short visual novel in the mean time, but I did it\u00a0. My art was pretty bad. The story, while I still like parts of it, wasn't the most\u00a0original. But I still stand by my characters though, because to me at least,\u00a0they knew they were stereotypes and self-inserts, but they had fun with it\u00a0and never took themselves too seriously. The drama is cheesy as all hell, but there is some innocence to it, reflecting my younger self.<br/><br/><em>Summer found me again</em> is an update to SFM. The sprites have been redone for a couple of years, so at least now they'll be put to good use. I wanted to do this remake for a while, now thanks to the quarantine I am able to deliver.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The UI was redone twice, technology was upgraded\u00a0(that old mobile phone sprite tho) and much of the dialogue\u00a0was tweaked. The plot is basically untouched though. Whether\u00a0you're a new reader or an SFM veteran, I hope you enjoy this cheesy little story about high school flings and other inconsequential things.</strong></p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p><strong>There are still things to tweak, so if you find any mistakes, please let me know. There are no CGs in the game, but if there is enough interest in this release, I might make some. Some epilogues are planned as well.\u00a0The game is free, just like the original, but your donations are very much appreciated!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T04:38:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fee/fee49e3efd33bed8d6cf8d5735722452.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Selavi Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
