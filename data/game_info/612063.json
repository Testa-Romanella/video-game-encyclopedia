{"id": 612063, "slug": "crawl-space-abenthy", "name": "Crawl Space (Abenthy)", "name_original": "Crawl Space (Abenthy)", "description": "<p>Crawl Space is a dark modern take on the top-down stealth genre set in an alien space station, inspired by 80\u2019s horror and sci-fi films. This time, you get to play as the monster. A monster that can burrow into the bodies of others and control them.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve escaped your test tube and it\u2019s time to exact revenge on the crew of the space station. Navigate its four levels and assassinate your targets. But be careful, this monster is scary because it is clever, not strong. If crewmembers spot you, they\u2019ll try to kill you as well. Learn to blend into the environment, crawling under desks and shelves, into vents or the backs of crewmembers to avoid getting spotted. Hide the corpses of crewmembers so that they won\u2019t be discovered \u2014 if they are, murder the living as they mourn.</p>\n<p>The full game takes about 15-30 minutes to complete and isn\u2019t recommended for children or anyone sensitive to flashing lights.</p>\n<p>Crawl Space was made by Team 9 over the course of seven weeks using the Unity engine. All team members are students at Futuregames in Stockholm.</p>\n<p>3D\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Design\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Music</p>\n<p>Abenthy Lilliestr\u00f6m\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Aldo Sartori\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Teodore Huldt</p>\n<p>Isaac Olander\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Alexander Johansson</p>\n<p>Rebecka N\u00e4sberg\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jonas Holmlund</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T06:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b42606011c3b247e5b6f542a8d0f0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Abenthy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
