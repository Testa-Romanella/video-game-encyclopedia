Did I mention this was for PC and Mac? Well, it's for PC and Mac. Okay what else... oh, there's a controller_layout.png included, you're gonna need that too. This is a student project, I hate to keep emphasizing that but if you were expecting Kingdom Hearts 3 well... this is actually much better than that but with less heartless. I will revisit this game and it's core concepts one day but a lot of you were looking forward to this so here ya go, sorry to get your hopes up! But fighting the little red dudes is fun I will say that much.</p>\n<p>Alright, later!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T02:42:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d9579256a5b28b863a180aa4fa52c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["adieloart"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
