Karel can use this effect in order to pass obstacles in his way and to bring objects from the past to help him progress in the present.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Created as a semestral project at university. It serves as a prototype of our vision, on which we'll be working on in the future.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Game Designer, Programmer</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0</em>Honza Szlauer:\u00a0https://twitter.com/bearinyourheart<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>Programmer </strong>-\u00a0</em>Anton\u00edn Hol\u00edk: <strong>\u00a0</strong>https://twitter.com/TondaFSCZ</p>\n<p><strong><em>Graphics</em>\u00a0</strong>-\u00a0Lucie Tvarohov\u00e1:\u00a0https://twitter.com/LucyTvar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84a/84ab0ddec85d04ab5b7b9cebb240b539.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TondaFS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
