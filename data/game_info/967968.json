Man-made environmental disasters have ravaged our biosphere. Artificial consciousness has been created, subsequently murdered, and then strictly outlawed at a global level. Megacorporate colonies and research stations dot the solar system from Venus to Jupiter. Quantum computing has radically altered the digital landscape and the very meaning of privacy and digital security. <br/><br/>The game's threaded stories originate from both inside and outside your team -- weaving together threads from your hired mercenaries, criminal connections and history that just won\u2019t die. These stories operate on three interconnected and at times overlapping levels -- personal stories (your team), contact stories (your employers) and event stories (city-wide). <br/><br/>And every choice you make and mission you run will impact your character's permanent Traits, changing them in both subtle and big ways. Their stories and your choices combine to create a unique narrative for every game, every Knight and every team. <br/><br/><br/>Trese Brothers Games makes deep, highly-replayable strategy games &amp; RPGs. This is our ninth and highest production-value game yet.<br/><br/>The second game our studio created almost 10 years ago, Cyber Knights RPG, took hundreds of thousands of gamers on a gritty cyberpunk roller-coaster, trying to get rich or go down shooting. That classic Cyber Knights has always had a huge following within our community and we are excited to come back to the world and stories we started creating there so many years ago with an all new game, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint.<br/><br/>We\u2019re weaving together the genre\u2019s classic themes with the unique setting and history of Cyber Knights to create some of the most cutting, gripping and human stories we\u2019ve ever told. Betrayal, sacrifice, trading away humanity for an advantage, living fast and dying young, revenge and testing the bonds of friendship and trust -- it's all here under the New Boston dome.<h3>Wishlist now:</h3>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T04:32:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97b/97b5763708d9ab27c00c9bd870cee66f.jpg", "website": "http://www.tresebrothers.com/cyberknights.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 489, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Trese Brothers"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Trese Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
