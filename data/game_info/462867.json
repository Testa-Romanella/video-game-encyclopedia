To defend and get rid of your opponent, you can use your trusty pool noodle to slash at the enemy and possibly knock them into one of the two trap cages in the battlefield. These cages, if touched, temporarily trap the player for a few seconds, leaving the other player time to go capture the person's floatie. After they dissapear, \u00a0they take a few seconds to respawn so don't think you're safe! That's it! Capture the opponents floatie and rise to victory!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Player 1 (Left Side):</p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD\u00a0</strong>to move and jump.</li><li><strong>C</strong> to attack with your noodle</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 (Right Side):</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Arrow Keys </strong>to move and jump.</li><li><strong>M</strong> to attack with your noodle\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>FlamingSparrow(me) - <strong>Programmer</strong></p>\n<p>Cookedpatato - <strong>Artist<br/></strong></p>\n<p>FoxHyode - <strong>Musician</strong></p>\n<p>Dev Note: This was my first multiplayer game as well as the first fighting game I've ever made, and I think, considering that, this game turned out pretty well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T02:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d36c160a8d56c7ac1a6779ea776d535.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["FoxHyode", "FlamingSparrow", "The nush"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
