Use your flight to not fall completely and die on the blades at the end of the tunnel. But your flight consumes energy and if the energy runs out you can no longer fly, and consequently you die on the blades below.</p>\n<p>Fortunately your energy is rechargeable, but only when you collect the blue energy that appears only when the marker is white. You must keep stacking energy to fill your bar.</p>\n<p>There is a marker that changes from white to red every 10 seconds and vice versa. If it's red, the game's traps appear, if it's white, there are no dangers and energy balls appear to fill your energy. Then you can keep flying.</p>\n<p>There is a Meters of Height counter where you must reach a specific height to finish the level, but it hasn't been implemented yet. So for now you can see how many points you can score.</p>\n<p>----------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD or arrows.</p>\n<p>P to pause</p>\n<p>X to fly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T16:05:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/22579f9d4e56aa697901af9b0e4e70af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LincolnSalles"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
