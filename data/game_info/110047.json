The owner and bartender of the place itself is a tall, muscular man, tattooed head to town and covered with piercings. But one month, the bartender notices a rather modest looking woman coming in almost every night doing nothing but ordering a glass of water. Intrigued, the bartender can no longer go on in silence at the odd sight and talks to the woman.</p><p>{NOTES: I wrote, drew, edited, and coded everything with the help of Ren'Py. The music is by Emilie Autumn which I have permission from the artist's manager to use this song, as long as it's not for profit.}</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a11/a1112123523d449fbfe4c4bd1d3e37e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["CSR"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
