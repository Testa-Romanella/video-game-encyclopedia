Guiseppe sure doesn't, and he inherited the title!</p>\n<p>One day, Mrs. Willikins, the oldest resident of his town, chokes on one of Guiseppe's muffins and he's under suspicion of murder. His friend on the force, Heathcroft, tells him to hide away on his great-great-grandfather's estate, but there's just one problem: the place is cursed. Having no knowledge of what's in store for him, Guiseppe goes to Drury Lane to start a new bakery as Heathcroft tries to clear the baker's name. Things soon start going very awry once Guiseppe manages to follow exactly one recipe in an old recipe book he finds in the kitchen, which leads to the summoning of an eldritch horror known as Cup'holgrath.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is approximately 1 1/2 hours if you speed through and collect all of the important items, and possibly 2+ hours if you interact with every object and find every little bit of lore.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T05:50:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93e/93e2452e8574556a72e26fbadae95a99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sith_Winchester"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
