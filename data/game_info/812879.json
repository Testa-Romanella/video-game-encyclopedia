That moment is the only memory she has.\u00a0Even with her high school crush, Lee Kang Dae, by her side to help reconnect with old friends, she is frustrated with her inability to remember anything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the help of reading the journal she had left behind, Ju Ri hopes she will be able to find herself through the pages of that which she had written. Maybe it holds the key to that final day\u2014why she was out in the pouring rain in the first place, why Kang Dae only brings her nervous feelings and nothing else, and most of all\u2026 why the cold Do Jun Su, whom she had written to have been mean to her has been the only person to trigger any memory fragments.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>- About -</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Memories I Had Written</em> was an entry I wrote for the Makestar Web Drama competition back in 2018. It didn't win, but that is OK, I got to keep my story and have decided to finally share it. This was actually a concept I've had for awhile and wanted to make into a visual novel, but it never panned out. When a friend of mine made me aware of this contest, I decided to try this idea in a K-Drama context, and, it really fit the format.<br/></p>\n<p>Since the contest was to make an original webdrama, each episode chapter is purposely written fairly short. They do very in length, but again, are kept consistently short. There's 8 episodes in all, although due to time constraints I did have to scope back a little, so I plan to extend the final episode to flesh things out.</p>\n<p>I will be periodically releasing each episode, hopefully every week, since it's all been written out. I do warn you, the writing can feel a little cheesy, but I'm happy I was finally able to get this concept that was stuck in my head out into words in some form. And hey, if it's popular enough, maybe I will convert it into a visual novel someday!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Currently 2 episodes are available to read!
