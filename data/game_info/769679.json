While in the air ducts you have the chance of choosing three difficulties of floors. The higher the difficulty, the more treasure there is. BUT WATCH OUT! It wouldn't be that easy.</p>\n<p>For no genuine reason the Job satisfaction in the Museum is perfect and because of that, it holds an endless supply of guards to monitor each floor. You, the thief, have to evade their eyes, steal the treasure, and get out of there before they catch you and throw you into the next building: The Endless Jail.</p>\n<p>With you is a handy dandy gadget called the \"Inviso-wind\". While temporary with each floor, it allows you to hide in thin air, making you escape the guard's watchful eyes.</p>\n<p>Can you earn as much riches as possible without getting caught? Well, then you better get into the Endless Museum!</p>\n\n<p>(Little message from the creator: I hope you get to enjoy the game even in its very early form. There are a ton of areas that need improvement from Gameplay to UI, AI and Accessibility, and even the store page!\u00a0Any comments on things that can be improved on would be greatly appreciated!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:02:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/def/defc00623a7aae1cb66fe9c18ec59135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["taycomedia"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
