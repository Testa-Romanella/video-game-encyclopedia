Like a real-life combat commander, sneak in and take out terrorists and terrorist leaders in a zone that is not managed by multiple countries to complete the mission.</p>\n<p>The game operates from a very different perspective than traditional shooters, instead of being a team member who personally charges into battle, the player commands three special operations team members who work with each other and use multiple means to get into tight spaces and minimise their own casualties. The gameplay is also different from traditional RTS games, using line drawing and keyboard manipulation to change the team's route and view angle in combat. The key to the game is to spot and destroy enemies from the shadows of the battlefield, while defending yourself from enemy attacks from the shadows. A number of support items such as grenades and flashing lights can be used to aid the attack, and doors and windows along the attack route can be interacted with in a number of ways. With these systems in place, players can use a variety of strategies to eliminate enemies and clear out rooms to complete their missions perfectly.</p>\n<p>Ready to Fire will be released on PC this August, so make sure you add the game to your wish list.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/437/437d8285a211c89cafa5de6164525e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gnt007484"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
