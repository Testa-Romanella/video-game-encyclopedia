The basic move of this game is horizontally or vertically swapping the positions of two adjacent marbles, to create sets of three (or more) marbles of the same color and type. Try to score as many points as you can before the marbles randomly cover the whole play area. Just wait-there is a twist as the middle row can move only horizontally and the rest of the rows only vertically. So, you have to adjust the marbles in such a way that three or more sets of the same marble type lie in the central box to eliminate them and thus score points.<br/><br/>Features include :-<br/><br/>* Awesome gameplay <br/>* Clean UI  <br/>* Nice music and sound effects <br/>* Cool animations<br/>* No IAP, free and much more....<br/><br/>Use your strategic skills to match 3 or more colored marbles and have fun....", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f42/f429048ed5dc7426f934038aeef5d123_Dnex00o.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Priti Kaloni"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Priti Kaloni"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
