But don't count them out just yet - with your help, they'll fight to climb the ranks and become the ultimate 5-star idols! <br/><br/>Choose from three thrilling game modes as you strive to reach the top. But be warned: the competition is fierce and the stakes are high. You'll need to quickly feed weaker idol units to your own to level up and reach a coveted 5-star rating. But if you're not careful, you could end up as level fodder yourself! <br/><br/>The world of this fictional mobile gacha game is not for the faint of heart. It's a cutthroat place where only the highest star idols will survive. Do you have what it takes to lead Flow, Macho, and Jade to their dream in this GachaHell?<h3>Credits</h3> <br/><strong>Nickireda</strong> - Game Director, Programmer, Designer <br/><strong>BobberWCC</strong> - Lead Artist, Animations, Marketing Material <br/><strong>MapleJava</strong> - UI Design/Developer, Additional Art <br/><strong>Princess Sylvysprit</strong> - Music, Additional SFX <br/><strong>Kobayashi\u2019s Ego</strong> - Video Editing, Trailer <br/><strong>DariusSheeno</strong> - Video Optimization <br/><strong>Seth_Windam</strong> - Ideation/Concept <br/><strong>Grunku</strong> - Logo", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T04:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1dab6bf1bf8df037207a3dbb82efafa9.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/GachaHellGame", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nickireda", "BobberWCC"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nickireda"], "esrb_rating": null}
