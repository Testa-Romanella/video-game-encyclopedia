Each player should not see the other part of the screen, so you might need a book or plate to play this game. You should also prepare a mic that would work before the game starts because it would affect the\u00a0obstacles.</p>\n<p>Just follow the instructions and find out what to do during your work time, then maybe you could have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:34:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3ba560f324461b041e85581fbba34cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas boh wang"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
