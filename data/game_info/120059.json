Avoid car crashes and pesky jaywalkers. Try to get all 7 xkcd-inspired endings!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls: </strong><strong>Arrow keys</strong> or <strong>WASD</strong> to toggle lights. <strong>R</strong> to refresh.\u00a0<strong>P </strong>to pause. <strong>H</strong> for help.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with Godot Engine and Blender in 3 days. Sprites and UI done in Photoshop. Didn't have time for sound or music, I'm afraid.<br/></p>\n<p>Little backstory: MacOS and Unity pretty much pushed their updates onto me right before the jam.\u00a0I was stuck fixing crashes, and like the persevering person I am, I decided to drop it all and learn Godot on the dot while doing the jam. So yeah, here's the first game I've ever officially released, for the first game jam I've ever done, made with an engine I've never heard of 3 days ago. Go easy on me ;)<br/></p>\n<p>Entry for the first ever xkcd\u00a0Game Jam.\r\nBased on\u00a0Traffic Lights:\u00a0https://xkcd.com/1116.\u00a0Thanks to Randall for xkcd and @XavierEkkel for hosting the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6de/6dedc7575f905f8c7aed6b3ff3b13447.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gastric Sparrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
