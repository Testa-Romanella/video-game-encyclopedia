We can play it on touch screen and mouse. Click on the screen where you want to the next bubble to shoot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I know, the players who love the skilled shooting to places would like maybe more challenges. My partner wanted a chill out game where puzzle is the key component and skill is when you bounce the ball off the walls.</p>\n<p>I will\u00a0be making changes to the game based on feedback. Let me know when you find bugs, hopes or anything at all :]</p>\n<p>I am working for the second version with power ups and far on the horizon is a two player battle championships league. All donations are going to building the second version and ultimately the league.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I can not yet promise what it's going to be and will there be anything. I am also validating the game play based on popularity and traffic it gets. Please, share it with your friends and know-maybes when you like it.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n<p>- Flutterby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:49:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/845/845c8d2efb6068a713e0dc968f2f8ffc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["flutterby"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
