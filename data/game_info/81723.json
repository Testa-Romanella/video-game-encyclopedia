The goal is to score as many points as possible by dropping a ball and landing in the scoring areas.  Every peg hit on the way down provides 20 points, and depending on which scoring area the ball ends in, a bonus of 0 to 10,000 points is added.<br/><br/>Along the way there are 6 special pegs, called Power Pegs.  These Power Pegs have special powers attached to them.  It is with these pegs that high scores are won and lost.  The Power Pegs special abilities are Double Score, Half Score, Bonus Points, Lose Points, Gain an Extra Ball, Lose an Extra Ball.<br/><br/>Try your best to get to the top of the global high score board.<br/><br/>Power Pegs keeps track of all your gameplay stats and as you play you can unlock achievements.  Do you have what it takes to unlock all the achievements?<br/><br/>Power Pegs also auto-saves after each completed drop, so if you are in the middle of a game when a phone call comes in, don't be afraid to answer it.  Your game will be saved and you can pick up where you left off.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa7/aa73639ed9b0813273c16742e26eb29c.jpg", "website": "http://www.1026development.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["1026 Development"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Jeremy Curcio"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
