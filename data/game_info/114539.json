Revolted by this, a brave Goblin goes out on a mission to steal the gold back as the Human Kingdom is strong and they could never fight back, but the Goblin needed a good plan as to how to steal the gold from the humans' guarded and/or fortified cities. After having a sandwich stolen by a mole while trying to think of some plan, it struck him: dig underground to get beneath the banks in which the humans had stored the stolen gold. And so the Goblin will have to find a way through the dangerous and unknown underground to get the gold back!  </p><p>This game was originally made for a college project and after some positive feedback we decided to continue developing it. The original idea for the game was made using <strong><em>Orteil's Game Idea Generator</em> </strong>which generated \"a strategy game in which you extract ores from cities for glory\". We decided to make the \"strategy\" part more meta and so during the game you have to make a <em>strategy</em> to avoid obstacles and such.</p><p>Dirty Thief has been in development(#madewithunity) for over a year now and we plan on adding a lot more features.</p><p><strong><em>Contact</em></strong>: for any questions or bug reports please contact us at <strong><em>dirtythiefdev@gmail.com</em></strong> or <strong><em>@dirtythiefdev</em></strong> or http://dirtythiefgame.tumblr.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c103f715796c4bbfe45968aac489305.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MvP Studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
