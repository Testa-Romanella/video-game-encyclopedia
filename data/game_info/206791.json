In total 3 hours spent on the effects stack (and still not happy with the result) and 2 on the unfinished game. <br/><br/>I might revisit this idea again in future or do another 'what if' retro 3D game on in GB style.<br/><br/>No lives, no collisions, no proper player character, no enemies, no shooting and no point?  You can just wonder how I planned on doing the enemy sprites and having them visible among all the outlined trees and horizon :)<br/><br/>WASD or direction keys to control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e409e4062e6a1d01cd74b9ab140ab88d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sparkes"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
