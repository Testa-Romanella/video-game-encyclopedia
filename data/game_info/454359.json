Uploads do not guarantee quality nor performance.</p>\n\n<p>With your planet on the brink of a new ice age, the doves call upon their greatest warrior to look for a new habitat. The mission comes to a dramatic halt when you crash land on a foreign planet where you discover a power... that could change the universe.</p>\n<p>Legend of Lubi is the crazy attempt of a team trying to mix the silly into a serious whole. The lighthearted tone of steampunk spacebirds is offset by the dramatic plot that will see your species extinct if no action is taken.</p>\n<p>Furthermore this project showcases the groundworks of\u00a0Physics2dx, a system that allows to switch between 2D and 3D physics on a dime. This presented a great number of opportunities and challenges that this project only just skims the surface of!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The project teems with experimentation and personal growth and we hope it speaks to the average player as well.</p>\n\n<p>Bente: additional chiptune music<br/>Casey: Gameplay programmer and Physics 2dx architect<br/>Cindy: UI architect and visualizer<br/>Kai: Character modeling and rigging<br/>Marijke: Story and level planner<br/>Pauli: Music and sound effects adaptationist<br/>Simone: Environment artist and visualizer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77f/77ff6e27bdb15e3ff5cac01ff3a53737.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CaseyDeCoder"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
