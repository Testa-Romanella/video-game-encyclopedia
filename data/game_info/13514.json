The original prototype of game got various awards and creators decided to create and release a full-version of the game. <br />\nIn this game, players have to move their pencil-drawn character who can run and jump through various hazardous environments. There is an ability to freely rotate the entire game world, like changing floors into walls and every level of the game is built with that having in mind. Also, the spinning of the game world has an effect on the main character as well as the world - walls can become flat, or walkable surfaces may move or react to the change of gravity.
