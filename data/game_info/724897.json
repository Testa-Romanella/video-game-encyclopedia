Each of the seven races, embroiled in conflict born of pride and racial arrogance lost thousands to the nights of endless battle. The Four Kingdoms were built on the backs of the fallen. But even after the battlegrounds were covered with mortar and stone the animosity remained. The seven races each went their separate ways, finding compromise in their distance from one another. After countless years of war, it seemed as if civilization would take root. We hoped for a new era of knowledge and understanding. Yet despite all our progress\u2026\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>A single life\u2026\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>A single breath\u2026\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>A single thought\u2026\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>...Would destroy everything.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Beyond the Savage Deep - The Unofficial Roleplay Guide</strong> is a fan made Savage Worlds sourcebook based on the world of \"Beyond the Western Deep\" (created by Alex Kain and Rachel Bennett). It is a world filled with warring anthropomorphic races during an uneasy peacetime. They fight for control of a medieval low-fantasy land. Sprawling green fields, forests that extend up into the clouds, and bustling desert districts at the base of a monkish tower.</p>\n<p>Inside you will find</p>\n<ul><li>7 New Races based on the races of the webcomic,</li><li>7 New Enemies,</li><li>14 New Edges,</li><li>1 New Hindrance,</li><li>Guides to The Four Kingdoms and its denizens.</li><li>A set of new weapons to play around with,</li><li>And rules for \"Weapon Oils and Poisons\" providing your players ways to buff their weapons and debuff their enemies!</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<strong>Note:</strong><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is an old project I had started years ago a little before Savage Worlds Adventure Edition was released. That said there is DNA from both Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition and SWADE in here.\u00a0It was something I chipped away at every now and then until I eventually forgot about it. Cue January 2022 where I found it on an old hard drive and thought it best to release it publicly. I've been sitting on it for so long and felt it would do better out in the wild for someone else to look at and pick apart. Somethings to take note:<br/><br/><strong>1.</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is not an official product. I have no relation to the creators and owners of Beyond the Western Deep. Outside of a brief chat where they okayed the use of the comic's imagery in this document, they have not signed off on this nor do they endorse the RPG. Do not let this work reflect on their comic nor its quality. This is simply the work of a fan of the property and its creators. I cannot state enough to check out the official comic here:\u00a0https://www.westerndeep.net/\u00a0Support the official release. Its good stuff! So good I thought it would be fun to make an RPG based on it.<br/><strong>2.</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is kind of \"released as is\". You'll find there are things missing from this document. Some races are missing flavor text and information, most of the\u00a0world locations are absent of information. Sunsgrove was the location that received the most love. At the time I was reading the comic it was the location with the most information.\u00a0<br/><strong>3.</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0You will also find a lot of my developer notes still attached to the document. Commentary I left to myself and the playtesters. It was an idea I stole from the Burning Wheel books, which had developer commentary within the actual print itself. Nothing bad I assure you, just notes where I excuse or explain content in my <br/>own words.<br/><br/>Regardless I had of fun working on this, my first real sourcebook for an RPG. I hope you find enjoyment in it as much as I did. ~ Kam/Void", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T08:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f16/f16dc27900c1006bb7bf3930cb8ca9f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Void"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
