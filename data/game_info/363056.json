Carve, ollie, grab, grind, and spray folklore beasts to progress through 100 unique challenges. <br/><br/>The rules are simple:<br/>Carve to the left of red gates.<br/>Carve to the right of blue gates.<br/>Don't run into stuff.<br/>Send it deep.<br/><br/>The art, sound, and code was created in Colorado and outdoors whenever possible. This project kept me sane during a skateboarding injury in 2018 and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T18:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d417588c28c0eb4eaf94cf94ed8c2a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Julian Tucker", "Side Hit Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Sports"], "publishers": ["Julian Tucker", "Side Hit Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
