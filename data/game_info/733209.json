Besides being a huntress she didn't really like to hunt for fun, she only killed any type of animal if needed.\u00a0\r\nWith the greed of the people rapidly growing, and with the food resources running lower and lower people were getting tired of eating just bread and water, so what we can call an animal slaughter began and people all over the kingdom started hunting more and more, which made Erin extremly mad, since the wildlife was one of the most important things to her.\r\nWith all of this happening Erin started hunting the people instead of the animals, until the point she gained the title of the \"Huntress of Hunters\".\r\nBesides being hated by a lot of people, its not doubt that she is one of the best Archers in the kingdom which caught the attention of the King when building this Squad!\r\nErin is a medium range defense, but with high attack speed! She is a really good ally to have in the backlines besides not being the one that does more damage, her other stats really make up for it!\r\n\r\nNormal:\r\n<p>Cost: 250</p>\n<p>Attack: 30</p>\n<p>Projectile Speed: 10</p>\n<p>Range: 3\r\n</p>\n<p>Attack Speed: 1.5</p>\n<p>Area Damage: No\r\n</p>\n\r\nUpgraded:\r\n<p>Cost: 250</p>\n<p>Attack: 40</p>\n<p>Projectile Speed: 10\r\n</p>\n<p>Range: 3\r\n</p>\n<p>Attack Speed: 2.1</p>\n<p>Area Damage: No\r\n</p>\n\r\nMeet Zox the Mage!\r\n\r\nSince he was born he was always a very curious child with the thirst to learn about everything, needless to say that his curiousity ended up being extremlly benefecial to him, learning how to read perfectly at the age of 4, Zox is considered\u00a0 a prodigy all over the Ashtra, besides being born in a poor family that did not have access to any type of knowledge, Zox used to sneak at the middle of the night into the Kingdom Library.\r\nBeing extremly close to the earth gave Zox an affinity with the Earth element, which ended up being his magic affinity.\u00a0 Zox is known for his earth powers and the capacity to do things that people consider impossible, such as flying!\r\nBesides being one of the most powerfull humans known on Argon, his lifestyle had its downsides, he is extremly shy and anti-social.\r\nBesides that with a lot of talk and convincing the King was able to make Zox join the squad, but whenever its possible he still prefers to use his power to make sure he is high enough so he doesn't have to talk with anyone else.\r\nZox is the most powerfull tower curently in the game, but also the most expensive one, he is an incredible range, AOE damage, and for sure hits hard!\r\n\r\nNormal:\r\n\r\n<p>Cost: 1000</p>\n<p>Attack: 50</p>\n<p>Projectile Speed: 3</p>\n<p>Range: 5</p>\n<p>Attack Speed: 1</p>\n<p>Area Damage: Yes, 1 Explosion Radius</p>\n\r\nUpgraded:\r\n\r\n<p>Cost: 500</p>\n<p>Attack: 60</p>\n<p>Projectile Speed: 3\r\n</p>\n<p>Range: 7</p>\n<p>Attack Speed: 1.2</p>\n<p>Area Damage: Yes, 1.2 Explosion Radius</p>\n\r\nMeet our enemies!\r\n<p>Besides having a lot of enemies planned for Dungeon Below, currently we only have one enemy which is the fearsome Wolf!</p>\r\nThe Wolf\r\n\r\nWith the opening of the dungeon doors, giant animals starting to crawl from the caves!
