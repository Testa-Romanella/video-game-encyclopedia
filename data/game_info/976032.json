In fact, it is one of the most difficult games on Steam. It offers the real programming experience: Lots of thinking, hard work, gathering information, debugging and some frustrations. But you will also learn new skills, become a better developer, and most of all enjoy that sweet sensation of finally cracking a hard problem.<h3>Open Ended Challenges</h3><ul><li> Real programming: No pseudo code, no imaginary language. Instead, fully functional python code with your favourite packages like numpy, pandas, scipy, pillow, sklearn and more. Some basic <strong>prior programming knowledge</strong> (in Python or otherwise) and a <strong>strong interested in programming is recommended</strong>.<br/></li><li> In-game IDE: A codemirror based in-game Python IDE offers syntax highlighting, auto-completion, docstring tooltips, debugging, auto-indentation, code-folding, copy/paste and undo/redo.<br/></li><li> Realistic challenges: From robotics to abstract algorithms and creative coding - the full breadth and depth of computer-science awaits.<br/></li><li> Open puzzle design: Each level has many different valid solutions.<br/></li><li> Clear goals: Each level has one mandatory goal and up to three optional goals.<br/></li><li> Immediate feedback: Never wonder whether your code is working. Get immediate, incremental feedback on each good (or bad) step towards a working solution.<br/></li><li> Performance metrics: Compare your best solution anonymously with others with respect to speed, memory usage and code length.<br/></li><li> No hard locks: Never get stuck on a single level, there are always several open challenges available.<br/></li><li> Weekly Challenge: Tackle a different scenario each week and compare your best solutions.<br/></li><li> Optionally submit your solution and your code to the leaderboards and share it with the world.</li></ul><h3>Designed by a Computer Science Professor</h3>The game is developed primarily by a single developer, who also happens to be a computer science professor. An accompanying Youtube series by the developer  is in the works to showcase example solutions for each level and walk through them step-by-step. Explaining the reasoning and programming principles along the way to help beginners get into the game and learn actual programming. The series will also feature selected community solutions to discuss other approaches and potential improvements.<h3>Level Editor and Modding Support</h3>An innovative Python based level editor allows creating and scripting new challenges, which can also be shared via the game's Workshop. Most current levels and all future levels included with the game are created with this editor. Custom assets like 3d objects, sound files, videos and images can be imported easily and used in the level editor. Full modding support to extend the game with custom mod PAKs is planned to be included by the end of Early Access.<br/><br/>Happy Coding and <strong>get JOY OF PROGRAMMING now!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/5378d54d25b50ba8a0df34fa7bffc8f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 60, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Prof. Scherer"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
