The first game was one of the earliest of the RTS genre, itself based on Westwood Studios&#39; landmark strategy game Dune II and introducing trademarks followed in the rest of the series. This includes full-motion video cutscenes with a notable ensemble cast to progress the story, as opposed to digitally in-game rendered cutscenes. Westwood Studios was taken over by Electronic Arts in 1998 and eventually closed down in 2003. The studio and some of its members were absorbed into EA Los Angeles, which continued development on the series.</p>", "metacritic": 94, "released": "1995-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-29T14:43:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c62/c62e21b805e3f4c13e99702d2eca6a65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.31, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 81, "beaten": 102, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 48, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 131, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 131, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation", "Classic Macintosh", "SEGA Saturn"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Los Angeles", "Westwood Studios", "Danger Close Games", "Electronic Arts Phenomic", "Victory Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "SEGA", "Nintendo", "Virgin Interactive", "Virgin Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
