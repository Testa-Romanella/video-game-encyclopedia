Just survive as long as you can without being hit!<br/>Place walls to protect yourself and earn points!</p>\n<p>Mechanics:<br/>- If a bullet bounces off a player-placed wall, you get a point.<br/>- Collect hearts around the map\u00a0to regenerate lost health.<br/>- Getting hit by a bullet decreases your health.<br/>- Question Marks are power ups that randomize bullet speeds when picked up. Dare to take the risk?</p>\n<p>Tips &amp; Tricks:<br/>- Don't get cornered! Bullets may bounce between you and the wall causing you to lose almost instantly.<br/>- Try to trap a bullet in a corner for basically infinite points (though it's super hard to pull off).<br/>- Bullets are faster than you, don't try to outrun them.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Controls:<br/>WASD + Arrow Keys - General movement.<br/>Right click - Place wall.</p>\n<p>Gamepad Controls:<br/>Left Analog Stick - General movement.<br/>Right Analog Stick - Rotation.<br/>\"A\" Button - Place wall.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T12:51:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/779/7797f23c1d74057eb0e25d97892cb784.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Luna_Mae_Bae"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
