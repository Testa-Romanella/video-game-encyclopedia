It SHOULD automatically set the resolution when you start the game, but if it doesn't, then... well, it's pretty much screwed. Thank you Android Studio for the DexArchiveMergerException, I don't think I'm gonna give mobile games another shot for a while.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:41:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b5166d1811b5f2053ddd140f46a2f11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["ElinGranath"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
