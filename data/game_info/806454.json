Codependency drives one to do some of the most maniacal things, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>I created this game as a way to express how difficult it is to deal with codependency issues. Personally, I find comfort in relating to Yuno. She's the face of the whole yandere stereotype. Please don't classify me as\u00a0one of those \"HAHAH SANS IS MINE\" people, I only wish to vent how I feel.</p>\n<p>The development of this game took place during a\u00a0rough time in my journey of healing. Someone cared for me and suddenly left due to my poor decisions, but I don't want to go into all that. It was difficult, but building this safe space for my lil' Yuno sprite was comforting. Being able to relate to her is helpful to me, it feels like someone's guiding me. It's like she's telling me \"Hey, it's okay, I went through this too\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T22:50:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15f8d44e7794dd9e34212503ba6a3300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SparkAcademy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
