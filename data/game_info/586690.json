So if you like my work -I seriously hope you do- please consider supporting it.<br/><br/>To get the latest release of the visual novel immediately as they are released, get development updates and to support <strong><em>Istanbul (not Constantinople)</em></strong> visual novel, please visit my Patreon page.</p><p>Due to itch.io space restrictions, the Android version of the game can be downloaded from the\u00a0Patreon page only -still free.<br/><br/><strong>Plot</strong><br/><br/>'<em><strong>Istanbul (not Constantinople)</strong></em>' is a complex, multi-layered story which tackles the East-West clash of civilizations in the modern era, through the lives of ordinary, everyday youths of different -and often contradicting- cultures.<br/><br/>Follow the story of a multitude of seemingly everyday people of all ages and walks of life. Witness how paths converge, stories start and end, and how best of friends can turn on each other, while mere strangers put their fates into each other's hands.<br/><br/><em>Istanbul (not Constantinople)</em>\u00a0visual novel is my first attempt at a visual novel. If I can promise you one thing about this story, it would be that it's full of twists and turns you won't see coming.<br/><br/>Though \"<em>Istanbul (not Constantinople)</em>\" is a visual novel, not a game, you will get to participate in the unfolding of the story. Your choices, knowledge and personal preferences will matter. Let's just say that not everyone will get to play through the same story; not in one run through anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T06:25:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f88/f88ac95908700b7e4b35fea709bb3589.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["the Flip Side"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
