But after showing it at the Melbourne Game Creatives Meetup group, I was lucky to count on the collaboration of Steve, Jess and Sergey, which has been a lot of fun and has driven the game way further than I anticipated.</p>\n<p>I want to thank everyone that helped me with play-testing and feedback:\u00a0Glenn, James\u00a0and Lawrence. Special thanks to Astrid and Albert for their ongoing support and feedback.</p>\n<p>We used a number of 3rd party assets (all free), and I'd like to also thank and credit the authors for their generosity:</p>\n<p>3D MODELS</p>\n<ul><li>\"Spike Trap Damage Animation\" (https://skfb.ly/o6JnC) by Marc Palma is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"trap\" (https://skfb.ly/69UWE) by 4lepy is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Spiky Tentacle Whip Animation\" (https://skfb.ly/6xFHY) by Celena Ransil is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Cobra\" (https://skfb.ly/IxsR) by spawnlucifer is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Column Head\" (https://skfb.ly/6XCXp) by supernovasnr is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Vasos Gregos\" (https://skfb.ly/6XoO9) by Matheus Mota is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Lowpoly Bones\" (https://skfb.ly/6XvoF) by Abbie Hipwell is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Helmet #02 - Blacksmith's workshop assets\" (https://skfb.ly/69GOC) by Kyan0s is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Stylized Grave Skull\" (https://skfb.ly/6ZzrH) by darkred21 is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Hand Painted - \"Shield\"\" (https://skfb.ly/6XUGH) by Damien98 is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li><li>\"Male Lowpoly Base Mesh\" (https://skfb.ly/6SxqB) by CarvMad is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</li></ul>\n<p>SFX</p>\n<ul><li>Steps: https://freesound.org/people/savataivanov/sounds/384082/</li><li>Spike trap: https://freesound.org/people/Merrick079/sounds/568169/</li><li>Death sound: https://freesound.org/people/rockittt/sounds/442288/</li><li>Wood breaking: https://freesound.org/people/gronnie/sounds/563175/</li><li>Stone breaking: https://freesound.org/people/iwanPlays/sounds/567249/</li><li>Plasma shot: https://freesound.org/people/newlocknew/sounds/514039/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T05:36:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f996312ca433e66b6729d5425a3f1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dense13"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
