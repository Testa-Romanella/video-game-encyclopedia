You play as Huey, a cartoon who has just been spun into existance by Mother (the character in the tank room). Mother is able to refine 'Saturation Stones' into pure color, which then can be used to restore color to the world! Your quest is to venture through the dangerous mines that hold these stones and bring them back to Mother. Gather stones and fill the tanks too 100%, but be aware you can only carry one color at a time!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Mobile: Left and Right Buttons Move.
