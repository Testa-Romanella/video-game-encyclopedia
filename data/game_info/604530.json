Reply and unlock the memory in the photo album.</p>\n<p>Inspired by: The Yayagram, a device built by Manuel Lucio Dallo that allowed his grandmother to use the messaging app Telegram in a way that is\u00a0reminiscent of a phone switchboard.</p>\n<p>Created during 2021 Fem Devs Game Jam.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong><br/>Go on the Yayagram, click on \"Listen\" to receive a prompt. One of your grandchildren tells you a story, you need to find out which grandchild it is. Look around the room for hints and then go back to the Yayagram, click on \"Anwer\" and the child you want to answer to. The goal is to answer all prompts correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Team\u00a0Yaya:</strong><br/>Ara Carrasco<br/>@aracarrascoart<br/><br/>Tula Eriksson Turtiainen<br/>@ErikssonTula<br/><br/>Alexandra Tofse<br/>@alexandrant5</p>\n<p>Laura Heimann<br/>@indiegesindel<br/><br/>Scarlett Fu<br/>@scarlett_fu</p>\n<p>Wolfgang Traenkle<br/>@WTraenkle<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:04:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d71/d71b4cd604f80f77ae24dd5f40e4d39c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acelyan", "indiegesindel", "sinceregames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
