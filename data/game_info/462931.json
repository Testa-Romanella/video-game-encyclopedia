She wants to get by with as little interaction with others as possible because of her social anxiety, but that hope is quickly diminished when she has to do an icebreaker activity with one of her classmates named Jared. They learn they both want to play an MMORPG called Guild Wars of Alvarydia, but didn't really know anyone to play it with since MMOs are more fun with friends. Jared gives Avery his contact information and asks to meet with her in-game after school. Avery spends the rest of the day anxious, worried about the online meetup with this person she just met. Will everything go fine? Or will things take a turn for the worse?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/895afa8143dd12eecbc4ff398e5708f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ariel Phillips"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
