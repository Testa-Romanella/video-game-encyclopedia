Shoot your way through zombies to level up your guns that you can customize in the gunsmith. Attachments will be unlocked when you level up your gun and new guns will be unlocked when you level up your player.<br/><br/><strong>General info:</strong><br/>This is a first person shooter project that I started creating in Godot Engine on the date  2020-01-03 and this is the result so far. The game is in one man development currently and more content will be added in future updates so I will need all the help I can get to progress forward. Report bugs, lags or just other feedback as improvement or suggestions in the development log \"Updates\". If you want to be part of this project in some kind of way contact me on my email.
