The reason I did this version is, that my niche did not know the game and when I wanted to show it to her, there were only versions for solo players or 1 vs 1 without AI enemies. Since I am way older than her, she has not a lot of fun playing against me, just to lose over and over again. Without hesitation I began to code this version with simple AI snakes for her and her little brother and delivered it 2 days later. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Winning Condition</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The aim in the current mode is to get the longest snake of all in the given time frame. If someone dies, his longest snake counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>While a running match you can return to the title screen at any time with \"R\".<br/></p>\n<p>First Player: Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Second Player: WASD</p>\n<p>Third Player: IJKL</p>\n<p>Fourth Player: Numpad 8456<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Coming Next<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Saving the options, so you do not have to change everything after every match will coming soon. Downloadable windows executable will be delivered.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Future Possibilites</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If someone is interested in more levels, more game modes or a tougher AI, just tell me and if there is some demand, I will take my time to code it. Even a custom key binding and controller support would be possible, if demanded.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/852/852d2d5e8040e85fa0d0aa736635288f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prone Playing Panda"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
