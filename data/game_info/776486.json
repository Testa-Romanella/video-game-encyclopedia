The campaign did not fund, but we still wanted to publicly share the demo that was built internally for design and testing.<br/></p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p>Game Design, Programming - Ross Squires</p>\n<p>Art - Nate Marcel</p>\n<p>Music, Sound - Tony Lodise</p>\n<p>Writing - Sara Lodise</p>\n<p>UI Design, Testing - Chad Breeden</p>\n<p>------------<br/></p>\n<p>STRATAGEM is a new spin on the tactical, turn-based game. You\u2019ll be \u00a0able to uncover your opponent\u2019s strategy several moves ahead, giving new \u00a0ways to analyze, experiment, and subvert. The adventure takes the Grey Hauler nuclear waste ship to a mysterious world. As they crash land, the \u00a0mysterious radiating tension fields of the planet mutate a faction of \u00a0the crew, giving them new abilities. As the marooned crew fends off the \u00a0harsh environment, you will be able to pair the characters\u2019 infused \u00a0powers with a tactical overlay that allows you to outmaneuver your \u00a0opponents.<br/></p>\n<p>------------<br/></p>\n<p>The Grey Hauler's twenty-sixth journey is routine, a ten-year round \u00a0trip to an E-type planet with the right atmospheric conditions (and the \u00a0legally required distance from Earth) to process the nuclear waste in \u00a0the Hauler's hold into priceless space fuel and bury the even more \u00a0dangerous process residue. Space Waste Corp, contracted by United Earth \u00a0to remove and 'dispose' of hazardous materials according to the Clean \u00a0Space Act, doesn\u2019t pay particularly well, but it\u2019s a decent job for most \u00a0of the five-hundred-person crew, considering they\u2019re paid half-time to \u00a0cryo-sleep. For the resident scientists, these journeys are God's work, \u00a0cleaning the Earth and surrounding space of its persistent pollutants. \u00a0For the waste handlers, this is the job their genetic abnormalities and \u00a0toxin immunities were made for.</p>\n<p>Captain Talz ignores his instinct to call off the landing when the \u00a0first crew member, a cook named Fae Long, winds up in the medical bay \u00a0with unexplainably extended arms and a developing skin condition. Space \u00a0Waste Corp never sent the missions with enough fuel to return home. He \u00a0knows they have to land and use the planet\u2019s Simethal deposits to \u00a0convert their waste load to fuel. The process is routine, and will only \u00a0take a few months with the patchwork equipment they have onboard.</p>\n<p>However, when the Hauler lands, surface scans show no trace of the \u00a0vital Simethal mineral in the planet's crust. Instead, where Space \u00a0Waste's long-range scanner had reported deep deposits, there are only \u00a0smoking canyons and craters. Something in the past decade caused the \u00a0mineral to combust\u2026 and destabilized the very surface of the planet. The \u00a0air tingles, as if an invisible field of tension is the only thing \u00a0holding the land together.</p>\n<p>The predicament of being stranded on a wild and volatile planet is \u00a0enough to tax the crew and its small corporate security force, but it \u00a0pales in comparison to the danger brewing in the Hauler\u2019s medical bay.</p>\n<p>--------------<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stratagem-game/stratagem-0<br/></p>\n<p><em>The software and media are owned by the individual contributors to the project.
