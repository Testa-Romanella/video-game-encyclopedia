While different zombies can use different skills to chase soldiers, the soldiers can use grenades or lasers to avoid them. Both teams should work together to win, so don't forget that you are not alone.<br/><br/><strong>This game does not bring your emotions to the surface.</strong><br/>Imagine yourself in an enclosed arena with tall, fast zombies screaming and running towards you. The only thing you have is a gun, with limited ammo, a laser and different grenades. You may have other mates, but they can also become zombies.<br/><br/><strong>Same thing over and over again.</strong><br/>You will start playing with some cool guns and cool zombies, but the more you play, the more you unlock other zombies and other guns.<br/><br/><strong>The \"arena\" is not designed to the game purpose.</strong><br/>Our team has made sure to design a map where smart players will be able to avoid zombies, and zombies will be able to surround players, depending only on map knowledge and thinking.<br/><br/>In this continually evolving title currently in alpha stage development, soldiers must try to survive against powerful zombies using all your weapons and items, and zombies should try to infect all players using skills and advantage traits.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T04:37:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e9/2e94a51412f7cc98897f15d36c9a4fdd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 346, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Avelar Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Avelar Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
