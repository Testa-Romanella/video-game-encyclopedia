There is still a lot of things missing (including the sound)... Lack of time.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>It's time for you\u00a0to fight the boss... your only weapons are spells. You gain your power from the runes you step on and absorb power from.</p>\n<p>Each combination of two runes gives you a spell which you can then use to defeat the boss. But beware, some combinations are inactive</p>\n<p>You will have to work on your memory to remember the effects of spells and the most suitable combinations for your fight.</p>\n<p>Game after game, the rune / spell combinations are randomized... so that you can fight again and again without getting too bored</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move with arrows (or WASD), dash or launch spell with space bar</p>\n\n<p>Thanks and credits</p>\n<p>I used a enhanced\u00a0SLSO8 color palette made by\u00a0Luis Miguel Maldonado</p>\n<p>Some visual effect \u00a0(due to a lack of time)\u00a0came from amazing\u00a0Ninja Adventure assets pack\u00a0by\u00a0Pixel Boy and\u00a0AAA.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T09:45:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc3/fc3ea4b9659ba882d00637d533bc2e3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["LittleB0xes"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
