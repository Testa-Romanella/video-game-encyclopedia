It allows the player (or any NPC) to connect with their environment in a more organic-looking way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An example of this seamless integration between player and environment is when, in almost any Assassin's Creed game, the player can blend or hide seamlessly into their environment, such as a bar or a group of people talking. However, these situations are specifically placed throughout the world, whereas this takes a more systems-based approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While this is definitely\u00a0not a game\u00a0(yet), it does explore the potential advantages of using contextual animations as a core game mechanic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently all you will see is a character in a scene with various blue geometric objects. The character picks up the cylinder using a contextual animation. Animations for the character and other objects (such as the wall or NPC)\u00a0will come later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a more detailed understanding of the coding structure and potential applications, please see my devlog.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/944/9442153284fb0bca048107f46309f1cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Robbins"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
