Time to dive into your creativity and fish out some fresh new ideas!</p>\n<p>Now, a couple of tips before you start:</p>\n<p>1. Use Left/Right Arrows or A/D to move; use Down Arrow or S to fish.</p>\n<p>2. When you get an idea, you can use it on the current episode or keep it in your head for later. Both options are valid.</p>\n<p>3. Make sure you leave enough time to put the ideas you've collected on paper. We cannot sell what's still in your head ;)</p>\n<p>4. Try not to reuse the same idea in one episode. Readers can get bored, you know.</p>\n<p>5. You should be aware of how well your current episode will be received by the readers *off the top of your head*.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Edward Itor</p>\n<p>Editor @ Deep Sea Manga Weekly</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T10:15:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b5/2b560501c7444f83f1443b94d099a0e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wenlong"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
