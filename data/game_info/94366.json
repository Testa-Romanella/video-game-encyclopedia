This is a game that focuses on exploring varied environments and puzzles accompanied by curious visuals and sounds.</p>\n<p>While I am highly appreciative of those who have already played this game since its release in 2014, I am disappointed to have not attracted the attention of more. It is for this reason that I have elected to upload the game here in an effort to invite those unfamiliar with my work to start with something I am happy with.</p>\n<p>While not required, I ask that if you enjoy this game that you consider donating. If you are unable to donate, I would appreciate it if you shared this game or anything else found at my website with your friends! It should also be noted that donors are enrolled in my Semi-Regular Project Update E-Mails!</p>\n<p>You can also find the game's two original soundtracks here:<br/>https://hubol.bandcamp.com/album/little-flower<br/>https://hubol.bandcamp.com/album/big-strong-flower</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the game, launcher, or anything else, you can always mention me on Twitter @hubol.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Content Warning: This game contains an optional room full of illustrated dicks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fc/0fcfccaac4978b56aa6be1553098622f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["hubol"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
