Urban Brawl has been remastered for 2021; the same great mod you remember now features a host of quality-of-life updates, bug-fixes and graphical enhancements. Urban Brawl: Reloaded is available now, but first, what\u2019s new in this rerelease?<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Time to up the ante</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Urban Brawl now features a robust set of fighting mechanics which were not possible with ZDoom in 2008. Unleash a devastating new uppercut on your enemies, slam the ground to give yourself some breathing room, or grab your foes and toss them into one another.\r\n</li><li><strong>It ain\u2019t easy being GZ</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Urban Brawl has been completely overhauled to take advantage of modern hardware acceleration. Originally released for ZDoom, Urban Brawl: Reloaded runs properly in Vulkan and OpenGL\u2014no more software hacks!\r\n</li><li><strong>Don\u2019t have time to play with myself</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Fire up GZDoom or Zandronum and play competitively or cooperatively. Urban Brawl is multiplayer compatible. While GZDoom is the preferred port, Zandronum is available for those looking for an online experience with client-server capabilities. Join three other friends and punch, kick, and bash your way through the Urban Brawl co-op campaign or merceless bludgeon them in deathmatch in one of these Zandronum servers: [TSPG] Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl co-op Hard : [TSPG] Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl Survival Hard : [TSPG] Action Doom 2: Urban Brawl Deathmatch\r\n</li><li><strong>Back on track</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Brawl-out to new music by the original composer, Ralphis.\r\n</li><li><strong>So two thousand and late</strong>\u00a0\u2013 In addition to new mechanics, you\u2019ll also enjoy ultra-widescreen compatible cutscenes, visually retouched maps, and a brand new boss encounter replacing the often maligned topical humor from the mid 2000s!\r\n</li><li><strong>An inside snow-job</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Dead of Winter has also been updated to work properly and is now included with the base game.</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/><br/><strong>Sluggard</strong>: Coding &amp; support for the 1.2 release.
