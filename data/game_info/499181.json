Your item bar acts as your hand, while your bag acts as your \"deck\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your primary weapons are\u00a0 Shotgun, AR-15 and MP5. as far as tcg goes, very-time you fire a bullet, you play an \"action\". If you have auto Hotbar active, so that it cycles for you, you will automatically play the card in that slot.</p>\n<p>Each gun has base stats, you can use and collect cards that slimes will drop to boost the firepower of your weapon. Be careful though, build to powerful of a combo and your weapon will overheat and explode.</p>\n<p>The idea is to create combos of cards on your hot bar that sync with your weapon to put out the most amount of sustained DPS. you can collect soul dust to buy more cards form the local trader.</p>\n<p>I Do want to revisit this idea with a more robust system. Right now the game only works in HTML5.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy and thanks for checking it out!</p>\n<p>H for Help.</p>\n<p>AWSD for movement,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse for looking</p>\n<p>Left button to fire</p>\n<p>E to equipped weapon</p>\n<p>T to drop Gun</p>\n<p>R to auto cycle hot bar</p>\n<p>C for extended controls.</p>\n<p>So I pretty much was not able to finish this project due to a number of bugs and unwilling to really complete it without fixing those bugs. About halfway through this project I was thinking this is actually a really interesting concept that i might want to sit down and take more time hashing out.<br/></p>\n<p>Let me know what you guys think :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T06:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68aee32333abdc6893385ae0d47178b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kadin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
