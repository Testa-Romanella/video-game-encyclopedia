It is a memory game, in which you are trapped in a room that repeats itself over and over again, each time adding a new object. Aside from the room itself (not the objects in it), all 3D assets were obtained from Unity's Asset Store. The game is controlled with a keyboard and mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f50/f50096b0f0b79d0bb699a0750e78f3bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sena Bryer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
