Upon seeing this, I thought it was a perfect fit for the NES - It could easily pass for a puzzle game made during that era... If it had some nice presentation and less annoying ads between sessions.</p>\n\n<p>So since I thought it'd be fun, I decided to make just that: Blazing Blocks for the NES! This game contains:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Addicting puzzle gameplay!</li><li>Ming-boggling demo FX!</li><li>An attract mode!</li><li>Six different backgrounds to choose from (4 with animations!)</li><li>Both NTSC\u00a0<strong>AND</strong> PAL compatibility!</li><li>Tubular Tunes by Ma2e!</li></ul>\n<p>The object of the game is simple: You have an array of 3 randomly generated blocks at your disposition. Place them all on the screen... If you can! Once you get rid of the 3 blocks to place, new ones appear - but the playfield gets more tightly-packed with every move. The only solution is to make horizontal or vertical lines to clear out blocks so you have just enough room to place that next block coming your way. If the task seems too daunting: Fret not! With three life-saving bonuses at your disposal, you can make sure to place that one block that gets you out of a pickle!\u00a0Hours of fun guaranteed in\u00a0<strong><em>Blazing Blocks</em></strong>, from FG Software!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>D-Pad: Select blocks/bonuses, move blocks around the playfield</li><li>A: Select block/bonus, place block/bonus on the screen.</li><li>B: Put block back</li><li>SELECT: Place block in the HOLD area for future use</li></ul>\n<p>Bonuses:</p>\n<ul><li>Bomb: Clears some blocks around the point of impact</li><li>Hammer: Hammers the blocks downwards, and is sure to get you a nice combo!</li><li>Cross-Out: Clears the column and row of where it is placed</li></ul>\n\n<p>Some pro-tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Try clearing many lines at once, and to get streaks! The bigger those combos get, the higher the score increase!</li><li>Choose your hold blocks strategically. Single blocks are valuable!</li><li>If you're in trouble, but have the hammer, make sure to get as many blocks in each column before using the bonus!</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Programming, Graphics, SFX: Antoine Fantys</li><li>Music: Stian \"mA2E\" Gudbrandsen (https://soundcloud.com/user-902495696)</li></ul>\n<p>Major thanks to <strong>Fiskbit</strong> for valuable feedback, hardware expertise, and PAL testing!!!</p>\n<p>And of course, you for playing the game.
