In order to escape that, before lockdown could shut the traffic down, he ventured into the deserted plains and got lost. Lost! Can you imagine? Your help as a dog lover is needed to make the dog move around, explore the plains and reach the exit point to be found by its owner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beware of poisonous plants lying around, and do not lose your health on it. Who knew there would be speed mushrooms to boost up your speed and help you reach the exit\u00a0 point, and find its owner?\u00a0 Also dont' forget to eat as many bones as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make sure to reach the exit on time or else you will be stuck here forever.
