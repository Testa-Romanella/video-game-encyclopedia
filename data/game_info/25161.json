This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.</p>\n<p>The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.</p>\n<p>This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-05T23:41:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/127/127a986dd3867ca6c529377b07f57882.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 78, "beaten": 38, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 49, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 70, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 70, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Atari 8-bit", "Android", "Wii", "Wii U", "NES", "Apple II", "Atari ST", "iOS", "Classic Macintosh", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Broderbund Software"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Broderbund Software"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
