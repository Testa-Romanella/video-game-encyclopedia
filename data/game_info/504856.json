While struggling to get attached to the theme, I started working on random art assets. Those assets pointed me in a direction of a \"graveyard\" theme. Rogue-like randomness and the sudden urge to make a third person game brought Endless Night to life.\u00a0I hope you have some fun blasting zombies, skeletons, and ghosts in the face with your magic. Get in there and empower that graveyard!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T12:44:17", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ark"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
