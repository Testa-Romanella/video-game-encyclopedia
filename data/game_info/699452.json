It's a short, story driven experience that will help myself and my team determine how to proceed with the creation of Scrimshaw. I hope to get feedback on the game, good and bad, and I'll continue to change and improve it alongside the development of the main game.</p>\n<p>Here's a feedback form to fill out if you'd like to. I'd very much appreciate it: https://forms.gle/RPSzq42zbsoYjUkh7<br/></p>\n<p>Other than that, have fun, explore, break stuff and then tell me all about it.</p><p>P.S. Sadly the system audio recording quality on my PC is below lapel mic in a wind tunnel levels of quality, so guess you'll have to play the game for the true sonic experience<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:00:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/627/6277352c776fa4845cace551b95cb8c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tincture"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
