You believe you have been helping people with your books, after all you write about the most important thing there is - the purpose of life.\u00a0 However, one of your readers unloads an entire clip from an assault rifle at the signing.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>You have been shot and you wake up to an entity asking you to play a game. What does it want? Are you really dead? Can you quit the game? Does quitting mean death? These broken boards will decide your fate\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo containing the first 15 puzzles of the full game.
