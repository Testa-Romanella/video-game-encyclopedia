It uses the castle, fantasy, furniture, graveyard, holiday, nature, pirate, platformer, racing, water, space and weapon packs! <br/></p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to discover as many creations as possible that can be created using the wishing well.</p>\n<p>See what Unlikely Combinations you can create!<br/></p>\n<p>Throw items in to the wishing well by looking at them and using the left mouse button.<br/></p>\n<p>The wishing well is connected to a nearby computer system. Clicking on the computer will cause the wishing well to grant your wish, and create a new item.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately I found throwing things into a well so fun that I didn't have enough time to completely finish the game. I wanted to implement a monetary system into the game, where simple objects could be bought.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>WASD and Mouse movement.</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Some of the sounds in this project were created by David McKee (ViRiX)<br/>soundcloud.com/virix</p>\n\n<p>Install instructions:<br/>Windows - Extract zip file and run 'Unlikely Combinations.exe'.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-12T06:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b6/2b628926123a2d01364d9cd4605c9415.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["nateonus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
