This game features 5 levels and a boss fight, and was made in the Unity Game Engine. This was a side project of mine where I wanted to focus some of my development skills into a 2D game for a change, and I am pretty happy with how it came out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e83c8c94134e86870dcce5f3ad8b3a3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["jtnoble"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
