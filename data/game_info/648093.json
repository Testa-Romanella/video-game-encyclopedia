{"id": 648093, "slug": "ease-collection", "name": "Ease Collection", "name_original": "Ease Collection", "description": "<p>Back in 2017, I made a game on Scratch called \"Ease\" which featured an alien named Ease traversing through nine levels (it was really two) and then fighting against Dream Ease. It was a really basic concept and wasn't really even a game but it stuck. Soon a sequel came along but before I knew it, it was a trilogy. Then, I worked for about a week and made Ease 4. This game remakes the first four Ease games on Clickteam to celebrate four years of Ease! This completely remakes them from scratch (no pun intended) and completely transform them. This will be my second game made on Clickteam and I will update this if anybody wishes.</p>\n\n<p>Made on June 27th of 2017. This game featured the first three characters: Ease, Brother Ease, and Dream Ease. It was a fairly basic platformer with only two levels and two bosses. The jumping was broken and the bosses were basic. The text and screens were quite boring too. However, this remake will hopefully improve the bosses, the text, the screens, and the jumping. But most of all, this game will finally get nine levels.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This game is an arcade-like game where you fight four bosses in a row. This has already been released as \"Ease 2: Da remake\" and if you played it you probably know what to expect when the remade Ease 2 gets released in Ease collection. In the original game released on July 4th of 2017, you played as Ease in a simple environment while unoriginal music plays in the background and then the unoriginal bosses attack you. Its like one of those random boss rush games. However, the remade version with new features such as \"Code Green\", Hard Mode, and an endless mode where you can fight the bosses. The new bosses are original characters. This is kind of like one of those survival arcade games.</p>\n\n<p>There were four worlds however in the original July 4th of 2017 version. This is another platformer game where Ease embarks on yet another adventure this time in many different locations unlike in the last two. This one wasn't that bad but it can certainly be improved upon. Luckily, the remake of this game will deliver and switching worlds will be more convenient.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This one is more action-packed probably due to the new villain: Ifei. Ifei builds a castle and Ease must travel there to prevent Easeland from being destroyed by Ifei. The gameplay from the July 24th of 2017 version consists of glitchy platforming but good bosses. The bosses are the best thing about this game. However, there also exists the infamous infinite jump non-glitch. I couldn't figure out how to fix it back then and I just gave in and made it apart of the story. Well, this version will make the world map less crammed too I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Ease Collection will include:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Remastered ports of the first four Ease games\r\n</li><li>An overarching story with an epic final boss!\r\n</li><li>A fully fledged two-player mode!\r\n</li><li>The original ports of the first four games!\r\n</li><li>A bonus menu with tons of Ease games over the years including some lost ones! (Some may even have bonus content)\r\n</li><li>For the first time ever: Saving and Loading progress!\r\n</li><li>An original soundtrack!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Ease Collection is developed with Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and will credit them as needed. Ease Collection will be around the $2.99-$4.99 price range but no more with a free demo version if nothing intervenes. There is no release date yet. Ease Collection is made by HatPassStudios and no other account is me and no Ease game made by any other account (except DunkGamez/@Lsmar2 who is managing Ease on Scratch) is official and most likely a fan project.\u00a0\u00a0Ease Collection will support English, Spanish, Japanese, and Russian.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T05:40:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1d1d516cd9e5cbd3d2bf73530bffd79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HatPass"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
