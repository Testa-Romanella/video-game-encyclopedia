A special kind of doctor from the Astel family. You have been sent to a city where rumours of a new plague have been reported. Although you cannot help the sick you decide to leave the city and get help. Only to find out that the plague was only a small part of the world going insane.<br/><br/>This game is an action adventure game inspired by Zelda 2. It features hard combat, puzzles, collectables and bosses that will make demand of your skill.<br/><br/>The demo is a small part of the game. Around the first 2 \"levels\" for a lack of a better term. The future \"levels\" will be around the size of these two combined if not bigger. Around 7 new levels are planned not counting side quests. With the rate at which I am going I expect the game to be finished in 4-3.5 years. This is something I am making in any spare time I can scrap together.<br/><br/>Any feedback is HIGHLY appreciated for I have a hard time finding playtesters. This is the big reason why I am releasing this demo... to have people play it.<br/><br/>You can follow me on Twitter for frequent updates: @DraymaDev<br/>You can also follow me on Youtube for not so frequent updates: https://www.youtube.com/@iridescentgamedevlogs5313<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T13:52:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b625297ff88cb061ade2855fb50f3e08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DraymaDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
