A game, a dialogue, a provocation, the zine maps out the Marcoses\u2019 ill-gotten wealth in New York through a game of monopoly.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The webzine takes on the POV of Marcos to show the frivolity and sheer ridiculousness of not only the theft he committed but also his refusal to repent for his sins to the public. Rolling the dice points to words and phrases, instead of numbers, to open up conversations and reflections on Martial Law, overriding the myth-making his family continues to propagate to erase the atrocities they have done to the Philippine republic.</p>\n<p>Read more about Martial Law in this\u00a0open access digital library.</p>\n<p><em>Kwago</em> is the first publishing laboratory in the Philippines.
