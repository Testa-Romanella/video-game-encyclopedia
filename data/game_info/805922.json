The giraffe and lion assets were created and animated in Blender by myself, while the other animals were imports that were coded by me.\u00a0You can look around and if you look at certain animals, there is a chance they may perform a special action! This demo is meant to be experienced in VR so there will probably be some bugs or glitches. Regardless, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T19:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac1/ac1f1f4dc49940f0b6cd0b87d58cf689.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LargeKowalski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
