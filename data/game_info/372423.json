Moreover, the way we are allowing the player to choose from the different abilities also slightly differs as the player won\u2019t have all of them equipped at the same time.</p>\n<p>During this game the player will find a calming, yet not easy, path to follow. The player can freely explore the map and make decisions on some matters. Between levels, magic, moving platforms, boxes to push and other things to collect, it offers various interaction moments throughout the game.</p><p>All Music and SFX are from: <br/>opengameart.org<br/>freesound.org<br/>actionvfx.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:31:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98b/98b22283846805e00d60b9bb38da34ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PurpleCowGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
