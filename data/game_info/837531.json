My gaming system of choice was farming. The goal of the assignment is to obtain expertise in project design, inter-system communication, and data management (such as managing information from all the systems). The majority of my effort was spent making sure these parts functioned correctly, so I had to get creative in order to make the other aspects of my game acceptable given the time constraints and my skill level.<br/></p>\n<p>I was able to design and implement a game architecture that supports organised data processing and inter-system communication as I obtain a deeper grasp of C# and general programming principles, vocabulary, structure, and syntax.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T15:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06e61c24b8c13b6a47c8cbe48def530.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rudi Naud\u00e8"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
