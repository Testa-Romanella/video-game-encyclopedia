You have one minute left on earth,\u00a0 make sure you say goodbye in my game \"Time of Goodbying\"!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Developer's note:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This game is so early in development</em>.</strong> <strong><em>I literally </em></strong><strong><em>made this prototype in just over an hour</em></strong>, and then spent a little time adjusting a couple of things here and there and getting logos/ title stuff done. This is pretty quick (and rushed), but as the title says this is a proof of concept. The game will change overtime<strong><em> (if it is worked on)</em></strong> and is not playable at the moment. Once a little more polish is added and a few more things have been implemented it will be available to download. (hopefully soon!). Anything can change about the game( even the mechanics and game objective might change overtime),<strong><em> so what is seen is not a final representation of gameplay.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The aim of the game here is to try and come into contact with the people around you (represented by blue squares in a screenshot, they flash around the screen but you can't tell from a picture) before the one minute timer runs out. I am hoping to get a little more design into this (both gameplay and art) in the future (if I continue to work on this, which I probably should). Stay tuned to see more out of this, and thank you for your time!</p>\n<p><strong>-LebbyFoxx</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T06:08:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315db731af909266a47d92828dc5e120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
