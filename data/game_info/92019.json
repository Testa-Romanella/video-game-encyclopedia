Seven types of enemies and a giant boss stand in your way. You pick up a selection of 15 random weapons to kill your way up to the boss. AlienVania hits that GameBoy style, resolution, color scheme and even original music with a selection of color pallets including the Virtual Boy.</p><p><strong>QUICK FEATURES<br/></strong></p><p> - MetroidVania map spanning a grid of 19 x 4<br/> - Exploration, secrets, destructible blocks<br/> - 15 guns<br/> - Mega Man - ish play style with bigger guns<br/> - 160 x 144 resolution (is that a feature?)<br/> - 4 colors on screen at once! (your choice of 6 pallets)<br/> - 7 types of enemies &amp; 1 boss fight<br/> - An ending! (our usual work is endless arcade)<br/></p><p><strong>GAME HISTORY</strong><br/>Made for the GameBoy 5 jam in 10 days. We had quite a procedural level system going, but with 48 hours to go, we shifted gears and hand made something that would be more enjoyable in the time allowed.</p><p><strong>ALIENVANIA X: REMADE AFTER THE GAME JAM</strong></p><p>Yes indeed the game was completely remade. It might play similar and it uses the same assets, but it uses the Collector Kyle engine .... with guns. Here is what is actually new:</p><p>New from the original game:<br/> - Added new versions of weapons<br/> - Added get a weapon, keep a weapon<br/> - Added weapon ammunition<br/> - Added weapon selection menu<br/> - Added different, but more predictable enemy behavior<br/> - Added solid object outlines, player outlines, enemy outlines, projectile outlines<br/> - Added more color palettes<br/> - Added Auto-look camera to compensate for how tiny the resolution is<br/> - Added vibration and screen shake percentages rather than on and off<br/> - Added slide ability</p><strong>CREDITS</strong><p>A game by:<br/><strong>Sitebender</strong></p><p>Pixel art from:<br/><strong>Freshbone</strong></p><p>Original music composed by:<br/><strong>@Replay_50101</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2af56ee75f4e2adcb79505b7f1410d4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sitebender"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
