I entered the 48 hour compo with this BGE game (ahh I miss the good old days of BGE)</p>\n<p>Windows version and source both available (note Blender 2.62 is required to edit and run it in BGE but Ive tested with\u00a0Blender 2.8 which can still at least open the file and view various things).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Original info as follows:</p>\n<p>My Entry for LD 23 - An attempt at a 3D survival horror in an insane 48 hours. Highlights of LD23 included TWO power blackouts (the first was for 7-8 hours).<br/><br/>Game Summary:<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>You play as an unknown character, whos been rejected by the people he belongs to. You've spent too long, lying on the floor in a dark and abandoned old dungeon, completely forgotten.<br/>Suddenly you take it upon yourself to escape, and so that is your main mission - starting by escaping the cell youve been in for an immeasurable amount of time, into an unknown and potentially dangerous environment.<br/>Lots of critters scurry about the floor, and with thanks to a special ability (the very ability which got you into so much trouble in the first place) you find you can inhabit the bodies of the smaller creatures scurrying nearby.<br/><br/>Maybe this will be your first step towards being free again?<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Made with Blender(BGE), Gimp, Audacity and coded in Python.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;Read the Readme.txt!&lt;&lt;<br/>Controls are in there, I didnt have time to add all of the instructions in-game, but most major controls made it into actual in-game popups.<br/><br/>**** Missing VCOMP100.dll error????<br/>Some people have reported that the game wont run due to a 'missing VCOMP100.dll' error. This is to do with not having installed the Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable on your system<br/>Its a pain that this is happening, but quick google search will come up with several different places to download (go for the one hosted on the Microsoft website). Once thats installed everything should go smoothly.\u00a0<br/>****<br/><br/>Full 48 hour timelapse of the creation of the game below!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-27T04:02:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1de/1de5c0323ad078819520463b23c67e98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex_ADEdge"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
