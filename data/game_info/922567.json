It includes first person as well as 3rd person segments. During combat, the player can choose between 3 different attack stances including melee, armed, and armed projectile. The goal of the game is to collect the ship parts necessary to leave the deserted asteroid base. Each enemy in the game holds a part to the ship the player must retrieve before taking off. Art assets are used from the Synty Sci-Fi City and Sci-Fi Space packs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T07:55:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a4d589b068154407cf3894a8aa3bc73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryan Wilson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
