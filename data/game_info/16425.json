Backwoods village was somehow teleported into the USA and it threatens to cause irreversible consequences for entire universe!<br />\nIn order to save the world once again Pete and Vasily Ivanovich will have to get through fire, water and through\u2026 some other stuff and then again and again.<br />\nThey will get really close to the worst criminals on Las-Vegas streets, enlist in the commandos and complete several missions for the USA government - to get rid of drug dealer&#39;s band in jungles of Central America, to fight against Saddam Hussein and even to make a trip to Alaska.<br />\nAs usual, Pete and Vasily Ivanovich will get some help from their old friends from previous episodes. So meet the Anka (this time she is a FBI agent), Furmanov (he is a Mormon preacher now) and Kuzmich who suddenly discovered a rare artist talent.
