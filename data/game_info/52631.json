{"id": 52631, "slug": "star-fire", "name": "Star Fire", "name_original": "Star Fire", "description": "<p>Star Fire a first person space shooter arcade game released by Exidy in 1979. It is the first arcade game to use a sit-down cockpit, and the first arcade game to allow a player to enter his or her initials into the high score table. Star Fire is in full color without the use of monitor overlays, which was unusual in 1979.</p>\n<p>The look and feel of Star Fire is directly lifted from the movie Star Wars, though the game is not officially licensed. The attract-mode displays the name Star Fire in the same swooping sans-serif display typeface used by the Star Wars main titles. The enemy spaceships are TIE fighters and the player's primary weapon is an array of 4 lasers that fire in an \"X\" pattern, implying that the player is flying a ship somewhat akin to an X-wing. The enemy base looks like the Death Star.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1979-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-24T10:57:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/452/4526a8648ad2c82efc1cf8e286ba3781.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Exidy"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Exidy"], "esrb_rating": null}
