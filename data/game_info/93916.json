The two had collaborated for years on game development and animations on the Amiga and PC before starting the work on Pila.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIn 2016 Pila was discovered and brought to glory by renowned retro gaming guru Bobby, who owns the combined retro gaming and toy store, barber shop and arcade in Copenhagen, Ruben og Bobby.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tPila was developed for MS-DOS in Turbo Pascal and Assembly Language using no game development tools. All graphics were done in amazing Deluxe Paint. Thanks to DOSBox (the open source DOS emulator), the game now runs smoothly on Windows and Mac.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/2442482526cd9ae56c122208c7e90b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Remedium Amoris"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
