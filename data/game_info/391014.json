Below you will find the rules on how to play.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Background</strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by the original game, our final year assignment was created around the basics of the board game by the same name. We are a team of three students, and we had approximately four full weeks each of development of the game minus University assignments on the topic. Not a lot of time to develop a fully functional game from scratch \u2013 so hopefully you find some enjoyment from it and can recommend improvements so if we move further with the project, it will be in the right direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>\n<p>The game is based on a single scenario from the board game, you compete directly against another player via a computer \u2018hotseat\u2019 This means that after you have your turn, you click end turn and move away so player two may sit down and plan out their round (no peeking!) Until someone either reaches the objective or vanquishes the opposing player.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The rules</strong></p>\n<p>Basic rules are available in a quick menu select screen in game, but more expanded rules are as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Basics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The objective in this scenario is to reach a pre-determined place on the map. As a forward observation platoon, you have five squads under your command.</li><li>Player one starts in the bottom left corner, player two starts in the top right.</li><li>Each player must decide on how they advance and what direction they take. Do you lay an ambush? or push hard and fast to your objective?</li><li>Each squad consists of four soldiers</li><li>Each soldier has 25 health, the total of each squad is 100 health.</li><li>Action points are used for all directives of your units, each unit gets three action points per round. After all units have expended all their action points it is the end of your turn. (note \u2013 you do not have to spend all your action points to pass your turn)</li><li>The main squad options consist of the following choices \u2013<ul><li>Move \u2013 Each Hex a squad moves consumes 1 action point</li><li>Fire \u2013 There are two types of firing, focused fire and blind firing. Each consumes 1 action point.<ul><li>Focused fire is when you have sighted the enemy via searching an area or via observing them on open ground, the damage is only affected by defensive penalties due to their cover circumstances.</li><li>Blind firing \u2013 At any time your squads can cover fire into any hex within range, it does incur a penalty to damage submitted though.</li></ul></li><li>Search \u2013 Players using search as they progress have a much better chance to avoid ambushes, locating enemy squads or identifying civilians hiding in buildings (more on civilians later). A search will reveal a squad if in the hex searched, additionally the search will highlight surrounding hexes, but will only reveal an enemy squad if they are not in cover (open ground). The searched area lasts two turns before returning back to fog of war.</li><li>Breach \u2013 The act of storming a building, breaching a building can be enacted in two ways<ul><li>Force breach (1 action point) \u2013 You rush the building, it can be dangerous, but only consumes 1 action point. If you know the buildings empty it allows you to setup a firing position very quickly.</li><li>Search &amp; Breach \u2013 a strategic breach that prepares your team for the worst. If you are unsure who may be inside this is the safest move forward.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Unit Information</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Each squad consists of four soldiers</li><li>Each soldier has 25 health, the total of each squad is 100 health.</li><li>Action points are used for all directives of your units, each unit gets three action points per round.

There are three main layers of protection in the game relating to the game, these include buildings and foliage.</p>\n<p>The three layers of protection are \u2013</p>\n<p><strong>Damage deductions</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>\n<p>Type</p><p>Damage Deduction</p><p>Units Hidden</p><p>One story Building</p><p>25 points</p><p>Yes</p><p>Two story Building</p><p>50 points</p><p>Yes</p><p>Three story Building</p><p>75 points</p><p>Yes</p><p>Four story Building +</p><p>75 points</p><p>Yes</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Foliage</strong></p>\n<p>Type</p><p>Damage Deduction</p><p>Units Hidden</p><p>Light</p><p>25 points</p><p>No</p><p>Medium</p><p>25 points</p><p>No</p><p>Heavy</p><p>25 points</p><p>Yes</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>\n<p>Type</p><p>Damage Deduction</p><p>Units Hidden</p><p>Light</p><p>25 points</p><p>No</p><p>Medium</p><p>25 points</p><p>No</p><p>Heavy</p><p>25 points</p><p>No</p>\n<p>\r\nThese affects reduce the amount of damage your squad takes from fire, the heavier the cover, the less damage they take. If your squad is caught under fire the get no reductions in damage, this can be devastating to a squad caught in open ground.</p>\n<p>Please also note that some terrain hides your squads from view, and will only be visible when searched, while other areas don\u2019t conceal squads.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Civilians</strong></p>\n<p>Hiding in buildings may be civilians caught up in the war. When breaching buildings civilian casualties may occur. By searching buildings before breaching or using search &amp; breach instead of force breach you lower the chance of casualties. Casualties cause effects to squad morale (see below)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Morale</strong></p>\n<p>Squads may suffer morale penalties due to losing soldiers or indirectly killing civilians, penalties to morale affect their firing accuracy and damage sustained. Morale effect increases as a percentage, but also decays over time. If it gets too high, somethings holding the line is better than moving forward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Community</strong></p>\n<p>Discord -\u00a0https://discord.gg/mSkZ89N<br/>Facebook\u00a0-\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/TeamHiveStudio\r\n<br/>Twitter -\u00a0https://twitter.com/studios_hive\r\n<br/>Website -\u00a0https://teamhive.squarespace.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Contributors</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Isouljah -\u00a0https://isouljah.itch.io/<br/>The_Bazman -\u00a0https://the-bazman.itch.io/<br/>BenjaminNyght -\u00a0https://benjaminnyght.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a79/a79ff751874c38f329923c2f5f8237ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The_Bazman", "Benjamin Finlay", "Isouljah"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
