Players explore randomly generated vast dungeons and battle monsters swarming the screen in thousands and attacking from all directions along the floors, walls, and ceilings of the dungeons. As the game progresses, the heroes will find increasingly devastating and spectacular ways to defeat massive enemy forces in the forms of new abilities and weapons, or even create their own arsenal by combining the existing ones. Taking maximum advantage of the Xbox 360 online features, single-player and multiplayer modes are merged seamlessly. Players may choose to play alone, or better yet, recruit 4-player parties on the way and continue their quest as a team via Xbox Live. Each player can take their single-player characters to the co-op mode or create a new character with useful skills to compliment each other. They can even trade their own custom-crafted items with other party members.</p>", "metacritic": 55, "released": "2007-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5cd/5cd01be69c8d623017e790b456ac4be9.jpg", "website": "http://www.kufcod.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 606, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["BLUESIDE", "DragonFly Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
