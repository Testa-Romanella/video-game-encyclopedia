I wish you good luck in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Mainly at rest is a climbing game similar to Getting over it but this time you will need your legs and endurance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Climb a huge snow mountain full of pitfalls and traps to overcome all obstacles and end the suffering.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- But the game isn't as hard as it seems to follow your path and you'll make it<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- With the help of your leg, you'll soon be able to run, jump and fly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- The average playing time of the tester is 2 hours. I thank them in advance for the pooc in the development of the game.<br/>\r\n(I didn't finish the game)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nShow me what you can do and conquer my challenge!<br/>\r\n(Good luck)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T15:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f56b36debb261e85c19472150e85e078.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel Seman"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Daniel Seman"], "esrb_rating": null}
