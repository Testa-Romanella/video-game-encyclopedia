These bosses will begin sending out spawners, which\u00a0spawn the corresponding enemy ships. The spawners will generate enemy ships infinitely as they are defeated until the player has defeat the main boss.</p><p>- Players can break asteroids or\u00a0ship salvage, and defeat enemies to collect each type of resource, which can then be used to upgrade their ship and improve their fighting odds.</p><p>- After defeating all 3 of the main bosses the player has completed the game, however, they can also choose to continue the fight. By continuing the game, the bosses will begin to respawn after they are defeated, allowing players to achieve as high a score as possible or explore the galaxy as they please.</p>\n<p><strong>Side Notes:</strong></p><p>- All concepts, assets(art/script/audio), etc. were created from scratch by\u00a0Chris Goebel [Neonpe].</p>\n<p>- The upgrade menu implements\u00a0a toggle slider system, allowing players to fine-tune the control of their ship however they like. Some may prefer a slower rotation speed and faster thrust speed for faster movement, but steadier aim, while others may prefer a quick rotation speed for snappy aiming.</p>\n<p>- The main bosses of each enemy species\u00a0currently have a placeholder sprite and should not be taken as the final implementation.</p>\n<p>- Currently there are only a few enemy types for each species, but more will be added in the future.</p>\n<p>- World events and more random objects/enemies/npcs are planned, in order to give the galaxy a more \"inhabited\" feel and give players increasingly interesting interactions.</p>\n<p>- A respawn minigame is in development but not implemented yet.</p>\n<p>- Currently everything except the upgrade and refining station are procedurally spawned. There is currently a world border, but plans on a larger procedural generation method in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/897/8970d426d4812157a20de6b854bba8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Neonpe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
