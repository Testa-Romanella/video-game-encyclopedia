Try to deliver all of your crates to the appointed destination before your oxygen tank runs out!\u00a0As you fulfill your orders and progress through the game, you will need to deliver more crates, maneuver through more densely packed fishes, and find additional crates lost on the ocean floor!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>W, A, S, D</strong> to orient your ship</li><li><strong>J</strong> to thrust</li><li><strong>K</strong> to throw crates</li><li><strong>Esc</strong> to go back to the main menu</li></ul>\n<p>All of the\u00a0crates must be detached from your ship into the destination site in order to proceed to the next level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game\u00a0Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>You don't need to deliver all of the crates at once!</li><li>Remember that your arrow indicators point to where you need to go.</li><li>You can use your submarine as a barrier to protect the crates from the fishes! Tilt up for maximum surface area.</li><li>If you are low on oxygen, you can go back to the base or destination building to replenish it before attempting to retrieve the crates again.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Note*</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The <strong>web version</strong> of the game is submitted <strong>post deadline</strong> as an additional build for players to enjoy. The only difference is that\u00a0It's built using an older version of the Love2D framework due to technical constraints and will be less stable as a result.</li><li>The original submission of the game uses a scaled up 160px x 140px aspect ratio. While this should still be\u00a0acceptable as per the rules (<em><strong>You are allowed to scale to viewport, but must keep the aspect ratio</strong></em>),\u00a0this makes the game appears smoother than it would be on a gameboy.<ul><li>As recommended by the discord community, we uploaded another build which it strictly respects the 160px x 140px resolution.
