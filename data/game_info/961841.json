(Titch)", "description": "<p>Inspired by Upgrade Complete, This game is a tribute to anyone who has ever sat there playing a game doing the same repeatable set of actions in order to get a arbitrary number to go up. It&#39;s a game about exploration, amnesia and collecting. Every action is will give you experience; You can gain levels in just about everything you do, from Jumping to Taking Damage to standing still and doing nothing at all. The world is sandbox, you can go anywhere you like as long as you level up enough. There is a catch though. Every night a re-occurring nightmare will rob you of everything if you can&#39;t survive it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-05T13:35:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81e/81ed3107ee8b97455cad1744b01194f8.jpg", "website": "https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/519030", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
