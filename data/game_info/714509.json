The player can choose to take on any area of the game at any time in any order. Defeating bosses will grant the player a new weapon and increase the player's maximum weapon energy. However, the player is not the only one to get more powerful with each boss defeated. All enemies will increase in power level, this effects their health and damage but also their behavior. Enemies become smarter as the game progresses!<br/><br/>Not only do enemies become more difficult but the stage hazards do as well. Hazards will deal more damage, have altered behavior and generally are faster and tougher to deal with. So tackling different areas of the game at different points of progression can yield a very different experience for the player. On top of all that, bosses also power up similarly to enemies. So the order in which you fight the bosses will matter a lot in terms of difficulty. With this system, the game won't get easier as you progress like a lot of similarly non-linear action games do.<br/><br/>These features also allow for great replayability!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T03:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4d/e4d6f4c856a83da6e06cf18e1d374948.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tyler M Richardson"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tyler M Richardson"], "esrb_rating": null}
