We do so throughtout our own legal or illegal\u00a0decisions to actions which show every now and then on the map. Hovewer this is not a task for only one human being and therefore we need help from our followers, who give us money to being able to react and make meaningful upgrades which will help us on our way to save our planet!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Backstory:</strong></p>\n<p>We are an activist scientist from the largest American transportation organization in the world, Logistics, Inc., which work is to investigate the global pollution of the planet, and in the last report we found that large parts of the planet are becoming extremely polluted. As a good employee, we told our boss to publish this news. However, he immediately dismissed it and explained to us that it was unacceptable and that he would certainly not release such negative news to the media. Subsequently, he ordered us to edit this report for better results so that Logistics, Inc. would not be tarnished by a good corporate name. This outraged us so much that we decided to do something about it ourselves and started our own top secret organization, Green, Inc., through which we try to influence and reverse the fall of humanity and the end of the world as we know it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T09:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/5895d8c65e2594b30958265f15445112.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ecostrat"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
