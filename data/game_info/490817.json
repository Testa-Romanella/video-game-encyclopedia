Where there are many zombies, play the survivor of zombie virus, fight side by side with other players, and take part in the intense self-defense counterattack to defeat the enemy<br/>\n<br/>\r\n*Support local 4 people in one screen game<br/>\r\n*Each level can upgrade weapons or attributes<br/>\r\n*5 optional roles, 10 different weapons, 13 checkpoints contain unique enemies, and well-designed boss war<br/>\r\n*1-2 hours of game time<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI like the Top Down shooting game very much, but the existing games need a lot of time to collect equipment and upgrade, so I can't play with my friends who took part in the game, so I made this game, which is characterized by being frank and ready to start a game with my friends at any time.<br/>\r\nOf course, this is also the shortcoming of this game. There are no long-term items and no archives. If you like collecting, then this game will disappoint you. However, if you want to have a frank shoot and a shoot with your friends, then this game will definitely suit you.<br/>\r\nhard core, some BOSS checkpoints are still difficult and require a little skill.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis game only supports playing with the controller, because it is made independently, I have only tested the controllers of xbox and ps (please understand)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T20:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/426/426c946ae5a0bf9fe4f57deb42df7ff4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YANG WEN JUN"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YANG WEN JUN"], "esrb_rating": null}
