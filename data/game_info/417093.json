A multitude of Easter eggs and takeoffs on the good games of old.<br/><br/>Good luck to everyone who decides to play this game. May merciful Svetodar help you!<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0This demo is 5-7 hours long and covers first 40% of the game, which is designed to take around 15-20 hours to fully beat it, through a curious player might find themselves spend much more time unraveling the game's secrets. The full game will be released on 17th March 2020. The English translation is still being carefully polished, so there might be some minor spelling errors (nothing game-breaking though).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b3/6b35dee98908f3f40103969d06c23ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kirillkrm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
