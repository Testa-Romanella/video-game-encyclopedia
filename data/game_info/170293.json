May contain programmer art.</p><p>Forest Hecate is a level based game where you must use collected and cooked flowers from objects such as trees to defeat enemies and win levels, along with avoiding various objects or entities that may come in your way. There are multiple different levels and bosses with different ways of winning, though I was not able to complete many levels due to time.</p><p>All levels are unlocked and accessible via the main menu by default, but you must win a level in order to fight it's boss.</p><p>I did a lot of difficulty adjusting, so hopefully the difficulty is not too hard or too easy. Difficulty varies a lot between levels/bosses.</p>Tools/languages used:<p>Eclipse / Java / Slick2D / LWJGL / Gimp / Debian</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e7829542d5c43bb5255bb581b92648d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["jordanb84"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
