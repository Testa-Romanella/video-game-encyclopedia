{"id": 4962, "slug": "shank", "name": "Shank", "name_original": "Shank", "description": "<p>Shank, the first game in the series of its name, is defined by its comic-book visual style and graphic violence in the vein of Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. In the single-player mode, the game follows a story of a revenge. The player assumes the control of Shank, who used to be a mafia hitman before they killed his only love, Eva. He goes on a vendetta after her murderers, hunting them down and killing in brutal ways. There&#39;s also a cooperative mode that features a different plot, something of a prequel to the main storyline. In co-op, Shank and the other playable character, Falcone, have to save a strip model from a gang of bikers and fix a rigged wrestling match.<br />\nThe game is played as a fast-paced 2D side-scroller. Shank uses three types of weapons: a firearm, a melee weapon, such as a chainsaw, and two daggers. All three should be used interchangeably to create a variety of combo movements, which are essential to master before you reach the late stages of the game. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked. Shank can also perform a number of acrobatic tricks and other movements, such as throwing enemies or jumping on them, which makes for a varied gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 67, "released": "2010-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:47:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c80/c8050355992f431d0efd10a19630b6ea.jpg", "website": "https://www.klei.com/games/shank", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 108, "owned": 2083, "beaten": 335, "toplay": 45, "dropped": 123, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 367, "suggestions_count": 340, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 370, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
