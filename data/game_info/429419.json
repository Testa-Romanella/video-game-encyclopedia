D. Salinger, and published in 1951, is about a boy named\u00a0Holden Caulfield and his 'journey'.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a young Holden Caulfield, who seeks redemption by saving children in the fields. The gameplay mainly consists of using the <strong>ARROW KEYS</strong> to move Holden as he dashes left to right in an attempt to save as many children as possible. Whenever you fail to save a poor, innocent soul, your own life will be broken bit by bit. You have three life points to spare, but note that this game is accurate to real life: you can't save everyone.</p>\n<p>What you CAN do is keep moving forward. You can also catch falling records in order to increase your character's motivation and health, making it so you can save those children!</p>\n<p>If you want the gameplay experience to be even more immersive, we've created a playlist with songs that'll 'enhance the experince' of gameplay.</p>\n<p>Here's the link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUZcam7E6 pD2tb5x8 dywhJJjV59Vu_ji5</p>\n<p>Let us know in the comments how well you do! This was just a simple-made test project, but any information about glitches/feedback is still highly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! - Blank_Sans</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Publisher: Joshua Kerr</p>\n<p>Programmer: Jake Shonts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T09:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/6727c3c4ea3f06beba1dda15d3fcc3d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blank Brothers Productions"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
