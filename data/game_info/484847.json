It turns out that a composition of its atmosphere is similar to Earth's, and it could be suitable for humans. However existing space technologies do not allow reaching the planet in the near future.<br/></li><li><strong>2049 a.d.</strong> A meteorite consisting of an unknown mineral hits the Earth. Its shape and internal structure suggests that its nature is artificial, so it is probably a fragment of some extraterrestrial object. Attention of scientists is drawn to extremely unusual properties of the crysterite, as they called the mineral: it can create \"warps\", or hyperspace rifts. The first teleporters have been constructed, and then, a bit later, an experimental hyperspace engine for an insterstellar spacecraft. However it is one of a kind, due to extreme shortage of crysterite. Thorough search for the precious mineral is immediately initiated. Finally, traces are found in an emission spectrum of the exoplanet discovered two years ago. There are no doubts in the decision to send an expedition to the planet.<br/></li><li><strong>2050 a.d.</strong> A spaceship equipped with the hyperspace engine, with scientists, builders, security guards, necessary equipment and materials onboard, makes its way to the planet, to found a colony. People successfully land on the planet, build a base, discover crysterite mines and start their development. Six months have passed according to a plan, the first shipment of the mineral is about to be sent back to Earth, but suddenly the communication with the Colony has been interrupted.</li></ul>The immense crysterite amounts at the Colony resulted in vast teleportation network throughout the base - but it was not the case for Earth. The only physical connection with the colony is an emergency input teleporter; the output counterpart is located at the Colonial base. Its low capacity only allows sending a small amount of vital cargo... or one fully equipped soldier - you.<br/>You, as an experienced space marine, get an important task: go to the exoplanet through the emergency teleporter and find out what has happened to the Colony. Most likely you also have to find the spaceship - a fortified citadel - and try to reestablish the uplink. You don your favourite armour, take your trusty army knife, and bravely step into the teleporter with the desire for glorious adventures.<h3>Sources of Inspiration</h3>We do love classic old-school 3D-shooters. The development of <strong>Perilous Warp</strong> was inspired by such masterpieces as Quake, Unreal, Doom III, and certainly the brilliant game Chasm: The Rift. Old school players will discover numerous references, but even if you are not in your thirties yet - rest assured that you won't be bored!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T17:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/459/45924a5be4f1327c12e24cfb7a8e461b.jpg", "website": "https://crystice.com/perilous-warp/", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 12, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 423, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Crystice Softworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Crystice Softworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
