Help her and her cronies run, jump, slide, and shoot their way to a stronger, and more stable leadership. Wreak havoc on the poor, help the elite, and be as naughty as possible in those wheat fields. With your help Maybot can defeat the coalition of chaos; morality and hope, bringing back the wealth to the elite few and condemning the many to ordinary working poverty. There are girl's jobs and boy's jobs but this is definitely a bot's job.</p>\n<p><em>This game is based on true events that may or may not have happened by people who may or may not be real.</em></p>\n<p><strong>For more information:</strong> Visit the Maybot Run website and for instructions on how to play the game go to the Maybot Run online instruction manual.</p>\n<p><strong>#MaybotRun</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Minimum System Requirements (Windows PC):\u00a0</strong>Windows 7 or higher.\u00a0Intel Core\u2122 Duo or faster. 2GB of RAM or more.
