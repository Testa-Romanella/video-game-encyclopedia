In the Valley of Kings, the tombs lay defiled, despoiled of all treasure.  All but one.  One tomb had remained impervious to looting.  A tomb of a nameless king of an age lost to history.  Not one would-be thief who had ever challenged its depths had  returned. The Treasure Hunter was determined to be the first.  When he stood before the entrance to the tomb, half buried in sand, he had expected difficulty getting inside.  To his surprise, the ancient stone gate rose open under its own power like a gaping maw.  An open invitation.  Perhaps this would be easier than he thought.\r\n <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Tomb of the Devourer</strong> is a standalone <strong>Diorama Dungeoncrawl</strong> Module.\u00a0 Delve into an ancient tomb, fight monsters, avoid deadly traps, and attempt to steal the fabled treasure of the Tomb of the Devourer.</p>\n<p><strong>Genre: </strong>Action-Adventure</p>\n<p><strong>Length: </strong>~30-60 minutes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T14:57:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db3/db3dba1e349a34f1772c958fda407150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tales of the Renegade Sector"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
