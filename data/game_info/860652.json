{"id": 860652, "slug": "scp-advanced", "name": "SCP Advanced", "name_original": "SCP Advanced", "description": "<p>SCP Advanced is a retro styled SCP interaction simulator. SCPs are anomalous objects that are being contained by the SCP Foundation. You play as a Class-D personal, a death row inmate used in experiments.</p>\n<p>The SCP Foundation has given you access to around 30 SCPs to interact with. The goal is not to win, but rather to see what each SCP does. To begin, enter the correct SCP number to enter the containment cell of your desired SCP. Keep in mind that you only have access to a select few. </p>\n\n<p>Happy testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Button lustra ctlux bowl(3layer, filter)2.wav\u00a0by\u00a0suonho\u00a0on freesound.com, license\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>creepy cavern sfx.wav\u00a0by\u00a0Karma-Ron\u00a0on freesound.com, license\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</p>\n<p>Typewriter snippet 02\u00a0by\u00a0cabled_mess\u00a0on freesound.com,\u00a0license\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</p>\n<p>AM radio static\u00a0by\u00a0RobertMThomas\u00a0on freesound.com, license\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</p>\n<p>'Horror Music' and 'Before Dawn' by Jason Shaw on AudionautiX, music has been trimmed.\u00a0license\u00a0https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T18:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7a/e7a2f73adfb56e8469ea9f2e39067fb8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lance Ritola"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
