Only difference between the two is that the windows build allows pausing the game with Esc.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:28:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ojaoweir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
