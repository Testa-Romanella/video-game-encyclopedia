Some towers can stall the bloons and give the other towers more time to pop them by freezing and gluing the bloons. Money is gained by popping bloons, completing rounds, and collecting bananas from existing banana farms which can be spent on new towers, upgrades for existing ones, or temporary items such as exploding pineapples and road spikes. so enjoy my remake</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T08:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1a975f963302f4e794435a4ce33f4a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zmall"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
