It features a player tasked with running around a supermarket in search of particular items, listed on the right side. Use WASD to move, hold E while nearby to collect the desired item, and use LShift to dash forward. Tasks can be skipped (with a cool down) by clicking the \"skip task\" button. The harder tasks give you more points per item. Try and get the highest score within the time limit!</p>\n\n<p>Sprites provided by Poloviiinkin</p>\n<p>https://poloviiinkin.itch.io/food<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:53:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/11483bbbae73553acbec0efb3cfb93e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fun177"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
