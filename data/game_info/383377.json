The game follows the stories of Terra, an Elder Earthborn landkeeper, and Nova, a youthful Starborn inventor as they explore their respective environments and interact with the people in their communities. Their two worlds collide after a mysterious spacecraft crash-lands in Earthborn territory and Terra is asked to investigate. Nova, in the meantime, is separated from the rest of his people and must navigate an alien world to find them. Players must explore unique environments and interact with interesting characters to uncover mysteries of the past.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Development Team</strong></p>\n<p>Maize Longboat\u00a0\u2013 Creative Director, Producer<br/>Mehrdad Dehdashti\u00a0\u2013 Technical Director<br/>Ray Caplin\u00a0\u2013 Artist, Animator<br/>Beatrix Moersch\u00a0\u2013 Sound Designer<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Generously Supported by</strong></p>\n<p>Initiative for Indigenous Futures<br/>Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace<br/>Hexagram Network<br/>Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada<br/>Department of Communication Studies, Concordia University<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Special thanks to</strong></p>\n<p>Obx Laboratory for Experimental Media<br/>Technoculture, Art and Games Research Centre<br/>mLab<br/>Grand River Post Secondary Education Office<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T05:28:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/05a/05a249539227218cb1701a38976cf38b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SlipCycle"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
