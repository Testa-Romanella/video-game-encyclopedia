One evening you recieve a weird task, you have to save Dracula, and also he is now vegan.</p>\r\nThe game was made in five days during the Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2. Everything but the music (two songs that are full of copyright)\u00a0was made during the jam using Unity, Photoshop and Audacity. Sadly i can't get it working propperly on web browser so i uploaded the dev version, and because of that you will see some error messages that you can close. Otherwise the windows build works smoothly, so don't heistate to download it.\r\n<p>A game by Alba Romero and Gabriel Ramiro,</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/arrhythmicboy/<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/alba_romomont/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:21:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8c3e46f60ef35ce5f9a77364bdf2c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ArrhythmicBoy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
