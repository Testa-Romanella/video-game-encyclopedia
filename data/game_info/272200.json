I am determined to continue on this project and this is between a bare bones prototype and something that could constitute as an alpha stage (hopefully in the next month). If you have any feedback please let me know in the comment below.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n<p>The player has health points and warp points. Warp points are gained by bouncing the ball. You use them to play card onto the field. The cards have numbers and names specifying how many warp point they need to be played and what there name is. If you hover over a card a description should pop up in the top left.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You can do \"critical hits\" by hitting the ball on the edge of your paddle.</p>\n\n<p>Plans for the next month:</p>\n<p>-Create tutorial.</p>\n<p>- Finish up core game play.</p>\n<p>-Finish coding and artwork for the 32 beginner cards.</p>\n<p>-Finish juicing up room i and designing it.</p>\n\n<p>Later on down the road:</p>\n<p>-Create/Design/Program a story line with more cards to collect.</p>\n<p>-Create challenge rooms with AI and different difficulty.</p>\n<p>-Possibly?: Network Multiplayer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f80/f80ed97b01ca301cb0234b10792f76b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RookTKO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
