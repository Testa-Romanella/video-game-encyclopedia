Connect the opposite sides of the same color by rotating the tiles. Each level is randomly generated, but guaranteed to be solvable.<h3>How to play</h3>You are challenged to bring order into the jumbled mix of lines and curves by connecting the opposite sides of the same color. Clicking a tile in the grid rotates the lines and curves in it. Colors will follow the lines.<br/><br/><br/>You may need to find spots to cross the lines or build loops.<h3>It's random!</h3>Each level is randomly generated, so solving even a small grid can vary wildly between being quite straight-forward to being a real challenge!<br/><br/>Only one thing is for sure: there is at least one solution for ALL of the shown levels. That's a promise!<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Multiple grid sizes and numbers of lines to connect<br/></li><li>Share levels solved or as a challenge with your friends<br/></li><li><strong>Endless random levels await being solved</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-04T04:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1f25f4da13068c7c2027d753014acb.jpg", "website": "https://connected.taoth.app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Andreas Ammer"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Andreas Ammer"], "esrb_rating": null}
