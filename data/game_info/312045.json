It is my first game in two years, so please be gentle with the feedback :P</p>\r\nWhat to do\r\n<p>You are a fish swimming around in a pond. Your goal is to catch as big a human as possible! You can do this by casting your bait out of the water and onto the land<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>W, S, A, D:</strong> makes the fishy swim around</p>\n<p><strong>Space: </strong>makes the fishy stop swimming around</p>\n<p><strong>Right click: </strong> (hold and release) casts your bait<br/></p>\r\nEncounters\r\n<p>When you encounter a human biting onto your bait, you will see a flashing screen saying \"ENCOUNTER!\".</p>\n<p>If you click the \"Decline\" button you will go back to the pond and await your next encounter.</p>\n<p>If you click the \"Accept\" button you will attempt to catch the human. This will take you to the Encounter screen.</p>\n<p>On the Encounter screen you need to fill the catching bar by spamming the <strong>Space</strong> key. Follow the prompts at the top, otherwise you might miss out on getting a really nice catch!</p>Thank you<p>Dmitry Timofeev for making the Pixelation Unity Asset<br/></p><p>Public Pool for making the two songs I used in my game:</p><ul><li>Puzzle Town</li><li>Con L\u00edmon</li></ul>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Any feedback is welcome.
