The only thing you know is your name. You look around you in this room to find a note left on the desk in the corner, and when you pick up the note, thats when you notice the blood stains. The note is a hastily written message from someone who seems to know who you are, and claims he erased your memories for your own good. They won't be able to find you that way. Play through the game to find out if Amelia makes it out alive.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fef7ef45f32c15efd591b837e8fde063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["acs14890"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
