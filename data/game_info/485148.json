I present you Polycalypse: Last bit of hope which is a zombie survival game with dismemberment system inspired by Resident Evil 2 Remake. Idea is that zombies try to kill you with every limb they have, until you shoot them in the head or break their skull with a melee weapon. The game will feature almost unique car upgrading/repairing mechanic where you replace car parts by manually placing them under the hood. This mechanic will be also used for building traps, upgrading static weapons and turrets, etc..", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T22:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9a604ffd8153a1e9acac73d78395680.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bachosoft Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bachosoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
