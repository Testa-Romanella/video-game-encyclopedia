Combine them, and enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As an <strong>apprentice witch</strong>, you are tasked to watch the Forge of your Master, a whimsical place of <strong>chaos and power</strong>. Everything is going well when suddenly, a hord of ice creatures break the door and try\u00a0to destroy the source of your power. To defend it, you can count on your <strong>magic</strong> and build your own army with the objects that surrounds you. Fight the waves and survive with your <strong>golems</strong> to protect the Forge!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This project<em>\u00a0is a </em><strong>student vertical slice</strong><em> done in 4 month within the ENJMIN. The demo shows the core mechanics of the game in an arena-type level.<br/> As a bonus, we added an infinite mode where waves never stop, and a playground mode where you can design the most marvelous golems!</em></p>\n<p><em>Cobble &amp; Trouble</em> is a<em><strong> first-person</strong> action</em>\u00a0game. Imagine a blend of COD Zombies and\u00a0 a tower defense. But unlike tower-defense, the focus is on improvisation and action and unlike COD Zombies, it's in a fantasy <strong>world of witches</strong>. You, as a witch, can use magical, telekinetic powers to create chaos, fend-off enemies, and craft an army of golems that fight for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GAME DESIGN /\u00a0</strong>Hugo DUNAS-WALD (Pitcher - itch) -\u00a0Ronan HOUZE\u00a0 -\u00a0Ulysse ROUAULT-LELIEVRE</p>\n<p><strong>ART</strong> /\u00a0Meryem ERIKCI (3D\u00a0Animator\u00a0&amp; Light\u00a0Artist - website)\u00a0-\u00a0Romane GARCIA\u00a0 (Concept &amp;\u00a0Environment\u00a0Artist -\u00a0website\u00a0) -\u00a0Ana\u00efs RIFF (VFX\u00a0Artist - website)</p>\n<p><strong>PROGRAMMING\u00a0/\u00a0</strong>Baptiste PREVOST -\u00a0S\u00e9bastien VIOLIER</p>\n<p><strong>SOUND DESIGN</strong> /\u00a0Benjamin DARMON</p>\n<p><strong>MANAGEMENT</strong> /\u00a0Quentin BORDES -\u00a0Tim HOFFMAN</p>\n<p><strong><strong>UX/UI/UR\u00a0</strong></strong>/\u00a0Paul EYHERAMOUNO (website)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T03:06:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff61f5897e215b43368e1e63e8dd7e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lutwidge", "Alterisateur", "razeltif", "Shakastrai", "Romane Garcia", "Paul \"BoJack\" Eyheramouno", "DrChat", "riffanais", "timdhoffmann", "cobbleandtrouble"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
