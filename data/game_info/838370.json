Like a genetic algorithm, it creates some spells, sees\u00a0which are the most powerful, and generates more like them. Only, how is it going to get the data to determine which spells are the best?</p>\n<p>That's where you come in - you are tasked with testing the lethality of the Librarian's spells against a never-ending horde of goblins. Each spell has a randomly generated set of attributes (power, speed, cooldown, aim, trajectory, etc) based on the attributes of the most powerful spell you have equipped. Old weak spells will be thrown away and replaced with new powerful spells.</p>\n<p>Collaborate with this AI to see which spell is the best - or blind yourself trying.</p>\n\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>midjourney AI for title screen and robot art.</p>\n<p>Goblin01 - DancingEyebrows https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/goblin01-188119\u00a0</p>\n<p>48 Particle Effect Pack - GAPH https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/48-particle-effect-pack-13998\u00a0</p>\n<p>Battle Wizard Poly Art - Dungeon Mason https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/battle-wizard-poly-art-128097</p>\n<p>Gobin Darts - The mysterious man who lives in the stairwell\u00a0https://bit.ly/3zVXF00</p>\n<p>Low Poly Rocks - SnowFiend Studios https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/lowpoly-rocks-137970\u00a0</p>\n<p>Handpainted Grass &amp; Ground Textures - Chromisu\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/handpainted-grass-ground-textures-187634</p>\n<p>Free Trees - ADA_KING https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/free-trees-103208</p>\n<p>B\u00e9zier Path Creator - Sebastian Lague https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082</p>\n<p>Fantasy Wooden GUI : Free - Black Hammer https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/fantasy-wooden-gui-free-103811</p>\n<p>XP, Inventory, and Book sprites - Inventory Master\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/inventory-master-ugui-26310\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d06/d06b64f3a8a9f4e898ac1fbee61e5ef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Bim!", "TaylorGwynn", "McDichael", "Thomas Goos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
