You can, however, remember your name.<br/>-What is your name?-</p>\n\n\n<p>This is just a demo. I made it to see if making text games with Python is fun.

Please please use something else to make a game if you are interested in that kind of thing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:45:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59b/59b738d2a6ee29ee7971d840d448d559.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["j_beavis"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
