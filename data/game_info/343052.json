Being a huge fan of Stardew Valley and relaxing life simulation games, I wanted a frantic version of that type of game that would reward players for following their own unique unconscious pattern of crop production. The hit boxes are extremely janky, but the general idea is there and represented in the gameplay. If I were to continue this idea, I would make it a grid-based movement system and end with a picture of the player created pattern and their score, both enforcing the idea of patterns in the daily life of the player. My main takeaway is that everything impacts how player perceive and play a game, even small changes of time can affect the entire feeling of the entire experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T04:00:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb153b12111dfb72c50cf729fbafd38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["John Wanamaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
