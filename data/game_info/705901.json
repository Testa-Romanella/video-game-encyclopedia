You need to avoid portals and spikes and the aim is to get the best high score. You can play either on web or you can download the game on windows.</p>\n<p>The game was entirely designed by one person (me!) which shows particularly in the art style. The core aspect of the design is that the game creates\u00a0randomly generated levels of varying sizes for the user to play. Levels were meticulously tested and using various algorithms and logic, any level generated is able to be completed.</p>\n<p>If I had more time to work on the game, or if I wanted to develop it further here are the list of improvements:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0music (I really struggled to think of a suitable theme)</li><li>Xephos pixel art (looks a bit weird)</li><li>overall look in general (maybe, keep the pixel art theme)</li><li>moving traps or enemies</li><li>gamemodes</li><li>unlockable skins (other Yogscast duos like Pedguin and Boba, Duncan and Ravs, Osie and Bouphe etc.)</li></ul>\n<p>If you like the game or have a suggestion/criticism\u00a0then let me know I would love some feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/79958085201d9fdd4d2d40a1905e0e29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ShyamB"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
