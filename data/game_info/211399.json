To launch the ball, click in the game window, you can also move the ball and paddle with the arrow keys, <strong>BEFORE</strong><strong> </strong>you launch the ball to get the angle at which you want to shot.\u00a0 Note:\u00a0<em>The ball will always launch at about a 45 degree angle to the right</em>. In this game you have 3 lives.</p><p>In order to win, you must hit all of the bricks with the ball by having it bounce off of the paddle and walls. You have as many hits as you want, but if the ball hits the ground\u00a0 below the paddle,\u00a0you lose a life and get to keep going. When you run out of lives, your game will automatically restart with all the bricks back in their original position.</p><p>Have fun and I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5998526aaeaaf735f017f1eddfafe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben.Farris"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
