While it might seem like a simple game, basketball at the NBA level is an ever-evolving phenomenon. To some, pro basketball is all about an image - how you look on the court and how good you look when playing. To others, the NBA game is all about speed - crossing over a flat-footed defender and initiating the fast break for the finishing slam. In basketball, it takes offensive precision and determined defense to capture the victory, and no video game takes all the excitement and realism of the NBA to the next level quite like ESPN NBA Basketball.</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "2003-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-25T17:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f2b/f2bcb34a6a43d77a11032e7d8f9c211a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Visual Concepts"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
