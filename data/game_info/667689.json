Bonus cards may help save the day by undoing the effects of the penalty or providing extra energy or score boosts.<h3>Results</h3> <br/>Who scored best? Who gained/lost the most? <br/>Knowledge isn\u2019t enough to win the game: get ready for surprises!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are two game modes:<br/><br/><ul><li>Open play: you play with connected players.</li></ul><ul><li>Private play: you play with friends.</li></ul><br/>And if you're alone, challenge our bots! They will be waiting for you in the waiting room.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Malus cards</h3>When in team mode, coordination and cooperation will be your strengths: your team should act as one, all players must agree on the same malus card for each opponent team.<h3>Energy levels</h3>Did you really think that malus cards came without a price? Each malus card costs you energy. Each time you use a malus card, your energy level will go down, and the worse the penalty, the higher the cost. You'll have to put in place some strategies concerning energy usage... so, to malus or not to malus, that's the question!<h3>Bonus cards</h3>In each round, you can counter-attack with bonus cards.<br/>There are three types of bonus cards:<br/><ul><li>Shields: these cancel out malus effects, allowing you to answer more easily.</li></ul><ul><li>Energy: these will either increase your energy level or decrease your opponents\u2019 levels.</li></ul><ul><li>Points: these will add points to your final score or remove points from your opponents\u2019 scores.</li></ul><h3>Gifts</h3>Depending on how you played, you may be given gifts.
