Arcade Edition, is now available for only $1.99! It has new modes, match customization, and 20 unlockable outfits.\r\n<p>This game was created for both BGSjam9 and Ludum Dare 38. The theme for the former was \"single button input\" and the latter's was \"It's a small world\", so I made a game featuring the technology that made the world smaller through the press of a single button - the telegraph!</p>\n<p>Up to 4 players can cheer along with Samantha using their telegraphs. When she yells \"gimme a B!\", respond by entering in the real Morse code for the letter B. Compete against your friends, or try the single-player survival mode and see how long you can keep up - cheerleading is a demanding sport, after all.</p>\n<p><em>**To play multiplayer survival mode, call SOS on the title screen (. . . _ _ _ . . .)**</em></p>\n<p>Some keyboards don't allow certain keys to be pressed at the same time. If there are any conflicts, the Q, C, N, and O keys can also be used for the 4 players respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>2/12/18 Patch Details:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Changed rules so that 1st player to match a letter gets 2 points, and every other player gets 1 point - matches now play to 15 points instead of 11</li><li>Replaced telegraph beeps</li><li>Added new Samantha animations</li><li>Replaced hype meter\u00a0with one that fills from left to right</li><li>Added Impostor Cat Games intro and random letter disclaimer</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>TJ Cordes (me): programming/art</p>\n<p>Toby Sid John: music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a8c88900b0b045b0ac32492e55ffc74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
