Be mindful!<br/>As you become comfortable with the game, why don't you challenge winning the championship!<br/><br/>Good to know:<br/>\u2022 With regular size meat, your tail will grow by one step.<br/>\u2022 You will grow larger if you have larger meat.<br/>\u2022 You will shrink with poisonous fungus. But, you can grow back with some meat.<br/>\u2022 If you get involved in bomb explosion, your tail will shrink back to original length.<br/>\u2022 If you use your tail on bombs, they may explode. Better to push them away instead.<br/>\u2022 You can sweep the mushrooms off with your tail. But you can also throw the meats away at the same time, so be sensible in the use of that capability.<br/>\u2022 Some area of ground will sink as time passes. There will be more frequent battles because of that.<br/>\u2022 You will get a new skin, if you attain higher rank or meet other conditions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T03:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecf/ecf16448284610fec467d39a9b2fde20_BgYhvdh.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["PONOS"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["PONOS"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
