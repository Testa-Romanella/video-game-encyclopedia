It is a simple game where the primary aspect is a tool that generates a cave. The menu has some settings to change that affect multiple parts of the generation process, which uses an algorithm called Cellular Automata.</p>\n<p>There is a small gameplay loop - collect the keys and climb the ladder. This generates a new dungeon but the menu opens as well so the user can change any settings they desire.\u00a0The little gameplay aspects that exist are the torches (including the equippable one, changed by Spacebar), which give off light that increases the player's sanity. When the sanity gets under 50%, one of three 4th-wall breaking effects can happen. They are either a fake blue screen of death, inverted controls, or not showing the light from the equippable torch (it still raises sanity). An effect can happen only once per 5 seconds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad7/ad7c409a1360eda3152957d0c289bf05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
