{"id": 4523, "slug": "red-faction-armageddon", "name": "Red Faction: Armageddon", "name_original": "Red Faction: Armageddon", "description": "<p>Armageddon - the fourth part of the game Red Faction.<br />\nThe action takes place on Mars. Mars is colonised and inhabited thoroughly, but the device for creating an artificial atmosphere is captured by a group of unbalanced scoundrels. Colonists have to move under the surface, where for some reason there is air.<br />\nThis is a setting. We meet the hero pursuing his own tasks - he is looking for treasure in a dungeon under someone else&#39;s order. But instead of gold and gems, he discovers a device of an incomprehensible purpose. The hero contacts the customer and receives an order to blow up the found structure. The explosion leads to the awakening of a race of monsters, like giant insects, which begin to briskly destroy the colonists. And the hero now has to kill the monsters.<br />\nArmageddon sets a new level of the Red Faction game. The important novelties:<br />\nMore opportunities to break through the walls.<br />\nThe hero gains additional energy from destroying something.<br />\nThe hero gets a device that can collect back the destroyed objects.<br />\nSometimes the hero finds a fighting robot, sits down in it and literally tramples the enemies.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2011-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T22:32:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/395/395ad028483d6cd9076b746a3eec993d.jpg", "website": "http://www.redfaction.com/", "rating": 3.03, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 232, "owned": 3584, "beaten": 252, "toplay": 50, "dropped": 150, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 117, "ratings_count": 394, "suggestions_count": 699, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 394, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Volition", "THQ"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
