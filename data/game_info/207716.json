This was created for a project at school. The aim was to make a game based on a music subculture without the negativity within that subculture. At the end you recieve a code for a free drink at any shop. This is because the game was made to be played at a music event and the code does not work in real life so do not attempt to use it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2df5f8b7a9593f0b4ac0cd0ee3a270f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oojmflip"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
