This is an interactive flocking simulation where you can play around with different parameters and see how it affects the flying boids. Experiment with different combinations or add in obstacles to guide the boids, and have fun!</p>\r\nHOW TO OPERATE\r\nAlignmentAffects the force of\u00a0each boid steering toward the average direction of its flock neighbors.<br/>CohesionAffects the force of each boid steering toward the average position of its flock neighbors.SeparationAffects the force of each boid avoiding its flock neighbors.SpeedAffects the speed with which each boid moves.Neighbor RadiusAffects the size of the circle's radius\u00a0around each boid that it will detect and react to neighbors.Active ToggleToggles that specific flock on and off.Left Mouse ButtonClick to add a circle obstacle for the boids to avoid, click it again to remove it.Delete ObstaclesDeletes every user-created obstacle on the screen.\r\nABOUT\r\n<p>This flocking simulation was made as a final project for a Computer Graphics course. The original idea of a flocking simulation was created by Craig Reynolds with his simulation program\u00a0Boids by employing 3 simple rules: alignment, cohesion, and separation. In nature, agents in a flock tend to move in the direction of its neighbors, move toward the center of its neighbors, and try to avoid its neighbors, so we can use those rules to create a simple simulation and adjust various parameters to visualize these adjustments in real time. We can add various other rules, such as obstacle avoidance (which I have added in this simulation) and goal seeking, among others, but these 3 rules make up the basis for a flock's behavior.</p>\n<p>This specific implementation was created with the assistance of a wonderful series found below with some added features to make it interactive and more detailed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:39:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a569bac4ccc77e01d91a1f3f607fb1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harrison Rooney"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
