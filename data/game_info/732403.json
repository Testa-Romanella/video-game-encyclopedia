You must survive between ambitious rulers dreaming of building an empire, treacherous neighbours that long to burn your kingdom, and the religion which always makes unreasonable demands. Survive and build your kingdom\u2019s legacy to last centuries.<br />\nHard, Yet Tender</p>\n<p>After drawing hard and straight outlines, we drew unique faces for our characters. Then we had them stand in front of solid color tone backgrounds and brought them to life with our in-house software. Behold! They laugh, rage, and tells us their stories with their chewy and tender movements.<br />\nTwo Game Modes</p>\n<p>In Scenario mode you will follow a character\u2019s story, while in Sandbox mode you can conquer the world without any restriction. Each mode is connected and will affect the other. Good choices and decisions from past games will lead your future plays to success.<br />\nFriend or Enemy?</p>\n<p>Neighbouring kingdoms remember your behaviour and will react to it. Critical mistakes bring dissent and lead to war. If you react according to a character\u2019s personality, they will open their mind.<br />\nAccusation</p>\n<p>In the 11th century, persons without faith were either barbarians beyond the borders, or heretics that were burned at stake. Every kingdom is under the influence of a religion, and will demand your kingdom prove their faith.<br />\nConspiracy &amp; Backroom Deals</p>\n<p>Every June, a meeting is held during which believers of each faith gather to condemn and denounce the others. Kingdoms will condemn one another, while religious leaders will stop a war or demand a crusade. You must do anything possible to turn the participants\u2019 opinion to your liking, including bribes, threats, and all kinds of dirty tricks.</p>\n<p>All will be forgiven in the name of God.<br />\nEasy Choices and Terrible Costs</p>\n<p>There are many choices before you start a war.

Or will you be burnt?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T04:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/307/307f1115911cf7522a0690decc49a966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PiedPipers Team"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["NEOWIZ"], "esrb_rating": null}
