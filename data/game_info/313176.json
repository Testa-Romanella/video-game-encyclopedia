Upon creating your clone army you realize that they have inherited your recreational habit of consuming live humans. Unfortunately however, they have decided that you are looking rather delicious. You decide to entertain this bit of sport for a while as you are also rather hungry and agree that your life is indeed, quite the delicacy.</p>\n<p>How To Play</p>\n<p>____________________</p>\n<p>* Eliminate clones either with melee or your ranged attack.</p>\n<p>* Eat / collect corpses and take them to a furnace to turn your clone bodies into live ammunition! (Beware that furnaces take a while to recharge after you use them. Use this ammo wisely or you'll be left with just your melee.</p>\n<p>* Don't let those nasty impostors touch you! You are far too delicious!</p>\n<p>* Survive for as long as possible while killing as many clones as you can.</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>____________________</p>\n<p>Quit:\u00a0\u00a0ALT-F4 or cut the power cable behind your PC.<br/></p>\n<p>Shoot:\u00a0\u00a0Left Mouse button.<br/></p>\n<p>Melee:\u00a0\u00a0Right Mouse button.</p>\n<p>Eat\u00a0 Corpses:\u00a0Space Bar.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6027aa11e1d201d1dc439a2c6fac0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Oblivion48"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
