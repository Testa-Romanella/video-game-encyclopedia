You play as Windir, an air mage who lives in a tower with many other mages.<br />\nThe most powerful of them is a fire mage and headmaster Dinyon. One day Dinyon get murder by a mysterious assassin. The guards quickly catch and kill him, however, right before death, he accuses Windir of arranging the murder. The guards catch you, but you manage to escape the tower. Now you have to solve the crime, find out who was behind the murder and prove yourself innocent.  </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Legend of Mysteria is a story-driven RPG, and unlike most other games in Labyronia series, it focuses much more on the puzzle-solving, exploration and interacting with NPCs rather than on battles. There are only a few fights in the game that are necessary to progress.<br />\nThere is also no leveling up system or character advancement aside from getting new equipment and items. The combat system is turn-based. The battle screen resembles of the early Dragon Quest games: you only see the enemies but not your team. In battles, you can perform physical attacks, block, use items or magic spells. The variety of magic spells depends on your equipment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:45:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34bbb7f3e6fb870477d70cf2b9c71932.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 1.78, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 51, "owned": 1109, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 45, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 45, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Labyrinthine"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["EQ Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
