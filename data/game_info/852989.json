Very addicting! Great to play whenever you have just a minutes of free time! Each hand can be played in 60-90 seconds!<br/><br/>Deal 4 cards... if the topmost card in a pile is of the same suit but lesser rank than the top card in another pile you can tap to remove it! Or tap a top card to move it to an open pile to free up those below it!<br/><br/>See if you can reach the max score of 48 cards removed (leaving only 'The 4 Aces')!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T08:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d44/d4452841d5af8d4f1f6036ed57035e7b_L3o5yEH.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kidd Coding"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Kidd Coding"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
