Aliens are everywhere and us ordinary humans are exotic now. As Earth opens its arms to embrace the influx of extraterrestrial tourism, alien-exclusive services become more and more prevalent. If you think waiting tables is boring, why not join us at Koluan\u2019s DINER, where the sky\u2019s the limit. (Yes, in all caps, it\u2019s more exotic.)\r\n</p>\n<p>It was literal, the \u201csky is the limit\u201d thing. A waiter at Koluan\u2019s DINER is expected to ride a unicycle on a tight rope to serve food twice the size of their head to aliens comfortably situated on top of mountain-high pillars. As if being a waiter isn\u2019t precarious enough\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>Well, you have gotten used to it, the balance, the height, the big appetite of weird-looking creatures. Still, anything would beat the guilt of wasting tons of food falling on God-knows-whose head. \u201cOne day\u201d, you thought to yourself, \u201cI would leave this hellish place and get a more stable job.\u201d But hey, there are still mouths to feed, and that unicycle isn\u2019t going to ride itself\u2026\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:44:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e03807a420de9b5693064fed94ffb323.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Team Bacon x Pogo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
