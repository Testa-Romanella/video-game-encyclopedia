The only catch: the robot runs on solar energy and must not stay down there too long, otherwise the light will go out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The color scheme and sounds seems to be a little off on the HTML version, so please download the game for a better experience.</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p>\n<p> Steer the small, bouncing drone into the pits and try to break open stones or the like and collect their materials by pressing the action button while you are next to them. Collect as many materials as you can and bring them back to the surface. The signs scattered everywhere show you the materials you need. Now press the action button again to deliver the required materials. The bar on the side shows you the remaining energy. Be careful not to let the small drone (ball?) stay underground for too long, otherwise it will be over. You will find torches on the way underground. You can light them up when you have at least a certain amount of energy left. The burning torches then act as a kind of checkpoint where you can recharge your batteries. Then it's much more relaxed than having to go back to the sun again and again, believe me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Move Left:\u00a0\u00a0\u2190, A, Q</li><li>Move Right:\u00a0\u2192, D, E</li><li>Fly:\u00a0\u2191, Space, W</li><li>Interaction: R, ENTER</li><li>Pause: Escape</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>some sounds and UI-Images:<ul><li>https://kenney.nl/</li></ul></li><li>some other images:<ul><li>https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik</li><li>https://www.flaticon.com/authors/flat-icons</li><li>https://www.flaticon.com/authors/octopocto</li><li>https://www.flaticon.com/authors/shmai</li></ul></li><li>a realy cool Shader:<ul><li>https://godotshaders.com/shader/vhs-and-crt-monitor-effect/</li></ul></li><li>a great source of inspiration for low poly modeling:<ul><li>https://www.youtube.com/c/Imphenzia</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:19:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a97/a97686c2724541bef4cb16c405939826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Marienkiffer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
