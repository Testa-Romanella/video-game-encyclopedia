Feel free to cast a vote my way!</p>\n\n<p>The rules of the jam were to create a game using two colors that has the theme of \"loop\". Play as a yo-yo that loops their string from obstacle to obstacle to reach the top of Toy-Tower.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0(look, it's you!)<br/></p>\n\n<p>You'll notice that this is just a one-level game. This initial version is actually the first game I've published, and there are many more things I would like to implement. Since the jam has a time limit, this is it for now unless it gains more interest.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>(unfortunately, some slick tricks were cut for time)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to collab, chat, or request any commissions!\u00a0 I can be reached at tiptoptomcat@gmail.com.\u00a0If you like what you play and want to see more from me, feel free to donate as well!</p>\n\n<p>All assets are original by me (TipTopTomCat) unless otherwise noted.\u00a0 All songs in this series were made using OpenMPT software, graphics with Aseprite, and programming done on Game Maker Studio 2.
