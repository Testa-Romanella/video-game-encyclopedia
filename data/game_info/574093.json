Sit still, and use the mouse cursor to trace your features as best you can. Take care to concentrate, since you won't know how well you did until you've pressed 'enter.' The slightest movement can throw the whole thing off... even if you move back into position, was it <em>really</em> where you were? And that's assuming you were drawing well to begin with!</p>\n<p>For those who are pleased with (or amused by) the end result, you can save your glorious portrait as a .BMP image.</p>\n<p>In addition to your artistic skills and depth perception, your monitor's current resolution will affect the end result. The game always adjusts itself to fit to the size of your computer monitor, and works on a maximum resolution of 3840 x 2160 at this time. On anything larger, the game will still take up the whole screen but you'll only be able to draw in a 3840 x 2160 area in the top left corner.</p>\n<p>Source code is included, mainly to allow others to increase the max screen resolution in the distant future. You'll need Multimedia Fusion 2 (or Clickteam Fusion 2.5) to open it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T07:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f136ee110e611d8ecb67d31b96686ea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scroungin' 4 Catsup"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
