You will play as a clich\u00e9 french character of the 20th century, you are lost in caves deep underground. You will have to eat everything you can find to fight against the creatures roaming the caves. Walking long distances will deplete your satiation and you will get weaker but faster. Eating a lot will make you more resilient and stronger but you will be slower.</p><p>This version contains some quick post-jam fixes that I made to correctly port the game to WebGL.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc7/bc70bf172fa5ce7fd9a38f2bdfaa0b02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xenation"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
