The city thrived and\u00a0 was more advanced than we could ever imagine. One day, the ruler of the city got into a fight with a neighbouring city, and he decided to wage war with them, if only he knew it was the greatest mistake of his life. The war kept on going for ages, soldiers were dying, and the people started to lose hope. At last, none of the cities won and both of them were destroyed. A few thousand years later, our hero was born out of nowhere. Now, it is his task to learn about the fight and enrich his knowledge. made for UGJ 2020. used https://forum.unity.com/threads/discontinued-unity-save-load-utility-free-save-a...\u00a0 the game is two dimensions like the theme(two)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T03:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23a79f1eefd2de3379b286d6e3de5658.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Itamar123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
