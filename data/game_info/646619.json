Everyone can start playing immediately without the need of a tutorial or any long introduction. The main goal and controls are easy explained. The varied stages, different character behaviours and many items result in a chaotic but controllable and tactical gameplay where everyone can have fun.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to play in local mode with friends, but it\u2019s also possible to play against an AI or online via programs like Parsec against your friends.<br/></p>\n\n<p>The playable game is still in an early stage of development. There'll be many more characters, stages and features to come in the future!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T04:14:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3a/b3adf24c18385e6c8399e4582bf27d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["byXToGo"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
