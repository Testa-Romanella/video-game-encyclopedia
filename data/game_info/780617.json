{"id": 780617, "slug": "runaway-river", "name": "Runaway River", "name_original": "Runaway River", "description": "<p>Runaway River is a single player, 3D, arcade-style infinite runner where the player must navigate their way through treacherous terrain tethered to a rampaging giant fish by a fishing line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While fishing, a creature bigger than you have ever seen suddenly bites on your line, dragging you and your boat along with it. Steer carefully to avoid hazardous terrain like rocks, spikes, and shipwrecks as you race down the river collecting treasure and necessary supplies to survive along the way. Something strange has taken place giving these creatures immense size and strength and unique abilities to challenge you as you try to make it to the end of the river.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After it gets to the end of a segment, the fish breaks free and disappears eager to start again. However, there is now a choice ahead to be made as a fork in the river appears, each with important supplies that you desperately need to survive. Which path will you take and is it the correct choice to lead you down the river to safety or will it prove more treacherous than the path before?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collect your powerup and gear up as another fish has just bit your line.These powerups can provide necessary repairs to your ship so you make it further down the river. Additionally, they may upgrade your ship being able to turn and navigate faster, or extend your fishing line giving you more room to make a decision (but watch out for fishtailing!). Strategically adapt to the river as it presents unique challenges along each section and every path you follow provides new opportunities for you to test your abilities as a captain. Keep trying to make it further down the river with more treasure as you try to tame both the beasts and the river itself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T12:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/2998db51230fc8c0c0b56cf559ab3914.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MilkTBoba"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
