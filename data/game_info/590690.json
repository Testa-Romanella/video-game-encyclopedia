A sound of fearful desperation amidst threatening halls. Do you follow the voice, or look for a way out? Enter the city, and make your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome voices cry for help, someone's whispering, shouting, talking to you, waiting, pushing you to find what's hidden in this empty town.<br/>\r\nExplore the back alleys and corridors of abandoned and trashed streets, buildings and stairs, leading you closer to the cry for help that's screaming for you to come.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nALLON3 is a surreal and atmospheric horror experience, that features 3D sound driven story. So many voices are guiding you, yet you are completely alone and abandoned. Find your way out, find out who's calling for help, who's whispering into your ears and what kind of place did you end up in in the first place.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T05:26:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cd2f062415a9d6fc6ce0533257f6964.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vidas Salavejus", "Matt Reeves", "Aaron Wise", "Ideation Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vidas Salavejus", "Trial By Fire Games", "Matt Reeves Production"], "esrb_rating": null}
