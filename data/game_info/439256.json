Prove your packing-skills in this small\u00a0puzzle game made for the Quarantine Jam. Start out with a few handpicked levels to learn the trade and crunch away on an endless number of different, challenging packing-task.\u00a0</p>Modes\r\n<p><strong>Puzzle mode:</strong> Take your time and use all available times to fully pack the given space. You can only access one level at a time and need to solve it before stepping up. Errors can be \"undone\" and you can pack as slow as you like.</p>\n<p><strong>Time mode:</strong> Race the clock! 30 seconds for every packing task. But beware: there is a score! Try to fit as many tiles as you can, again, again and again, to keep your score high.</p>How to play<p>Drag tiles from the right on to the given grid. Every sub-tile needs to be place-able, so no overlapping tiles or tiles sticking out of the grid. You can always re-arrange them and drop them back outside the grid. You can always mute all sounds inside the game. When starting out, try at least a few levels of puzzle mode before you step into time mode.</p>\n\n<p>Engine: Godot v3.2.1<br/>Assets and sounds: Kenney NL<br/>Music: RPG by Brandon Morris</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:37:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5de/5de9679bb7bfa2d94bdad9433b9ff8af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["kchnkrml"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
