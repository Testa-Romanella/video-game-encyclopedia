This games themes includes...</strong><br/><strong>Abuse</strong><br/><strong>Body Mutilation</strong><br/><strong>And Disturbing Imagery.</strong></p>\n<p>All the mentioned topics above are only implied in the game's context through symbolism and some minor dialogue so it never get's too graphic. But if your sensitive to these topics I highly suggest that you turn back now.</p>\n<p>:<strong>HISTORY:</strong><br/>Before we get into the main meat and potatoes of this project, I'd like to give y'all a short history lesson on the development of this game.<br/><br/>In the distant year of 2019 I started development on a squeal to my game Planet Stuck 2, this new game was appropriately named Planet Stuck 3. After 5 months of rigorous non-stop work I finished the expansive 10 hour game.<br/><br/>All was good in the world, until a shocking realization hit me like a truck. It was apparent that I had sacrificed quality for a tight development deadline the game was insanely unpolished and buggy. The mechanics and story though poorly executed were not all that bad.<br/><br/>So after that I was at a crucial fork in the road, I could one: Take another 5 months to fix a sub pare game or two: Start from scratch and make something better in a smaller amount of time. I obviously choose the latter.</p>\n<p><strong>:ABOUT:</strong><br/>Flesh Harvest is a psychological horror game that has an emphasis on religion. The gameplay mainly centers around exploring the messed up imagination and harsh reality of the main protagonist \"Casey R\u00eaverie.\"<br/><em>\"Casey's only way of coping with life is by activating his imagination using the power of inspiration to go to a world called Phantism.\"</em><br/><br/>Your goal is to uncover the 4 main tools to aid in your escape from the cult. Don't think it'll be easy though, the biggest road block you'll have to face are the effects of the mind destroying drug \"Bardol.\"<br/><br/>Bardol soon manifests in Casey's imagination seeking to destroy everything and paint Casey out to be the villain of his own made up world. Bardol's influence only grows stronger with the consumption of flesh, so his master plan is to gain Casey's trust and fool him into killing everyone in Phantism.<br/>\"Bardol couldn't do this himself due to his weak prowess.\"<br/><br/>The inhabitants soon learn of Casey's blind trust of Bardol and decide to dethrone him, making him into a peasant once again.<br/>Now it's up to Casey \"under the guidance of Bardol\" to take back all 3 of the main kingdoms working his way back up to king harvesting flesh and recruiting all 8 of his prior servants along the way.<br/><br/><strong>:GAMEPLAY:</strong><br/>Flesh Harvest is an adventure exploration game that has an emphasis on puzzle solving. The game has you constantly going between Casey's colorful imagination and the grim cult building to solve several mind boggling puzzles.<br/><br/>Each of the 8 servants you recruit in Phantism are fully playable with there own special field techniques that can be used on the many vast locations that you will visit.<br/><br/>The game has an exciting fast paced action time battle system were you have to time your attacks by playing a mini-game. Your team in battle allows for multiple customization choices allowing you to build a team of 4 \"Counting Casey\" using any of the obtained 8 characters.<br/><br/>Casey can be molded into whatever you want him to be due to his vast skill-set. Casey can only have 10 skills, but you can choose any 10 out of the 40 that he can obtain. To get more skills for Casey, you have to bring Bardol flesh. You can get this from killing enemies.<br/><br/><em>But wait there's more!</em><br/><br/>You can fully customize your characters stats by using Karma points. These are obtained by doing good deeds for the denizens of Phantism.<br/><br/>Casey's field technique \"Glass Of Four\" lets him change into different forms to solve puzzles.</p>\n<p><strong>:MUSIC:</strong><br/>The music of Flesh Harvest has had the utmost care put into it by the amazing Joseph Newton.
