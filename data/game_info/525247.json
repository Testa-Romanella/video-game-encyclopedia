Beat up your enemies, or blast them away. Juggle your combo, and buy upgrades in the shop. Track down your corpse after you die.<br/><br/>20+ Levels of Arcade Madness. Inspired by the Shareware and 16 bit\u00a0classics of yesteryear.<br/><br/>VECTORLORD brings some modern twists to old-school difficulty. Players only have a limited number of lives to complete the game with (run out and it\u2019s Game Over for that save file), and each successive life purchased costs more. Players have a safety net to fall back on, taking inspiration from modern classics like Dark Souls; players can restore lost lives by reclaiming them up from where they fell. As intense as that sounds, VECTORLORD offers multiple difficulty settings, plus options to tone down the neon glow for photosensitive players.</p>\n<ul><li>16 Unique Weapon Combos</li><li>Multiple Boss Battles</li><li>25 musical tracks</li><li>Non Linear World Map, where levels disappear as the INFECTOPHAGE drills deeper into your homeworld's crust.</li><li>Unlock special TOTEM, WEAPON, and CHARACTER effects, and passive SYSTEM upgrades</li><li>Dynamic Environment filled with\u00a0Sticky Fluids, Laser Traps, Speed Ramps, and Breakable Glass\u00a0</li><li>Build up your Jackpot and blast special enemies to gain massive amounts of currency</li><li>Class DOS textfile Manual</li><li>Revisit your favorite levels after unlocking them in FREEPLAY mode</li><li>3 Difficulty Levels</li><li>Support for Gamepad, Mouse and Keyboard, or Keyboard and Keyboard modes</li></ul>\n<p>For more details, read the DOS styled manual here:</p>\n<p>PC / Windows / OpenGL 4.1 Minimum (4.5 Reccomended)</p>\n<p>https://www.nervequake.com/VECTORLORD.txt<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T04:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cb63e03f3eed535d3031b4edbd6c75f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerveQuake Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
