Explore a vast open world where danger lurks around every corner, and a single misstep can make everything go wrong... But inversely, one well-placed stroke could make you a fortune...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMyranda is a refugee fleeing the horrors of war, having lost everything and everyone she's ever known and loved. Her quest is filled with interesting and sexy characters as well as dark villains who would seek to take her womanly virtues.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFar from being the stereotypical \"hero who wants to save the world\", Myranda is just another desperate civilian training to enter the warriors guild. She has no special gifts, save for a comely appearance, and in a world infested with criminals, monsters, and other sinister threats, that often bodes more ill than good. Cast out into an unforgiving new world, Myranda is forced to rely purely on her wits and wiles in order to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill Myranda be able to forge a new life for herself, relatively unscathed from the horrors that stalk her? Or will she find herself meekly succumbing to the will of the rich and mighty, becoming little more than a toy for those with evil intent?
