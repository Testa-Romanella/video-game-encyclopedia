Theme: \"You Only Get One\", 13-14 December 2013.</p><p>This is a 2d WebGL game, and my first Ludum Dare game in this format - I later did \"Mountain Rescue\" for LD29. The game ranked no. 420 and did pretty well for humour.</p><p>The game is a remake/re-imagining of Atari 2600 game \"Seaquest\" (http://youtu.be/ZeRGJk7HQGc) except with a dolphin instead of a submarine. The idea is to rescue the sailors from the sharks and put them in the boat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf1515494e9a70cee840fe3dd7533a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anton Gerdelan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
