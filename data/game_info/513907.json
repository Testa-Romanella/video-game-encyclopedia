Movie Break is a game about sorting movies based on genre using only hints from the titles! We sadly weren't able to finish the objectives due to scheduling, but feel free to run around our little rental-store playground and make a mess! We will be continuing to work on this game post-jam, and have many more features to work on such as shifting room layouts, a break room where you can buy upgrades, and more! Please be patient with the updates, though, this is our first game and we are working really hard to make something we are proud of.</p>\n\n<p>WASD to Run</p>\n<p>E to Collect Movies from the Return Bin</p>\n<p>LMB to Throw the Movies</p>\n<p>ESC to Exit to the Menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T05:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/0736e9e2e4b4a8f2c414782850032f37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ICSTrey"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
