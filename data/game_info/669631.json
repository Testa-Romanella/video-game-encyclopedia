When there are 3 or more players in a room, the match will start in 30 seconds, after which one player becomes a monster with no signs of life, which he chose in the lobby. The monster is not displayed in any way for all players, looking like a living person. However, he can use special abilities and kill residents. People can walk around the map and collect items that can detect and kill the monster. Garlic and an aspen stake act on a vampire, and a werewolf can be neutralized with a torch and a silver knife. If the monster does not kill all the people in 6 minutes, it has lost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:52:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/1595f82798f1a56ae0ee246b91a8ece9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["MrWeebeez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
