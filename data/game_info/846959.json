Anyways I hope you get at least a minute of gameplay before getting ultimately bored\u00a0and never opening the game again.</p><p>New - Ammo:</p><p>If you run out of ammo you cant shoot obviously</p><p>Every kill gets you 3 ammo</p><p>New - Background:</p><p>I added a crappy background so instead of just blue it has clouds now</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48c/48c1e09363113f2d72d32c7f385226e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ji9sw"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
