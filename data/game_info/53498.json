{"id": 53498, "slug": "clue", "name": "Clue", "name_original": "Clue", "description": "<p>Clue (known as Cluedo outside of North America) is a 1998 video game based on the board game of the same name. Its formal name is Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion or Cluedo: Murder at Blackwell Grange (depending of whether the country uses American or British English). It runs on Microsoft Windows. It was developed in 1998 for Hasbro Interactive by EAI. Infogrames (now Atari) took over publishing rights for the game in 2000 when Hasbro Interactive went out of business. The game, just like the board game, is meant for 3-6 players due to the six suspects. The game garnered generally positive reviews upon release.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd5/fd5786fca9adbffaaec2a98730b91fe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 343, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "SNES", "Genesis"], "developers": ["Sculptured Software", "Engineering Animation"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Hasbro Interactive", "Parker Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
