It is actually an assignment where we need to create a pong game and add our own mechanics in it, and as Battle Royale games were still very famous that time, I have added in some elements of Battle Royale into my game too! Now not only do players need to try their best to score a goal, they need to try their best to survive too! Hope you enjoy it, have fun!!!</p><p>(Click inside the window if the game is not responding at the very beginning)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/723/723983da990f68e023b1f0edbbab6ac6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jax1808"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
