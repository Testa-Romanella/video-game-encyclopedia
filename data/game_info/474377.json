Sometimes those secrets are hard to share. Sometimes, we keep those secrets even from ourselves.</p>\n<p>Here, no one will tell. You can face whatever is burning inside of you and be heard in safety.</p>\n<p><em>Secrets Needn't Hide</em> is a very short alt-game in which you can tell a secret (or anything weighing on your mind) to a prompt on your computer to help you get it off your chest.<br/></p>\n<p>Nothing typed in is stored - your secret is safe no matter what you put in.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for my own needs, and I've shared it in hopes that it can help anyone out there who might be struggling with something they can't talk about yet.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is <strong>completely free</strong>, and always will be, but if you do find some use for it, do think about chucking me a dollar or two. (One of my secrets is that I can't live off of ramen, haha).</p>\n<p>Stay safe, and thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>~ Arthur<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:42:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41c/41c4d10c4a8a953db411dcba61f82150.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tapestry of Stars"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
