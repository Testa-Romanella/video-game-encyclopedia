As cracks begin to appear in Beth\u2019s fairy tale plan for everything, you\u2019ll delve into her history and discover all may not be as it seems. And you\u2019ll have to choose how Adam responds to Beth as she faces her demons.</p>\n<p>Gameplay combines laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a strong interpersonal narrative, all set in a beautiful English countryside. The Magnificent Trufflepigs is a game about trying to find something, and the tone it sets is like a typical English summer: mostly pleasant, but with stormy moments that threaten to ruin everything.<br />\nFeatures:<br />\nMetal detecting!<br />\nMeditatively exploring a peaceful English farm<br />\nFinding \u201ctreasures\u201d (mostly rubbish) with your detector<br />\nDigging them up with a large shovel and a small trowel<br />\nSharing photos of your finds with Beth</p>\n<p>Relationship building!<br />\nChatting with Beth via walkie-talkie and instant message<br />\nUnravelling a mystery through interesting narrative choices<br />\nLearning about Beth\u2019s hopes and fears<br />\nDirecting the conversation to root out the truth<br />\nStarring:<br />\nArthur Darvill (Doctor Who, DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow) as Adam<br />\nLuci Fish (Safe House, Another Eden) as Beth</p>\n<p>From the lead designer of Everybody\u2019s Gone To The Rapture, AMC Games, and SundanceTV: The Magnificent Trufflepigs.<br />\nStory:<br />\nIt\u2019s summer in the idyllic northern English village of Stanning. Beth is a successful twenty-something who\u2019s poised to become the CEO of the biggest company in the valley, on the cusp of settling down, maybe having a couple kids. Life seems so straight-forward, but something\u2019s missing\u2026</p>\n<p>Many years ago, Beth found an earring while metal detecting on a local farm. It brought her brief fame (and a modest sum of cash for a pre-teen), but\u2014most importantly\u2014it made her feel special. But she never found the earring\u2019s match.</p>\n<p>Now, the old farm is only a week away from being demolished so an energy company can turn it into a solar farm. Beth decides this is her last chance to rekindle that childhood sense of adventure. There\u2019s too much ground to cover by herself, so (despite warnings from her friends) she\u2019s hatched a plan to invite Adam back into her life. Beth\u2019s search for the long-lost earring will unearth much more than she&#39;s bargained for.</p>", "metacritic": 66, "released": "2021-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-30T23:26:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c76/c76382aafb539e18eca20dcc63bbea83.jpg", "website": "https://games.amc.com/game/trufflepigs/", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 25, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["Thunkd"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AMC Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
