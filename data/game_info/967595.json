You can control your movements only while jumping, or charging a super jump. With this simplicity, it takes seconds to learn how to play, but a very long time to fully master each stage.<br/><br/>There are seven stages, each with their own unique boss battles and stage mechanics. One stage will have you use switches to open parts of the stage up, while opening new threats, Another will be about timing, hiding behind pillars. Each stage takes time to learn and master. Once you beat a stage, look at your time and try to get a better one with your newfound mastery.<br/><br/>Every stage outside of the final stage has 5 hidden coins to collect for true completion. Some can be gotten with special movements made to teach and test the player, some require going out of the way to get them. Coins are always interesting and fun to collect, and getting all 30 unlocks the final stage.<br/><br/><strong>Can you Leap to the Top?</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:02:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76e91b6b782565dc93e0dca48cbcc31e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Michael Richard Lannon"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Richard Lannon"], "esrb_rating": null}
