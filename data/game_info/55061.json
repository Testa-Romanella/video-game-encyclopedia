Like its predecessor, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, it was developed for multiple platforms, including MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amiga. It utilizes Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI0) engine, featuring 16-color EGA graphics and a mouse-based interface for movement. The story continues the exploits of Larry Laffer, who becomes stranded on a tropical island during an ill-fated vacation.</p>\n<p>Sierra On-Line intentionally toned down the titular character's sexual escapades for the sequel. According to series creator Al Lowe, this lack of Leisure Suit Larry's trademark humor is an oft-cited criticism of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-12T12:08:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/31498c212680e72ca8c2438dd8e63d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari ST", "PC"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line", "Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
