You whack the enemies for coins, keep them away from your princess, and upgrade her health and your sword in the shop. Good luck!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and left click to swing your sword. The game is fully scaled to fit endless enemy hordes that procedurally get harder, a levelling system for your attack strength (sword), and dynamically added hearts for health. There's no end to it, but if you happen to get far enough to see a creature as big as a refrigerator- you've probably played enough.</p>\n<p>The gravity system is implemented in the coin spawns, as there's not really many other places to put gravity in a top-down game, and your score per each \"session\" is added cumulatively to your Bank, which can be used in the Shop.</p>\n<p>If you have troubles with controls- play it HERE. Itch.io is notoriously buggy with embedded games, so the direct link\u00a0should give you a better experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d3/2d39811bf7aa803f685f59761c1541b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Hardesty Lewis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
