Each card has its own formula which uses your stats to determine how powerful the effect is. To raise your stats you must equip yourself with items and you will also have chances to gain stats via events. Some cards are stronger at the start of a run but fall off in effect later on, while others grow exponentially through your run. <strong>How will you build your deck?</strong><br/><br/>Procedural mapsEvery time a new run is started a random map is procedurally generated, containing random terrain types, enemy camps, random events and cities with their own exhaustible shops. Monsters will level as you progress through the map. However, as you explore, The Lost will slowly take over the map destroying cities and events in its wake. Exploration makes you stronger, but as the dead spreads it serves to empower your foe. <strong>What path will you take to destroy The Lost?</strong><br/><br/>Giving data to the playerWe want to give players the best chance of survival, so we gave them access to quite a bit of information.
