This is a pre-alpha demo release, so expect some fairly rough edges, but with v. 0.2 the game should be much more user-friendly \ud83d\ude00.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions: Move with WASD/arrow keys, hold space to assign input buttons to actions, mouse buttons for using actions. P for (un)pausing. Kill all enemies and don't die in order to win.</p>\n<p>Hints:</p>\n<p>* Some levels are (fairly) difficult.<br/>* Circle-strafing is often a good approach.<br/>* The sole kind of unit spawner can own at most ten units at a time.<br/>* Fireballs have friendly fire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f8acb21d8bd1ec9413c3fa9b7485be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["melvinwm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
