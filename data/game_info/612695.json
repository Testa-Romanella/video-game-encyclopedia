She sounds really frustrated, and...scared. The only thing that you pick up from your conversation with her is that you NEED to be back in town.</p>\n<p>After returning back, things do seem strange and <em>abnormal</em>. The town doesn't feel familiar... <em>it doesn't feel like home.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The game is an emotional, story driven platformer</strong></p>\n<p>(Controls - A,D for movement/ E to equip gun)</p>\n\n<p>I have uploaded the demo version. It contains the first few seconds/minutes of the game. It isn't too long, nor is it<strong> completely</strong> polished as it doesn't have all the sounds or scenes(gun not finished as well). However <em>the point is just to show u the overall vibe of the game and how it has been pictured by the developer.</em></p>\n<p>Hope you like it!\u270c</p>\n\n\n<p>Being a solo indie game developer, it takes time developing a game and doing every aspect of it by yourself.</p>\n<p>To continue development on this game, it would be <strong>highly encouraging </strong>for me if you consider funding the game. Y'all I would really appreciate any type of support, be it just the rating :)</p>\n<p>Plus my laptop can't really much handle unity anymore and hence I need a new one to progress further on my game\ud83d\ude41\ud83e\udd1e</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Guys again, any help would be appreciated\ud83d\ude4f</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I know I will finish the game no matter what :)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Thank You</em> \ud83d\ude4f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/14077ebabf11a0aeb8a04213d6e27627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoulTrader"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
