Now, the name of the game is to answer truest to yourself. There's no right and wrong, everyone's a winner! Ooorrr a loser, depending how you think about it. Life is all about perception, you see. Onto the first question! </p><p>You're a murderer, we all know it. But do you think you are? </p><p>Close Your Eyes is an early 2014 horror game I made for Ludum Dare 29 in two days. While there were elements of the game I liked, there were a lot of problems with it, so I've decided to spend a few more days on it, remove elements and sections I didn't like, cut down on the long 'walking' segments, and add a lot of new content to make it really a whole new game. </p><p>Through a stroke of sheer luck, you've managed to escape death row. Taking to an underground subway, you try to find your salvation. Can he break free of the past that binds you, and please, can you close your eyes? Just close them. </p><p>Everything in the game is made by myself and the artist I work with, Rincs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/0939829879ebb5e4f610b3b8451009aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AestheticGamer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
