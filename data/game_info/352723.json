The three squares represent the drums, bass and melody for the song. When they pass over a coloured tile a note is played.</p>\n<p>The top left has a sequence, it shows the order that the moving squares must pass over notes to start the lyrics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left click to change grey tiles to coloured\u00a0notes, click repeatedly to change the note. Right click to remove a note. Complete the sequence to start the lyrics, complete one verse of the lyrics to move to the next level.</p>\n<p>The lyrics t the songs are generate using a markov chain loaded with Shakepeare's sonnets and can continue forever in the unlikely event that you are enjoying the song.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-27T09:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88eb309b61e4daabcd6db40d7c42b0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigNZ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
