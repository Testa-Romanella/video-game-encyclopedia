Military and powerful, each day it annihilates the nearby kingdoms, destroying their cultures and taking over them. One by one, the kingdoms fell until the ones who weren't dominated decided to group themselves and fight back under the banner of the Libertasians Alliance. Angered by the group's attitude, the great Emperor Eligius Emeritus IV now seeks to find the 6 magic crystals created by the Goddess Vitalia to control the terrible serpent Obitus and force the entire world to bow down to him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T03:07:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59c/59c342c6c1dc283277c47a046feb8114.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Witz Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Witz Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
