The hermit crab has only hard shells on the upper body but remained soft on the other parts of the body, so it needs to find empty shells of other animals to live in. The way of finding an empty shell wouldn\u2019t be easy, cause a hermit crab could mistakenly get into a piece of trash left on the beach, which will eventually cause the death of the hermit crab.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Plastic debris in the ocean can entangle sea creatures unknowingly. it can act as both a barrier and a trap to countless populations. Each year 570,000 hermit crabs die after climbing into plastic debris, confusing it for empty shells.\r\n </p>\n<p>We hope that player could sense the difficulties of surviving for a hermit crab, and realize what consequences will our unconscious behavior of littering bring to the other members of the nature.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>As a player, you may be able to play again, but the hermit crabs can never resurrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Things player can do:\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.Find/put on shells<br/>2.Find food<br/>3.Explore the shallows</p>\n<p><strong>Things trigger the death end:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1.Can\u2019t find a new shell on time<br/>2.Put on the wrong shell (indirectly)<br/>3.Doesn\u2019t eat for a long time<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Interactions between player\u2019s decisions:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>* Put on a trash will slow the player down<br/>* Eat too much food will shorten the life of the shell</p>\n<p><strong>Instruction demo:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Modeling:</strong> <strong>Yibo Fu, Crystal Tan</strong><br/><br/><strong>Game Code</strong>(including character moving and reacting in the game): <strong>Yuqing Liang</strong><br/><br/><strong>UI</strong>(including interface visual design and health bar/wear-life bar coding): <strong>An Kong </strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:37:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efcb08619068c3083c361e0e26b62560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["liangyq404"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
