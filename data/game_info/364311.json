The aim<br/>is to increase skills in game development and getting some more samples for the showcase.<br/>Just like the previous experimental games this game is more of a design<br/>study than a program you could charge real money for. Therefore it\u00b4s<br/>available for free to anyone who finds pleasure in it.</p>\n<p>This game\u00b4s idea originated a monthly contest of the site \"experimental<br/>gameplay project\", which can be found here:<br/>http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/2010/09/neverending-in-september/<br/>The goal of that contest was to build a \"neverending\" game. So I thought<br/>of things that do not end. Unfortunately \"war\" seems to be something that falls into that category. While most of us know, that real war is<br/>a terrible thing, we all (well, at least males) see a \"space war\" as a source of neverending excitement. Add some \"zapzapzap\"-Sounds and<br/>laserlike graphics and there you are. :-)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 As always it\u00b4s left to say that especially I want to thank the artists whose music titles and sound samples I was allowed to use under diverse Creative Commons licenses.
