Equipping everyone and setting their resource generation mode is important. The enemy will always act in the same order and target the same characters in its action cycle (unless it hits a certain Hp threshold or some other condition is met). There are no variable amounts of damage, hit rates, critical chance, or whatever. If you do the same thing, you will get the exact same result.</p>\n<p>However, while the enemy's actions are predictable and certain, there is only so much time you have to beat them. If they complete 9,999 actions before you defeat the last opponent, they will destroy the world on the 10,000th. While this appears to be an RPG, it's closer to a numbers puzzle. Try again and again, and do your best!<br/></p>\n<p>Party members can be switched through an individual character's Switch command, or by hitting Esc and switching out any party member with the Formation command. This uses an ATB system where 5 party members are active at once, but you have 99 total characters available.
