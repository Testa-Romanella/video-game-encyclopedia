{"id": 308830, "slug": "luminescent-judah-lambert", "name": "Luminescent (Judah Lambert)", "name_original": "Luminescent (Judah Lambert)", "description": "<p>Luminescent is a 2D side scrolling Metroidvania focused on exploration. The game takes place in a world protected by a powerful underwater leviathan that acts as a guardian for the human race and governs the sea. In praise of the guardian the humans built an underwater temple and often presented gifts. One day they gifted a large crown to the creature and soon discovered that the crown carried a curse. This curse brought corruption upon the kingdom of the sea and started a war between the land and ocean. So a diver from the human kingdom is sent underwater to infiltrate the temple and set the leviathan and ocean free of corruption. You, the diver have to adventure through the underwater temple and the <strong>only</strong> source of vision in the game\u00a0 is your jar of luminescent light.\u00a0That light will slowly decrease and you must find other resources for light to regain vision while underwater.\u00a0This game is being developed by two high school seniors, Colton Lambert and Judah Avery. We would love to turn this game into something more professional and fleshed out. Any support or feedback is extremely appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:52:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1ee248fcbfa6bb7a6361040ce08da424.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Judah Lambert"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
