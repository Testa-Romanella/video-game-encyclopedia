Failure states don't have the cleares indications, usually just a sound, so it can be confusing.<br/></p>\n<p>If you press something in the building menu and nothing happens, you did not have sufficient resources to purchase that thing, did unfortunately not have the time to add an indicator here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T15:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/1911f776a8e2d9df0402bcf1a915506d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kreativ"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
