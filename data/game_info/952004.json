To progress in the game, you will have to research, evaluate the reliability or credibility of information and publish it in the vast digital world, which will certainly be useful in your student and professional life!<h3>Exploring a new world</h3>Your application to the university department has been accepted; your interstellar science internship takes place on Sollertia, a newly discovered planet. This is a world where plants and minerals do not react as they do on Earth. The environments, or biomes, are mesmerizingly beautiful, but don't let that distract you, or at least not for too long, from your research goals. The department has granted you the help of the droid Copernick in order to help you in the realization of the missions.<h3>Multiple missions to realize</h3>The missions in the biomes are varied since the environment as well as the properties of the plants and rocks are constantly changing. The scientific missions included in your internship have two main objectives. The first objective is to find scientific information that could help regenerate the Earth's ecosystems. The second objective is to improve your knowledge and skills related to digital literacy.<h3>Why a serious game?</h3>Play to learn! Far from being a distraction, this educational game is an active form of learning that aims to motivate you. Odyss\u00e9e num\u00e9rique offers an environment in which your actions receive feedback to guide you in completing missions. No real danger! Mistakes are opportunities to learn. Don't forget that repetition allows for greater retention.<h3>What you can expect</h3><ul><li> A soothing ambiance and music while exploring the environments<br/></li><li> Discovering natural species with form and properties you've never seen before<br/></li><li> Computer-generated environments containing multiple puzzles to solve<br/></li><li> Learning critical thinking and other digital skills while doing the intranet research<br/></li><li> A charming game about spatial exploration and saving the planet Earth</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T03:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a01/a0181af468d75e0b58e28563cc7aad2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucid Tales"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec"], "esrb_rating": null}
