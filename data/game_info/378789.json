I\u00a0didn't understand why my body seemed to work all the\u00a0time against me, and also it seemed so difficult for other people to understand what was happening to me. I\u00a0really believe that games are a powerful media and I\u00a0hope that PTSD can connect with many people out there and make them feel less alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hugs and thanks for playing with my baby.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>*Note:\u00a0after the 3rd scene there is a bug for exiting the game.
