{"id": 59117, "slug": "loot-monkey-bling-palace", "name": "Loot Monkey: Bling Palace", "name_original": "Loot Monkey: Bling Palace", "description": "<p>\n      Loot Monkey: Bling Palace is 2D, flip-screen platformer that tests your \n      wits and your patience, not your ability to mash buttons. Inspired by \n      Jet Set Willy and Manic Miner, Loot Monkey: Bling Palace is more of a \n      'thinking person's platformer' where you'll need to consider your route \n      through the many strange rooms of the loot-littered Bling Palace.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      You play as Dougie, the Loot Monkey, who has been instructed to collect \n      his master's loot at The Bling Palace following a party. Featuring \n      vibrant graphics Dougie must explore every room in the palace collecting \n      all the twinkling loot just lying about. Dougie must also avoid the \n      weird enemies and sharp hazards and lumps of vomit that the party has \n      left behind, or else...\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Loot Monkey: Bling Palace is the sequel to Loot Monkey and builds on the \n      sweet essence of 1980s video games with colourful modern graphics, \n      designed to look great at 1080p. There is also original cheesy synth \n      music and constant taunts from his master, the Evil Overlord (he just \n      wants all the blingy loot).\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      An extra feature is a choice of game mode for a variety of challenges \n      and gameplay options. There is a practice mode for those who wish to \n      jump straight into any room in the Bling Palace (requires room name, all \n      are fixed and can be swopped freely, no unlocks/keys required). And \n      there are harder modes for those who think extra lives are for wimps. \n      The hardest mode is only for the brave: Dougie has one life and no extra \n      lives can be added to it.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Be a clever, brave monkey and gather the master's loot but don't step in \n      the vomit.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-15T10:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e44/e44abc9e5e6c9936a8dbca88b3d29d06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tackorama"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Tackorama"], "esrb_rating": null}
