Unlike most of those, players are never eliminated and forced to sit out until the rest of the game is finished.<br/><br/>Eight players are randomly divided into two teams; Church or State. Depending on your affiliation your job is to either protect your king from being discovered and converted to church, or aid the church in their search.
