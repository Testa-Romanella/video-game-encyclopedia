You're too small to take them on in combat, so you'll have to rely on the power of speech and persuasion to get them to leave!</p>\n<p><em>(The game was originally a standalone .exe so players may have issues messing with the resolution/exit settings.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36ba62bdfa0487ac29ee5fe45f01f8f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SpritersBlock"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
