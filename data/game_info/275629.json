Use the voices you hear to return to crime scenes, tracking down each individual involved and solving the cases. But where do the voices come from? Can you trust what you hear? And what\u2019s the mysterious thread weaving all of these cases together?</p>\n<p>A Unique Case-Solving Experience<br />\nDiscover the truth hidden in the voices from the past.<br />\nStep through time as you use our device to eavesdrop on conversations from past crime scenes. Every clue, every move, and every motive will be presented in the form of audio. Rather than controlling any one character, you only need listen to their conversations, following along as the story evolves. Use the information you hear to match names to voices and determine how everything (and everyone) is related. Can you discover the truth?</p>\n<p>Open-Ended Narrative Mystery Game<br />\nExplore the story and piece together the puzzle in your own way!<br />\nDon\u2019t expect to be \u201cfed\u201d a pile of clues. Rather, take the role of a fly on the wall, observing and listening to the events as they unfold. Anyone could be the culprit; key clues may be revealed at any second; any character&#39;s storyline may cross paths with another at any point in time. YOU be the editor\u2014the order of the story is up to you!</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Tributes To:<br />\nDetective Fiction: In Unheard, all the clues in a case will be presented to players. There&#39;s no hidden information, nor rooms that require a key to enter. Players will be privy to the same information as everyone present at the crime scenes.</p>\n<p>Immersive Theater: All characters in Unheard have their own storylines; however, each of these storylines will become interwoven in the same space, and at the same time, resulting in complicated cases that force you to meticulously search for and track clues. You can choose to follow one character or move around between multiple characters. You can also replay the audio as many times as you want until you reach a conclusion.<br />\nRadio Drama: Unheard is, in a way, an interactive radio drama. By combining aural narrative techniques with the type of exploration elements present in video games, Unheard offers a brand-new, non-linear radio drama experience.</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:<br />\nSpecial thanks to our voice actors and directors in both China and the U.S. Thank you for your continued hard work and support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-15T17:44:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/332/33276d598e6e505b374b1a662a67f91c.jpg", "website": "http://www.thenextstudio.net/unheard/", "rating": 4.07, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 358, "beaten": 42, "toplay": 14, "dropped": 11, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 60, "suggestions_count": 227, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 60, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["NEXT Studios", "BILIBILI HK"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["NEXT Studios", "BILIBILI HK"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
