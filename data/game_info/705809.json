The astronaut must try to survive for as long as possible as toxic gas-filled meteorites dart across the planets surface.<br/><br/>Isolator is a fast-paced top-down bullet hell game where the players goal is to survive as long as they can in order to get a high score. As time progresses more and more meteorites will appear that the player must avoid. If you get hit three times, it's game over. Your only hope is to manipulate the walls located in the central area of the playing field, to isolate yourself from the meteors. Once isolated you can activate one of two beacons to destroy any isolated meteors on a cooldown.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T13:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd638f4f10b7a734bf241f5a6b25a274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hayden Carter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
