Any registered member can create their own maps and publish it for 40 in-game cheese pieces (it used to be 20). It is also required for the players to have 1000 pieces gathered on their account. During a game, each third map is community-made. After the time expires, a voting window appears, where the players can share their opinion on the map. If the map&#39;s rating gets lower than 50%, it gets removed from the game. </p>\n<p>Map categories were later added to the game. </p>\n<h3>Emotes</h3>\n<p>The players can use nine animated emotes: dance, laugh, cry, kiss, anger, applause, sleep, facepalm, and sit.
