{"id": 579577, "slug": "little-martian-2", "name": "Little Martian", "name_original": "Little Martian", "description": "Little Martian is a game of exploration, resource-gathering, base-building, and survival. You have crash-landed on an uninhabited planet and your spaceship is very badly damaged. You'll need to find the resources to repair and rebuild all of the destroyed parts, many of which require some very specialist materials. Your first priority, however, is surviving the first night.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce that's out of the way you should consider building a rudimentary base, somewhere to live whilst you're stranded on this planet. A base will protect you from the elements and provide a source of oxygen, since the levels of sulfur in the atmosphere are too high for it to be breathable.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you continue to build parts to repair your spaceship you start to notice something odd about the planet. It appears to be dying, and your untimely arrival may have accelerated its demise! Obtaining the resources you need might just destroy it! Oh, and it looks like you might not be alone after all!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T02:57:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c8/0c886103980e903c8cbcca4f33361e10.jpg", "website": "https://little-martian.dev", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Little Martian Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Little Martian Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
