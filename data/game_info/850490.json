{"id": 850490, "slug": "mistwinter-bay", "name": "Mistwinter Bay", "name_original": "Mistwinter Bay", "description": "<p>You are the sovereign of a town called Mistwinter Bay. The sovereign you create decides the fate of the town and everyone in it. Decide which buildings to build \u2013 and who gets to live in town. Interact with your townsfolk by sending them on missions or hang out one-on-one. Each character is unique, with their own profession, personal history and strengths and weaknesses. Deal with international politics by befriending or becoming enemies with powerful foreign leaders. Watch the seasons pass as you are faced with a unique, random event every month. The way you decide to handle an event not only affects the ending of the event itself, but the entire town. Will you become a sovereign loved by all or will you adapt your choices to please someone in town \u2013 or perhaps someone across the sea?</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Create the sovereign you want to be with the powerful character creator. Choose between a variety of faces, hairstyles, outfits and accessories, with several color choices for all. All options are available for all types of sovereigns, no matter if you play as male, female or anything in between.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>The town of Mistwinter Bay is home to all sorts of people. Living in the town from the start are the Avallerist priestess Dawn, the innkeeper Cecil and the graveyardkeeper Erewen. These townsfolk are at your service, ready to be sent to handle tasks in events if you ask them to. You can hang out with the locals one-on-one if your reputation is good enough. Eventually, this may even lead to marriage. Keep in mind, however, that they are their own individuals, with their own opinions, and they may like or dislike you based on your actions. If you are unlucky \u2013 or cruel \u2013 you actions may even spell their death.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>At your assistance are your two advisers \u2013 Jacques and Sophia \u2013 who keep you updated on any and all things going on in Mistwinter Bay and beyond. Trust your advisers or go against them during random, unique events that occur every month. The choices you make in these events may affect individual townsfolk, the entire town, and maybe even places beyond it.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>Mistwinter Bay can be expanded at your leisure \u2013 given that you have the resources required. You decide which buildings to build and ultimately who lives in the town. Most buildings are associated with a character, so when a new building is built, you can expect a new face in town. If you are ever curious about who can move in to town, make sure to check out the local inn every season to see who has journeyed to Mistwinter Bay.\r\n </p>\n\n<p>Mistwinter Bay is but a small town on a great continent full of colorful cultures and people. As a new player on the continental arena, you get the chance to meet and interact with some of the most powerful people on the continent of Hruminus. If you play your cards right, you may gain powerful allies \u2013 maybe even a spouse. However, if you manage to get on a foreign leader\u2019s bad side, you may find yourself in more trouble than you bargained for.\r\n </p>\n<p>The version you can download on this page is a demo of a larger game, which is currently in development.
