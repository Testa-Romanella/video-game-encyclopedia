The goal is to remove candies by forming lines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least five candies of the same colour. If the player does form such lines of at least five candies of the same colour, the candies in those lines disappear, and he gains one turn, i.e. he can move another candy. <br/>If not, three new candies are added, and the game continues until the board is full.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/720c3ff529fd5cc243ad6565e70df785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["vmoga"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Viet Game Development"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
