The evil Harry the Harrier wants to use his alien Brain Blobs to zombify dinosaurs and bring them into our present timeline to take over the world. Looks like all hope is lost, and humanity is doomed...<br/><br/>...NOT!!! <br/><br/>Harry didn\u2019t count on Dexter the Dinodroid slipping away with a time machine. Now this totally radical dino dude with a \u2018tude has gone old school \u2014 like, 200 million years ago old school. Travel around with Dexter in his time machine and get the 4-1-1 on those dinosaurs to find them before the Brain Blobs show up to turn them into zombies!<br/><br/>This FMV educational adventure from Philips Interactive Media, Inc. is a sweet slice of 90s nostalgia. Search grid-based maps for clues to help you find each dinosaur using all kinds of dino facts you find along the way. Use the Grunt-O-Meter to send Dexter out to a location, and he\u2019ll report back what he sees to you. Gather enough hints from Dexter about each dinosaur\u2019s morphology, behavior, and habitat, and you\u2019ll know exactly where to find each one. Harry the Harrier thinks he\u2019s all that and a bag of chips, but he\u2019ll have to take a chill pill when he sees how good you and Dexter are at tracking down dinosaurs before they can be zombified!
