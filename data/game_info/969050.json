He envisioned a golf game where he himself was the ball, yeeting himself to glory across boundless and whimsical landscapes. Believing no obstacle was too great, he kissed his mom goodbye and bounded off to be the inaugural member of his own golf league.<br/><br/>Squish, jump, roll, and spin your way to golfing glory by getting Brian to the flag on each hole. Improve your score through the use of strategic powerups and collect hats along the way that can totally change the game experience and give Brian some flare. Remember: \"Don't SEE the ball. BE the ball.\"<br/><br/><h3>Use powerups to shave strokes off your score! Choose from 9 different powerup types.</h3><br/><ul><li>Mulligan - Make a bad shot? Use a mulligan go right back to where you were and reset your score as well.<br/></li><li>Sticky Shot - Stick to whatever you touch first after shooting.<br/></li><li>Aim Assist - Get a visual representation of where Brian will fly as you line up your shot.<br/></li><li>Rocket - Use a limited amount of rocket power to push yourself upward.<br/></li><li>Ghost - Use the ghost powerup to go through walls!
