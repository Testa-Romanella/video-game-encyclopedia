Populated by and Featuring other people's characters!</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0In a rough state, still in prototype stages\u00a0- we plan on developing throughout July. Missing some basic things like Saving and Menus, but will be implementing very soon! Currently one crop and seed implemented - more items and crops on the way!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>SPACE to Jump</li><li>Left Mouse Click to Plant Seeds and Water Crops on dirt</li><li>\"E\" to interacted when prompted</li><li>\"I\" to open Inventory</li><li>Drag and drop inventory items onto Hotbar</li><li>Press 1-9 to switch Hotbar Items</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tutorial:</strong></p>\n<p>The name of the game is growing Crops and Selling them in your shop! Start by heading to the backyard to plant some of your Bloorrot Seeds in your garden, and Water by switching to your watercan and Left Clicking. Once fully grown, you can harvest and place your crop onto the pedestals in your shop. Wait for customers to do their thing, and then assist them at check out with a special Haggling system!!</p>\n<p>Try selling your items at a higher price than the Base price. Customers can be surprisingly varied though - experiment with the amount and see what you can get with each individual customer!</p>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>\n<p>This year once again overlapped my two favorite events - <strong>Art Fight</strong> and <strong>My First Game Jam</strong>! This time around I got to collab with my lovely partner Grin, who took care of Programming and basically making the magic for the game. As per Art Fight's rules, all the actual attacks are completely my own work (The models and textures themselves).</p>\n<p>Even though My First Game Jam will be ending, we will be continuing to update the game until the end of this year's Art Fight. I hope you look forward to it!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>, Models (including all Character Models), Textures -\u00a0<strong>PizzaOwl</strong></p>\n<p>Design, some Models, Programming - <strong>Grinjr</strong></p>\n<p>Characters owned by: Takaia (Takaia),\u00a0Toadcrafts\u00a0(Ollie), Sagjig (Maverick)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T14:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d454cb0c9fd681d1033f46c8a13c728c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pizzaowl"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
