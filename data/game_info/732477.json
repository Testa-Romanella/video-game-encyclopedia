But one day a great hero showed up, defeated Akuji and his vicious power was sealed into nine stones. The hero married the princess, became king and they lived happy ever after...</p>\n<p>...until now! You take the role of Akuji and have to find the nine stones that were hidden somewhere in the Lost Underground to get your power back and have your revenge on the brave knight...</p>\n<p>&quot;Akuji the Demon&quot; is a cute and colourful platformer. It&#39;s not as hard as many other platformers and it has a clear level design that isn&#39;t too confusing. Because of that and the fact that there is nearly no brutality, the game is even suitable for younger kids (which doesn&#39;t meant it&#39;s not good fun for adults as well).</p>\n<p>The download includes the original Japanese game file as well as an English translation patch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-03T23:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ffde48cff214162177a764486e20a87.jpg", "website": "https://archive.org/details/Akuji_the_Demon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["E.
