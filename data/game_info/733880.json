Push the mirrors by walking into them. You can even push multiple mirrors in a row!<br/>Place the mirrors so that they reflect light circularly, creating an infinity mirror effect. In other words, if a mirror receives a beam of light, it must also reflect that light into another mirror.</p>\n<p>If you get really stuck, don't forget you can play the levels in any order! <br/>Good luck!</p>\n<p>Made with my fork of Puzzlescript (more details &amp; credits here).</p><p><em>v2: Reduced player movement speed.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-26T17:01:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3e/c3eb4d289f376fd58f4829f75c2560a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Auroriax"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
