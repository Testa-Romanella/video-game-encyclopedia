The week before the jam I took some time to prepare the technical side, as I was developing the game from scratch without an engine using SDL2 and an ECS library. After my preparation I had the ECS library included, was able to read keyboard inputs and render tiles. On monday I started the jam with a tile that could be moved on screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:17:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b18/b189dd116a656d16a0adab3297df1b4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikolas M\u00e4hlmann"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
