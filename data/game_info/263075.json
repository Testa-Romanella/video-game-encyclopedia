And so the longer he stays up there, the more he feels like a clockwork orange. With more and more time passing, the orange gets torn up inside. Eventually there is no more juice left, no oranges, but only the windup mechanism. Concerning the image used for the puzzle, the recurring face comes from Inio Asano's Punpun, where that face is an anthropomorphic representation of the protagonist's dark thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Just a regular tile based puzzle and a nod to some of\u00a0Inio Asano\u2019s works.
