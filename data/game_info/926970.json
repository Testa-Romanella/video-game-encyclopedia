This six-game epic collection features a variety of diverse and absolutely canonical endings. Every step of the journey requires you to make a choice, such as using a teleporter or calling your friend Charles for help. Correct choices will advance the plot, but wrong choices will lead to failure. If you manage to complete it on the first try then you are doing it wrong as failure is also part of the fun of the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:07:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22b/22b1a023eceec6d0ea7d15df06f1ab3f_kkmamo6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["\u690d\u6210 \u9ec4"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["\u690d\u6210 \u9ec4"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
