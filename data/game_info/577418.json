I took screenshots of bricks in Studio, and used them as textures for details, and Unity Tree Creator.</p>\n<p>All behaviour uses elements of the microgame, the only script I added is the drowning detection, and I tweaked the game manager script because I did not want the player to lose when they explode... I really wanted this to be as relaxing and non-frustrating as possible.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T09:07:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12a/12a213afac1c2ea7670a956460d3e79e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["iani_ancilla"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
