The very last one was this past week.  We had one week to design a game based on a randomized theme.  The theme this last time around was \"Alchemy\".\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tTo play this game you have to think about colors.  Use your gun to remove barriers that block your path.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMove is standard WSAD.  Right mouse button to fire.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis level shows the potential for the game to have color based puzzle elements.  Further development of this game would include things like color based enemies as well, with AI that would guard and be vulnerable through color coordinated areas.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tA short presentation on this prototype can be found on my \r\n\tYouTube channel.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be6ec922ba4976e042f6c3612320808e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Casey Shreve"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
