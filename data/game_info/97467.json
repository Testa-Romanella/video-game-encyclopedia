The game won a silver medal in the competition, and has been known on the c64 gaming scene as a high score chaser and party game for friends to compete to get the best high score.<br/><br/>After the success, a full version was put in production. The full version had more lumberjacks to choose from, more background graphics, more music and a two player death match mode. Unfortunately the game development stopped and the project was cancelled. The preview version is 90% finished, as only the polishing and some small extra features are missing.<br/><br/>If you want to know more about this project, you can reat about it\u00a0here.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Programming by Eric Hilaire<br/>Graphics and music by Roy Widding</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22cebbdc3acc7b7c6cce93d89ff4cd5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Megastyle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
