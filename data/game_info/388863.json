{"id": 388863, "slug": "redemption-road", "name": "Redemption Road", "name_original": "Redemption Road", "description": "<p>Redemption Road is a game that attempts to simulate the problems and challenges of an addict that is at an important crossroads in their life. Either they square up and try to endure the hardest part of recovering from addiction and turn their life around for the better, or relapse and stay an addict indefinitely. Each day brings its own challenges, and the game uses the metaphor of Spoon Theory as a vehicle to explain to non-addicts what it\u2019s like when every single choice that happens in your life, those in your control and out of it, costs emotional energy from a very limited supply. The purpose is to hopefully educate non-addicts about the daily struggle of drug addicts, and to hopefully bring awareness to their struggle and pity to their plight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:28:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435876ea1251c92d4f4589581f1a3bcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AcidOX"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
