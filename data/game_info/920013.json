Sniffing will help point you in the right direction. Root around in the dirt once you find the spot.\u00a0 When it's time to root around, pushing down will dig out the block below you, and pushing against blocks to your left and right will break them eventually. Bring back any truffles you find to the farmer, and once they're all found the workday is over.
