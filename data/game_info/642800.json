Be careful because if the ball bounced out of the maze and couldn't get into it again,\u00a0then you will lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This minigame currently contains just 2 levels and you should pass them under 30 seconds.</p>\n\r\nCrystal Cavern:\r\n<p>In this minigame\u00a0you are a ball in a cave !!!</p>\n<p>You have to collect all Crystals to pass the level, and there is no timer in this minigame.</p>\n<p>You can restart the level only in this minigame by pressing the R key.</p>\n<p>This minigame currently contains just 2 levels.</p>\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n<p><em>THIS IS A BETA VERSION SO YOU MIGHT FIND BUGS AND THIS BUILD DOESN'T REPRESENT THE FINAL QUALITY...</em></p>\n<p>Please feel free to report any bug or mention upgrades\u00a0for upcoming releases.</p>\n\r\nGame Contents:\r\n<p>some of the game contents aren't created by me but for some reasons I don't remember the owner of some assets that I have used in this project, because I have started working on this project from 2020 then pause developing this project as I was busy studying my school subjects.\u00a0For example, like the main menu soundtrack. But the things that I remember, first concept for this game was taken from a\u00a0Udemy Course the game icon and logo text was made by\u00a0Text Studio.</p>\n<p>the next release of the game will be called the REBIULD version. In this release\u00a0I will create a logo for the game by myself and get another main menu soundtrack as if you play the game you will see that it's not compatible with the contents of the game.</p>\n<p>game updates are currently paused because the next year is the final year of my school stage so I should be studying hard, wish me luck ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/242/242521498d67e6c1c72b13a55ac60fbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DEVEslamisHere"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
