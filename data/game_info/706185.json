{"id": 706185, "slug": "broken-earth-beast", "name": "Broken Earth Beast", "name_original": "Broken Earth Beast", "description": "<p>This is my first attempt at making a series of free, short RPGs that I am calling \"Side Quests.\" <br/></p>\n\n<p>The game takes place on a battlefield, a contained warzone. You will be fighting through enemy soldiers to hunt down one specific enemy. It's a short game, only about 20 minutes. This will be part of a series of games that I'm making, all small little independent side quests. This is the first one. The combat system is a typical turn based RPG. I did not use side view for this one. <br/></p>\n<p>Take control of the character, Special Ops soldier, \"Iron Demon,\" whom has been hastily summoned for a mission that few soldiers could handle. Defeat enemy soldiers to receive \"Killer Points\" that you can use to buy skill capsules to choose how you want to build Iron Demon. Choose between sets of armor to play with skills of your liking and with stats of your liking. Defeating enemies can cause \"instructionals\" to drop, which allows Iron Demon to learn new skills. There are also stronger enemies that drop accessories which will give your character more skill choices. <br/></p>\n<p>However, you can not have all skills at once so for some skills there is a choice to be made. There are several stronger enemies to defeat above the normal battlefield soldiers.</p>\n<p> Above all, your main task is to get strong enough to defeat the Broken Earth Beast, a man whom has transformed on the battlefield to become a true beast of war. Before you will be able to defeat the Broken Earth Beast you will likely first encounter the other 4 stronger enemies. That is, Dark Scientist: Spider, the poison user. Dark Science Master, the magic expert. Melt General, a powerful enemy with unique weakening skills and the Sand General, an even more powerful enemy that isn't afraid to stoop to cheap tricks to get the advantage over you. <br/></p>\n<p>For combat you have three main skill types. Instinct skills, Focus skills and Channeling skills. Instinct skills are low cost and come from lots of training. Focus skills are advanced techniques that easily wear the user out. Lastly, Channeling skills tap into outside powers to strengthen the user in some way yet come at a high focus cost. <br/></p>\n<p>Learn to mix your skills together well for optimal fighting ability. Even if you don't, the enemies will.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T14:50:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4db1af58770f5315199c8a93dd82c59e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpicyNoodleStudios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
