There are no brakes and your train is stuck on accelerate, so it just gets faster and faster. <br/>You can collect missiles and use them to collect diamonds faster. <br/>There isn't any time limit or score. All you have to do is collect ALL of the diamonds . <br/>The first few levels are not so hard, but as you progress to the upper levels, you will find it more and more challenging to play with SuperSpeed3D! <br/>Easy to learn, difficult to master!<br/>9 levels, with a link to the full version, which features 45 levels!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d700b5a95519331a0eaaa0c9e76a89_mjQzGYh.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kathrin Brock"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Kathrin Brock"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
