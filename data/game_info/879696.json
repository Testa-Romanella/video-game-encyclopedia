You will compete against a trained AI agent, controlled by the CPU. Whoever stores more fruit in the cage wins. But remember to avoid touching the crabs, or you will lose points!</p>\n<p>The game has no sound. It is the result of\u00a0my simple\u00a0introduction to ML Agents, so don't expect it to be perfect. The AI agent is not 100% accurate, but sometimes he sort of\u00a0knows what he's doing. This was the best result I could get of around 12 different machine learning training sessions.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T05:09:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fb/2fb29768fd7578c3cd2df24fb0010060.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gabriel Pereira"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
