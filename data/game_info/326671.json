Also turn-based puzzlers like Full Bore, DROD,\u00a0and Stephen's Sausage Roll.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROL is simple USE LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS or A/D. Finding out exactly what you and you rake can do is more complex!\u00a0This game has REWIND ability USE SPACE BAR.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently there are 9 levels and no ending. I have more challenges and an\u00a0ending planned so check back!</p>\n<p>Thank you, I hope you escape The Mortacrust!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:14:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa6c7f6b40ee408ef1baa20ad69f302d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["z_bill"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
