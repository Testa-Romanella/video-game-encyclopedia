Doesn't sound easy, right?<br/><br/><br/><br/>When you are required to think fast, a lot of game aspects can change. Some strange and dangerous moves might be just the ones needed to solve something in this game.<br/>Wild Goo Chase provides you with 30 unique levels and several cube types formed into countless combinations of puzzles and traps. Your goal is to have each cube at the right color goal by the end of each level. While trying to achieve so, your cubes will be attacked by walls that are trying to push them off the edge and destroy your chance to complete the cube combination. This is precisely why you have to think fast and move your cubes in a very calculated way.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>In some situations every move is important, that is why you have to move one move at a time but combine those moves as fast as you can.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Solve it fast, solve it good and think outside the cube!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff52d128c5b2a20c6c898b1da865803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cubecumber Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo", "Cubecumber Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
