In addition, you help us do something to save the forests. We will donate the entire additional profit from the sales of the soundtrack to\u00a0support the\u00a0Eden Reforestation Project.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the beginning, this project was inspired by our conviction that playing Imagine Earth would be an exciting and motivating way to experience the most urgent and unavoidable challenge of mankind - climate change. The game crystalizes a planetary ecosystem and economy into mechanics that allow you to make your own decisions on how to solve the upcoming challenges. With this in mind we were able to survive seven years of Early Access, always knowing that we were working on something that would unfortunately only increase in relevance and urgency over time.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow with the game being ready we want to add something more tangible on top, by supporting global reforestation and forest protection with the soundtrack profits of this bundle. If you want, you can take this oppurtunity to get the game and the soundtrack and to support the planting of new forests at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal of the organization<br/>\n<br/>\nForest destruction is a global phenomenon caused by a variety of factors. These factors range from large-scale slash-and-burn agriculture to unsustainable agriculture to daily forest destruction in communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe regions most affected by deforestation are very poor and underdeveloped areas. With few options to feed their families, members of impoverished communities are often forced to destroy their local environment in order to survive, such as cutting down trees for construction, fuel, heating, and agricultural purposes. While this solves a short-term problem, long-term consequences occur when forests are cut down and not restored. The effects of deforestation are dramatic, leading to severe flooding, erosion, and desertification. The long-term effects of deforestation lead to even worse environmental degradation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe solution to the problem<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two key elements to successful reforestation. The first element is that reforestation must be a benefit to the local community. Because of the unsustainable relationship between land and people, the communities that suffer from deforestation are often the same communities that live in extreme poverty. It is important to engage and work with local villages and communities to achieve successful and sustainable reforestation. Eden Reforestation Projects uses its \"Employ to Plant\" methodology to support members of the local communities where we plant. Through steady employment, people living in extreme poverty can afford everyday necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, and medicine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second critical element is funding. Without donors, business partners and grants, there is little hope for successful and effective reforestation.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T05:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff23fd8fe5765bb853438bda6f18fd18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 474, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Serious Brothers"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Serious Brothers"], "esrb_rating": null}
