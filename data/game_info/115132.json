The miner was going to give up until he \r\nheard there was some Unobtainium available on a dangerous alien planet.\r\n The miner has gone to this planet to risk everything he has got to get \r\nthe Unobtainium and get back home safely.</p><p>Help the miner find the Unobtainium by using his jetpack and gun. \r\nAliens on this planet are not happy with any extraterrestrial beings and\r\n will try to kill them.
