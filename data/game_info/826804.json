He scrunches his face up while he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, loser?\u201d as he tries to hold back a yawn. \u201cWhy are you calling me at 3 a.m.? Shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping by now? Like the angel you are.\u201d<br />\nIt takes a couple of blinks for him to register your face. But once he does, a wry smile creeps onto his face. &quot;Don\u2019t tell me you miss me,\u201d he says, raising his brow.<br />\nA jolt of butterflies rushes throughout your body when he says that, and you\u2019re embarrassed to admit it. But it\u2019s late. And you\u2019re tired. And your brain short circuits\u2026which is why you have a dumb and flustered look on your face. It takes him a second to register what\u2019s happening.<br />\nOnce he understands, he starts blushing and cups his face with both hands. Between his fingers, a whimpered sound comes through, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you actu\u2014.\u201d<br />\nYou were not going to let him finish that sentence. You gathered all your bravado together and muster the willpower to piece together, &quot;Wow, if I knew my silence was all it took for you to crumble, I would\u2019ve become a mime.\u201d<br />\nHe buries his face in his hands for a moment longer. But once he uncovers them, his familiar cocky smile is back, \u201cAww, but if you did that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hear all of your snarky comments&quot;. He rests his head on his hand, cocking his face to the side, flirting with you.<br />\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a flirt. Do you really think anyone would fall for that?\u201d. You know he&#39;s just looking into the webcam, but for a moment it feels like he&#39;s looking directly into your eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else would fall for that, just you.\u201dFeatures1 Hot snarky asshole man (stupid f-ing smirk man_)<br />\npronoun opSIONS!! &lt;3 &lt;#<br />\n3 endings (1 bad end, 1 good end, 1 proposal)<br />\nhella soundtracks and songs<br />\nsome amount of play time? like 1-3 hours depending on how ur vibing<br />\nability to hack into the dev&#39;s PC and change ur m00ds<br />\nfrisghteining ability to make hacking look like a hangman puzzle<br />\n5 million dollars<br />\nPLEASE PLAY WITH THE MUSIC BOX THERE ARE LIKE HELLA SONGS OOP<br />\nnuggets,,,WarningswaMRING DEEX NUTS ON UR FACE!
