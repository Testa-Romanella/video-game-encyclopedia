And the endless quest. For The Perfect Bounce.</p>\n\n\n<p>An idea that was inspired by a Game Jam that I ended up being unable to participate in, however I've been working on this on and off for the past month or two, it's a simple game about bouncing a ball forever. I wanted to make a puzzle game with very simple rules and graphics. This release is the first 5 levels, expect more updates on this in the coming month or two!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/352/352ce985741d37c1eb6fa78eefcaf7f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broddiccus"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
