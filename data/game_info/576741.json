Honestly I just wanted to make something to play with friends so I kept it simple to streamline the process and focus as much as I could on the mechanic side of things.<br/><br/>Features to be added:</p>\n<p>Adventure mode:<br/>Main mode of the game with a world map and several different locations with missions and quests.</p>\n<p>Endless mode (hopefully next update):<br/>A game mode that would auto generate dungeon levels based on pre built pieces, something I didn't get to finish but I'm still working on, should be done soon.<br/><br/>Multiplayer mode:<br/>A game mode to connect with up to four players to play the adventure mode at increased difficulty according to the number of players.</p>\n<p>Shops and towns:<br/>Areas with no combat and implemented stores to buy upgrades for exploring and combat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:10:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c4a26f7365cc358219e8d92bdcf2cb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["QuizmasterHanzo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
