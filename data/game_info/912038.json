It must be said that this is far from a proof of concept of the vision, hence only in the early stages of physics experimentation.</p>\n<p>The game would ideally have a progression system that enables players to upgrade to the right tools for the right \"fishing assignment\", depending on whether the player is deep-sea fishing, lake or stream fishing - catching lots of fish or just that one BIG fish.</p>\n<p>Aspects like strength and energy should play in, to e.g. ensuring an energy usage when using different kinds of rods/tools as well as fishing for different kinds of fish.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to support the supply of \"food\" within its meta game \"Worlds FRVR\", however, can also be played as a hyper casual game at any moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T09:59:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/378/3785c19fe69e8fe6e13cf45fe74c5cd8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yasinjensen", "Roger13"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
