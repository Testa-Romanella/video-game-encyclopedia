But with a bit of a twist, you require energy to jump, and there are red mindless baddies itching to take away that energy, so good luck getting through these trials. luckily we (I) added recharge stations for morale support. So what are you waiting for?! There's loads of energy that has yet to be drained.</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to DigiPen for providing the engine and a lot of the experience necessary for me to be able craft this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/934/9340a2caef4f4b09122c9b862d90df96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["justintime4u2bu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
