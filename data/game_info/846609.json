Looking around your ship, you find some old tools, enough fuel to land on the nearest planet, and a strange textbook on... Geology? Maybe this'll help you somehow...</p>\n\n<p>Excavate various rocks across the galaxy and bring them back to your lab for testing. In your lab, you have to perform various tests to see what kinds of rocks you found - and how they could be used. Problem is, you don't know too much about rocks just yet. So that somewhat-sketchy textbook you've found will be of some help... probably. At least it's a good starting point, even if whoever wrote this thing must be criminally insane. The facts about rocks are true, sure, but wow this thing is cluttered! Maybe you should write your own \"textbook\" if you want to maintain your sanity...</p>\n<p>Some of these rocks aren't just rocks, though. Aliens often camouflage their eggs to look like common rocks - so be careful. Your test results won't lie, though, so if something doesn't add up, dump it in the incinerator. Not worth taking any chances.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Programmer - Chris (https://puglic.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Artist - Bella\u00a0 (https://yaboibells.itch.io/)</p>\n<p>Audio - Jackson (https://jacksondevico.itch.io/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T09:08:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74f/74fc5675592922ada54a4bb60dd52b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["puglic"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
