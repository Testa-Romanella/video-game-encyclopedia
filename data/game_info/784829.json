Will she continue to 'live' or embrace a new world of uncertainty?</p>\r\nControl:\r\n<p>You can trigger game options and dialogue by clicking with the mouse.</p>\r\nDeveloper note:\r\n<p>This is the first game I have made. This game is available to play online(<strong>Full-screen mode is highly recommended</strong>) or to download for the best experience!</p>\n<p>I used Adobe Illustrator to create the characters and scenes, and the dialogue and interaction in the game were done by Fungus and Unity.\u00a0\u00a0The background music is Hon Hopkins' Monsters Theme.
