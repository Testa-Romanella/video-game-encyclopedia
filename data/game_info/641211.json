{"id": 641211, "slug": "bell-bottoms-and-brainwaves", "name": "Bell Bottoms and Brainwaves", "name_original": "Bell Bottoms and Brainwaves", "description": "The year is 1962.\u00a0\r\n<p>The United States military has been conducting secret experiments on \u201cwilling\u201d subjects in a program called PSY-CLOPS (Psychic Covert Learning Operatives). The program has successfully created a 6th sense in a\u00a0\u00a0<strong>REDACTED</strong>\u00a0number of subjects. This 6th sense can manifest within a subject in several ways, but all of these abilities are simply referred to as \u2018powers\u2019. The project has been funded for the past\u00a0<strong>REDACTED</strong> years, but in last month, there was a problem. The Pentagon wants answers.\u00a0<strong>REDACTED</strong> subjects have managed to escape.\r\n</p>\r\nYou are one of those subjects.\u00a0\r\n<p>The game takes place in the \u2018normal\u2019 world of \u201862. Big cars, color TV, drive-ins, malted milk shakes, and beehive hairdos. You and your fellow escapees need to blend into society and avoid the feds, police and sending society into a panic. All of the patients had a regular schedule of pills, known to as \u2018candy\u2019, and without candy, your psychic abilities are becoming more powerful... and more difficult to manage. Your other senses are more sensitive from unlocking a 6th sense\u2014you\u2019re more irritable, and when your senses are overloaded, your powers can become erratic.</p>\n<p>You start with nothing except a shaved head, white top, white bottoms and white slip-on shoes. No money. No job. No home. You\u2019ve been barely getting by since you\u2019ve escaped. Thank goodness you have powers. You need to stick together with your fellow escapees if you have any.</p>\r\nPatient Brief:\r\n<p>As a patient (player), you are\u00a0trying to survive after escaping scientific experimentation that left you with supernatural powers that you struggle to contain. The Game Master (GM) will continue to give you scenarios in which your goal is to be normal. Fail, and you will be pursued by <strong>THE MAN</strong>. Note: <strong>You do not want to go back</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\nGame Master Brief:\r\n<p>As the Game Master (GM), you are laying out a setting and scenarios for the patients. You will prompt the patients with the golden question of, <strong>\u201cwhat do you do?\u201d</strong> The GM <strong>never</strong> rolls dice against the patients, but instead has the patients test their luck when they do something tricky or challenging, instead.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b85ee3254aed5f78bcd580d502cb12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mekkakat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
