WHAT THEY'RE MADE OF?</h3><br/><strong>1. Wrap the dimensions</strong><br/><br/>You live in many spatial dimensions. Use this to your advantage.<br/><br/><strong>2. Impossible connections</strong><br/><br/>Because connections are just the product of your mind.<br/><br/><strong>2. Portals. They break gravity</strong><br/><br/>They can also break your brain. Just kidding, the game is fun, not hard.<br/><br/><strong>3. 4. 5. 6... n</strong><br/>Multi-dimensional boxes, guns, bombs, Amelia, doors, keys, more perspective, etc.<br/><br/><strong><h3>ON GAME</h3></strong><br/>I remember the Light is a story driven puzzle game, that explores the idea of living in different spatial dimensions, that wrap on each other.<br/>It came from my fascination of imagining what it's like to live inside the tesseract. <br/>The game is still in mid-early development stage. As a solo dev I have a lot of things on my hands. But I manage :)<br/><br/><strong><h3>CONSIDER WISHLIST</h3></strong><br/>I create puzzle games to make you happy, please consider wishlisting the game and joining it's steam community.
