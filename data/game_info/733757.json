Early Saturday morning the theme of \"<strong>Limitation</strong>\" was revealed to base the game submissions on. After spending Saturday brainstorming ideas with my twitch live chat, I decided\u00a0to go for a puzzle game with limited direction. Created with Unity3D &amp; C# scripting. Artwork in GIMP. Music &amp; Sound made on the BeepBox website. Visual Studio Code was used as my code editor of choice. Lastly, some of the post processing effects, such as bloom, I used Unity's URP (Universal Render Pipeline) package.\u00a0Some of the development process I was able to livestream live on my vtuber twitch channel, other development I was able to get done in-between college homework sessions.</p>\n<p>devgod2020 - Twitch<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In this game, you get to control bob, a pixelated alien that really love coins. Only there is one problem, he is\u00a0<strong>limited </strong>to travel in only two directions. To learn a new direction in his short-term memory, he must collect arrow cards to remember how to travel certain directions. Bob has two pockets, so only can hold two arrow cards to remind himself. In order to clear the levels, Bob must collect all the coins in a level, then reach the yummy cheese ball to fill his tummy, giving him the power to teleport to the next level.</p>\n<p>All levels are randomly generated, so I challenge all to see how far you can get. Each level adds an additional iteration in my algorithm, so higher levels = more coins to collect and higher difficulty. The game goes on for infinity.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys to move Bob</p>\n<p>Q key to pick up items</p>\n<p>R key to Restart Level</p>\n<p>ESC key to close game</p><p>Mouse Scroll Wheel to zoom in and out</p>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Bob the Alien is currently available for windows. Simply Download the folder from the downloads page.\u00a0Unzip / extract the folder. Lastly, double click the .exe file and the game should launch.</p>\r\nShout Outs\r\n<p>I would like to thank my Twitch viewers &amp; friends SoultakerSpirit, Psych00 &amp; SavageJacek20 for helping contribute towards idea brainstorming\u00a0for my game. While I was the only one that \"worked\" on it, I got a lot of amazing game advice &amp; encouragement\u00a0from these people to participate in a\u00a0Game Jam for the very first time.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks you for showing interest in my game.</p>\n<p>:) DevGod2020</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:53:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876e7ab1d6b358c1ab58a0e75adc8d01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevGod2020"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
