However, in this game, the square you choose dictates how the other player must play.</p>\n<p>How to play:\u00a0\u00a0The first player chooses one of the 81 squares to mark an X and the next player must choose based on\u00a0that choice.\u00a0 For instance, let's suppose he\u00a0chooses the square at the\u00a0second line of the third row of the central grid. That means the second player must put his O in a square of the grid at second line of the third row.\u00a0In the event that grid is already occupied, he can then pick any free square.</p>\n<p>When a player wins a tic-tac-toe in one of the 9 grids, he occupies that grid. The goal is to occupy a line, a row or a diagonal of grids.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T04:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f4124a11465c370902410313ab9ef242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nacibneme"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
