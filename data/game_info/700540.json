{"id": 700540, "slug": "out-on-a-limb-carterjgreene", "name": "Out On a Limb (carterjgreene)", "name_original": "Out On a Limb (carterjgreene)", "description": "No arms, no legs, no problem!\r\nSummary\r\n<p><em>Out on a Limb</em> is an early puzzle-platforming game concept developed in GameMaker Studio 2 by Carter Greene. In it, you take control of a mad scientist\u2019s test subject who has been dropped into a haphazardly\u00a0constructed gauntlet of devious challenges. The catch is that the good doctor has so graciously decided to saw\u00a0both your arms and legs clean off! In their place you must choose from a variety of replacement limbs, each with their own unique functions -- and setbacks -- that will impact how you move through the level. Can you make it through the scientist\u2019s sadistic trials in (mostly) one piece?!</p>\n\r\nWhat's Finished?\r\n<p>Thus far, the game has an introductory hub area as well as a gauntlet of FIVE big levels full of dangerous platforming challenges for you to complete. This wing of the mad scientist's lab, \"The Workshop\", supposedly houses the doctor's latest and greatest invention: the\u00a0<strong>ROCKET ARM</strong>! Find it and use it to boost across gaps, reach high-up ledges, and avoid those\u00a0<em>nasty</em> sawblades.<br/></p>\n<p>In addition, there is a SECRET demo level hidden in the game where you can test out some of the other limbs that will be implemented in the future!</p>\n\r\nWhat's Next?\r\n<p>While the little red guy you play as is a total heartthrob, I would like to eventually put in a character that more reflects the sorry state the scientist has left him in. I imagine having your arms and legs sawed off wouldn't leave you feeling as chipper as our current protagonist makes it seem. In addition, I want to have at least three more gauntlets of levels that utilize the other limbs that I've developed. If any more limb ideas come to fruition, maybe there will be even more levels to create! A guy can dream, anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:40:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e6/1e6dab664c874f6eb50b7a4c0606ff82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["carterjgreene"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
