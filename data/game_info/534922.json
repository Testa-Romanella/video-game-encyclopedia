However I think I made some mistakes which can cause frame lag while the music stays constant which makes these seems off beat in the second song. I didn't have time to fix this, so have included the source if you want to poke around and fix things yourself. Let me know if you ever use or expand upon it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you can enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Free Art from OpenGameArt.org and Kenny.nl \u00a0</p>\n<p>Free Music from Peritune\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:31:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/984/9842287241bb9ae2bc6edc67b96929e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fanttum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
