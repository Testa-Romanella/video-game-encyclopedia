I got inspiration from various friends and family members of mine.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Komi is a teenager who is getting fed up with their own emotions. While they have an unsupportive mother that only calls or communicates with them when something at home has to be done. On the Other hand their father is not even present and it feels there is something more to this side of the story. While Komi sleeps they enter a dreamworld full of things that look out of this world. It seems totally contrary to the real world Komi lives in . Furthermore Komi can escape the voices in their head that tell them what to do. The Dreamworld on the other hand seems to have its own mysteries. Komi explores the Dreamworld and tries to find out what the secrets of this mysterious world are before they have to wake up again\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Please stay updated for further versions!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T13:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df0/df03a10ffede5b6aeff20d3a48f64db0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WeirdColors"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
