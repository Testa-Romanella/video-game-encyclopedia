Each of its 9 holes offers players a new challenge, from moving platforms to portals. No padding to be found in this game.</p>\n<p>There are 9 coins to collect (1 per hole), and if you get them all, good job! There's no other reward. The satisfaction should be enough, really.</p>\n<p>You best score is shown on the main menu as a reminder of how much\u00a0better at the game you used to be.</p>\n<p>Also, Unity's collider systems don't work 100% of the time (every time), so on the occasion that your ball gets stuck, you can press the\u00a0<strong>R</strong> key to reset the level. Of course, you could (ab)use this to get a godly overall score, but that's up to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/876/876c8403a0e58fed5b88101108c02e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sart Games"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
