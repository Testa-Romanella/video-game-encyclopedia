Just stuff a sheep or ram with a heap of poisonous filth and feed it to a dragon. Of course it's not the most heroic method but it is very safe and effective. Another option is to announce a reward for the dragon\u2019s head. After that the only thing you have to do is wait while the army of heroes, wizards and freaks drive a monster to its grave. It is always necessary to find a solution to the dragon problem because all the members of this scale-winged tribe have the same disease. It is a strong allergy to humans and their settlements and all dragons use the only medicine against this illness; total annihilation of the humans. <br/><br/>Troubles with dragons are in the forefront of \u201cMajesty: Northern Kingdom\u201d. Of course you\u2019ll have to defend your kingdom from the other evil spawns, for example how about the giant stone golems that have an outstanding amount of hit points? Expanding the territory of your kingdom and starting the northern expansion in the land of the frost and winter you\u2019ll have to rack you brains over the riddle of fire-spitting monsters.<br/>\u201cMajesty: Northern Kingdom\u201d- it\u2019s time to feed the dragons!<br/><br/>Game features: <br/><br/>- New missions and new location \u2013 Northern Lands <br/>- Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for mobile platforms <br/>- 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armor <br/>- New monsters<br/>- Several dozen spells <br/>- 30 upgradeable building types<br/>- Changeable weather <br/>- Skirmish mode <br/>______________________________________ <br/><br/>Keep track of HeroCraft game news and updates!<br/>twitter.com/Herocraft <br/>youtube.com/herocraft <br/>facebook.com/herocraft.games<br/>______________________________________ <br/><br/>\"Majesty: Northern Kingdom\" and \"Majesty: The Northern Expansion\" are trademarks of Paradox Interactive. <br/>Developed and published under license by Herocraft.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T03:12:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/920a65196507b8f8b2e7e44f33f65628.jpg", "website": "http://www.herocraft.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["HeroCraft"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["HeroCraft"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
