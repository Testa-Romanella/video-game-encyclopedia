Finally let the Leprechaun guide you over the rainbow and to your pot of gold.</p>\n<p>Best played with 1152x720 or larger since that's what we tested.</p>\n<p>We made this game on Train Jam and it was the first - but not the last! - game we've ever made.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Spacebar to stay afloat</p>\n<p>Right and left arrows for navigation</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Lucy Monahan (LuJam, @SoFetching)\u00a0- Unity</p>\n<p>Deirdre Carney (CurlyWurly, @RealCurlyWurly)\u00a0- Art and Design</p>\n<p>Elie Abraham - Music</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Crabman,\u00a0Ashraf, Joseph and Melanie</p>\n<p>Thanks so much to Everyone on Train Jam who supported and encouraged us the whole way!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/3588e7b3af7b0c29162d75b1dc9f07ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LuJam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
