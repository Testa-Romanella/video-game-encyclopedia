Objects, plants, animals and even humans. You should reach the sacredness limit to complete the ritual. However, it is hard to keep every sacrifice happy. And sad sacrifices mean less sacredness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sacrifice Management is a mouse-only puzzle game. Just move sacrifices to the altar. Oppositely, you can remove sacrifices from the altar by moving them outside. Each sacrifice has a sacredness point (SP). You own a sacrifice\u2019s SP when you place it on the altar. On the other hand, sacrifices may have a love and a hate list. If a sacrifice is placed adjacent to another one on its love list, its SP increases (not permanently, only for that positioning - base SP never changes). Similarly, hate decreases SP. You pass the level when you reach the level\u2019s sacredness limit.</p>\n<p>Since levels are generated by an algorithm, you may experience very easy or absurd levels. The first 4-5 levels were intentionally designed as easy. After level 13, it becomes more challenging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/771/771ac7d55e401afb8836652487979f39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aycan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
