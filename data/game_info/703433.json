Finally embrace your powers to become Thick or Thin. Use your creativity to solve challenging yet fair puzzles. In each world, you have a different power to affect the size of objects, and it is size altering strangeness.\r\n </p>\n<p>The size manipulating behaviors include: the ability to enlarge or shrink yourself and other items, objects that are immune to being altered, areas that nullify your powers, density control, elasticity, molecular fractal discharge, and perhaps more.\r\n </p>\n<p>Through Thick &amp; Thin treats your time and attention as precious. There's no filler in this game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.\r\n</p>\r\nCore Features\r\n<p><strong>The Thick System</strong> - manipulate the size of yourself and other objects, from tiny to absolutely gigantic!\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Rich Puzzle Environment</strong> - Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces, then solving puzzles by manipulating time: rewinding, creating parallel universes, setting up pockets of dilated time. The gameplay feels fresh and new; the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Forgiving Yet Challenging Gameplay</strong> - the challenge is about solving puzzles, rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps.</p>\n<p>Can you be comfortable in your own skin or let anxiety stop you from personal growth?\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>\"FullTimeGameDev.com - Super Simple 2D Game Kit\" for additional code, sound effects &amp; assets.\r\n </p>\n<p>\"Freesound.org\" &amp; \"Zapsplat.com\" for royalty free music.\r\n </p>\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>Cherie &amp; Norah for love &amp; support.\r\n </p>\n<p>Thomas B. for mentoring.\r\n </p>\n<p>MOA Group for accountability.\r\n </p>\n<p>You for playing\u00a0\ud83e\udd47.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T09:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37c1d00e19623bf41907017b1f403e47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saeed Gatson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
