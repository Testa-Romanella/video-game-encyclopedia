The downloadable version of the game includes additional post process effects and graphics enhancements.</p>\n<p>This project was made for the weekly game jam 32 and is a prototype I\u00a0may explore further if enough feedback is given. I have already gotten some good tips to improve.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Sound has been added to the game along with some additional tweaks suggested to me in the weekly jam discord. I\u00a0will probably add a more experimental\u00a0set of second levels soon as well.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:\u00a0There is currently a bug in the web build with lighting. I'm building a new version now which will be updated shortly.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e83/e83be62f31786231a32720c94d2b6b5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["TylerC"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
