Not in this case. Games are turn based and progress is always saved. You can face many enemies at once in multiple online games like a brave soldier would. <br/><br/>Two types of planes are waiting on the runway. Choose between small angry planes or big powerful ones. <br/><br/><br/><br/>What else is there: <br/><br/>- an artificial intelligence for single player missions that strikes with no mercy, never cheats and never takes prisoners (we call him \"Frank\". General Frank). <br/><br/>Frank masters two difficulty levels, try to beat him on Hard mode if you dare. <br/><br/>- leaderboards to compare your skills with other great pilots. <br/><br/>- medals and achievements for war heroes. Are you good enough to become \u201cSkymaster\u201d? <br/><br/>- spread the news of legendary victories on Facebook and Twitter. <br/><br/>- to mark your place in history, the scores against every enemy are recorded and remembered. <br/><br/>- use the latest communication technologies to command your squadron on iPhone or iPad. <br/><br/>- lost a fight? The war is long. Review ended battles and rethink strategies. <br/><br/><br/>Pretty cool, huh? <br/><br/><br/>So pilot, start your engine, climb the winds, <br/><br/>touch the sky and remember the wise words of The Greatest: <br/><br/>\"The man who has no imagination has no wings\" - Muhammad Ali", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d31898b7c31814b6c6aa38a8eaa235ea_jXBK6IZ.jpg", "website": "http://www.victorcampeanu.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Victor Campeanu"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Victor Campeanu"], "esrb_rating": null}
