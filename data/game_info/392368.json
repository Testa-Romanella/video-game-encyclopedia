On the verge of death, his parents gave him a paranormal substance known as the Sorrowvirus, which contaminates the human soul; preventing it from passing onto the afterlife when they die. This causes them to fall to Purgatory instead, where they can heal and eventually return to life. However, every time Wyatt comes back to life, his illnesses and diseases return quicker than before. Wyatt's parents allow him to continue dying over and over while they perform research on organic particles found in Purgatory that may cure him once and for all. <br/><br/>Wyatt, having died so many times, simply wants to let go; both his mind and soul are shattered.
