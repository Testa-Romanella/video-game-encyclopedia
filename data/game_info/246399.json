Rent-A-Friend Radio has gained fans on the internet, and now we take you behind the scenes to explore the Studio where the show broadcasts from! In this episode, I (Rent-A-Friend 2000) talk about the Proof for God's existence and\u00a0reasons to avoid Shia Labeouf, and Bryan from A Bit of Orange warns us about\u00a0the slippery slope of Wind Chill. There's a few items to click and maybe toss around, a poem and at least one way to die. So, be careful out there! We hope to put out a new version of this adventure every month, so send questions, suggestions, and artwork for the office bulletin board to us at</p>\n<p>AskRentAFriend@gmail.com</p>\n<p>And thanks for letting me be your Rent A Friend!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Editor's Notes:\u00a0When you click on an audio trigger, it will play the whole thing until its done, so if you click on another, you'll have to listen to both until they are both done. And that's kind of annoying, so, I suggest not doing that.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f2b3ac380c1730020878249ad2ad33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rent A Friend 2000"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
