The assignment was to develop an N-In-Row game (where the player wins by getting tokens in a row such as Tic-Tac-Toe).</p>\n<p>It is a\u00a02D two-player abstract N-In-A-Row game. The game is inspired by popular mobile game 'Chain\u00a0Reaction'.</p>\n<p>Player 1 assumes blue tokens whilst Player 2 assumes red tokens. Player's take turns placing their tokens on a 4x4 grid board. First player to get 4 of their tokens in a row wins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Split has a unique mechanic where a player can convert the opposing player's tokens by placing their tokens next to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n<br/>\r\nLeft click empty-grid block to place your respective\u00a0token.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:39:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2f379161c32e1688767c62009733033.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dhevan Lau"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
