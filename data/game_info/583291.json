If you are helping us test, there is a link to a testing feedback form below. Thank you so much on behalf of the team for helping us improve our creation.</p>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from the mid 80s classic Commodore 64 game Arkanoid, our team have remade this historical 2D game with some twists. Designed to play on an arcade game in VR, for now we are just testing the 2D PC Alpha version, in preparation for the Beta release on completion of the game jam.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys move the starship (paddle), once the right power-ups have been collected, space will fire the laser cannons.</p>\n<p>Testing feedback form:</p>\n<p>Trello Board:</p>\n<p>Backstory:</p>\n<p>Team Members:\u00a0 Team Lead &amp; level design Jeremy Pernesz ||\u00a0Art(3): ImAwesome04, Julia, Laith || Programmers(3): Kamatis (Discord), Brandon, Jeremy Pernesz || Audio(2): Chris, Kevin.</p>\n\n<p>As this game has been created for a Game Jam, we are under tight time constraints. There are some things we would have liked to fix for the Alpha however we need to release the game now so we have enough time to gather play testing feedback.\r\n</p>\n<p>Things we will fix for the next release:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Menu and exit game (currently need to exit by closing the application)\r\n</li><li>Sometimes balls go too horizontal\r\n</li><li>On life lost the blocks reset\r\n</li><li>More music and levels will be added\r\n</li><li>A score multiplier will be added once you finish all levels and loop back to the first level. Currently the game ball increases in speed</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T22:23:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c08/c087e9f2f15496423b115a9c4b98e32d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kr4yZ33"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
