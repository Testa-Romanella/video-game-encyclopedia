The interpretation we went for was three-fold:</p><ul><li>An action game where the player does not have a proper weapon, so our little bear knight only has a shield.</li><li>A metroidvania-like game without power-ups, health drops, etc. All of the skills you need to finish the game at the start are available to you, and your health/shield regenerates over time.</li><li>A non-violent platformer-like game, which is why in the game you can only stun enemies (and move past them) but when you re-enter the room they'll be back and ready to fight.</li></ul>\n<p>There are a couple different routes to the prize so please consider replaying it at least once more. There are 21 different rooms to explore.</p>\r\nOther Notes\r\n<p>We recommend downloading and playing the Window version since it has a couple last minute patches which we were unable to upload in time.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Move:\u00a0Left/Right\u00a0arrow\u00a0keys</li><li>Jump: Space</li><li>Block: Shift</li><li>Throw Shield: Control</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>ART:\u00a0https://twitter.com/LlamaCheez\u00a0&amp; https://twitter.com/paigemarincak</li><li>PROGRAMMING: https://twitter.com/paigemarincak</li><li>PALETTE: https://lospec.com/palette-list/endesga-32</li><li>MUSIC: 8-bit Dungeon Boss https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=29&amp;page=2</li></ul>\r\nTools\r\n<ul><li>Game Engine: Game Maker Studio 2</li><li>Art: Pyxel Edit, Aesprite</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bd/2bde47b65546f4bba56e747fd47150e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Atemly Games", "HoleyCheese"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
