Uhhh your a detective and your investigating a crime scene by clicking on stuff to learn more about it (even the ground). After this you'll have to interrogate someone! It's pretty much the same thing except they answer and you get new information. Once you think you have enough click the begin button. You will have to answer a character's questions by clicking on evidence. Clicking on the wrong evidence will take away one health or one magnifying glass. Loosing all three will result in you losing. The music and art is all by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T11:34:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b33/b333c9be676c7f69a362ec5a681ddfe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LemonChip545560"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
