The goal is to find out correct angle and power to hit the enemy tank. Gameplay is turn based and each player has one attempt per turn. When some player hits the enemy he gains score and game continues in next round with different terrain.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u2190</strong><strong> \u2192 </strong>change angle of cannon</li><li><strong>SPACE</strong> start loading (1st hit) and shoot (2nd hit)</li><li><strong>Ctrl</strong><strong>+C </strong>exit game</li><li><strong>Ctrl</strong><strong>+R </strong>restart current round</li><li><strong>Ctrl</strong><strong>+</strong><strong>N</strong> start next round</li><li><strong>S</strong> show score</li><li><strong>A</strong> show player's attributes</li><li><strong>H</strong> show help</li></ul>\n<p>When running from browser use just <strong>R</strong> / <strong>N</strong> instead of <strong>Ctrl+</strong><strong>R</strong> /<strong> Ctrl+</strong><strong>N</strong><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T03:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e9/3e95117d9cb2ba1347147c3e7cd42a3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["zladovan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
