SDL2 in this app are usable as a standalone library for most any modern Ada graphics project.<br/>* Currenly, the game has one fairly easy campaign in Sparta, and a more difficult one in Crete.\u00a0 There is no reset capability...you must replay from the beginning if you die.\u00a0 You select the desired campaign at the beginning of the game.<br/>* To change the appearance of the avatar, simply download your favorite MineCraft Skin, rename it to \"skin.png\" and put it into the ./data/ directory.\u00a0 You should probably backup the current skin before you do this, in case of trouble.\u00a0 See http://www.minecraftskins.net/.\u00a0 See also ./data/avatars/ for a small selection.</p>\n<p>## mouse/touchpad/keyboard controls</p>\n<p>[You might need to disconnect unused gamecontrollers to prevent spinning!]</p>\n<p>Look direction is controlled by touch pad or mouse;</p>\n<p>Movement is controlled by the WASD keys or the arrow keys:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Up)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Lt)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Dn)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0(Rt)<br/>---------------------------</p>\n<p>*\u00a0\u00a0 (esc)-key \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0=&gt;
