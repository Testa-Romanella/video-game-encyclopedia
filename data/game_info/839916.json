I was lost in thought after reading the story for the first time: humans\u2019 craving for the unknown is so strong, but those who are seeking may not even know what the ultimate truth is. The eventual result could be too harsh to be accepted, but you cannot just reject it when it comes in the way. Destruction? Co-existence? Every individual takes it differently. I was fascinated by the description of this concept in the story. From there, I wonder how I will tell a similar story in the form of a game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T10:50:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d1d2d0ef027f497eabd041dd5fa429f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WMeng"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
