{"id": 90230, "slug": "eggs-for-bart", "name": "Eggs for Bart", "name_original": "Eggs for Bart", "description": "<p><strong>GameJolt Mirror: https://gamejolt.com/games/eggsforbart/355488<br/></strong></p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<p>Eggs for Bart is a Simpsons Parody horror game, in chapter 1 you play as Homer and you need to get eggs for Bart. You must get 2 dozens of eggs and leave the house to give to Bart, but you can only carry a half dozen at a time so you'll have to make 4 trips inside the house and out, also the night will get progressively harder as the night goes on.. with cutscenes after each level that connect into a story of loss and a mystery left unsolved. It won't be easy, as you're not the only one who needs eggs, such as Marge. Only eggs can sustain her and she will go after you and try to take you and your eggs. However she's not the only one who needs e g g . . .</p>\n\n<p>After the events of chapter 1, the Simpsons have gone missing without a trace. However, a certain worried neighbor takes matters into his own hands and goes looking for them himself. \u00a0It seems as though he's been gone for a while though.. Should we file another missing person's report..?</p>\n\n<p>Eggs for Bart is free to play and always will be - as it is a <strong>parody.</strong> Which falls under fair use. If you ever pay for this game somewhere else you should request your money back immediately. There are only 2 places on the internet with official downloads to the game by me, Fleebs, which are this itch.io page and the GameJolt page of the same name. If it is found anywhere else that does not link back to either of the 2 pages contact me immediately.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mouse (Cursor)</strong> | Look<br/><strong>WASD //\u00a0 \ud83e\udc39 \ud83e\udc38 \ud83e\udc3b \ud83e\udc3a</strong>\u00a0\u00a0 | Move<br/><strong>Mouse (Left Click)</strong> | Flashlight On/Off<br/><strong>Left Shift </strong>| Sneak<br/><strong>Left Ctrl</strong> | Crouch<br/><strong>E </strong>| Search<br/></p>\n<br/><br/>\n<p><strong>Game:</strong><br/>Directing, coding, graphic design, etc. by Fleebs</p>\n<p><strong>Font:</strong>\n<br/>Simpsonfont by Sharkshock on Dafont.com</p>\n<p><strong>Models:</strong>\n<br/>Models ripped from The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run + The Simpsons: Road Rage found on Models-Resource.com\r\n<br/>\r\nFlashlight model by Steve45 on Free3D.com<br/>Springfield model by Soap161<br/>Simpson's House model by Craftydelight<br/>Knife model by PancakeMan96 on Turbosquid.com<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Graphics:</strong>\n<br/>Rain Texture by mrwasd on YouTube.com\r\n<br/>Post Processing Stack by Unity Technologies on the Unity Asset Store\r\n<br/>Third Person Controller by Unity</p>\n<p><strong>Sounds:</strong>\n<br/>Footstep sound effects by Unity Technologies<br/>Rain sound effects by TheMSsoundeffects on YouTube\r\n<br/>Door Open sound effect found on Epidemicsound.com\r\n<br/>Marge voice clips by GameGrumps on YouTube.com</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong>\n<br/>Engine - Unity 5 Personal\r\n<br/>Modelling/Rigging - Blender\r\n<br/>Graphic Design - Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\r\n<br/>\r\nSound Editing - Adobe Audition CC 2018\r\n<br/>Programming - Microsoft Visual Studio 2017</p>\n<p><strong>Misc:</strong>\n<br/>The Simpsons and it's characters are created by Matt Groening for FOX<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/fleebs<br/>Twitter: https://twitter.com/fleebs_tw<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bargingo._/<br/>Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/fl33bs<br/>GameJolt: https://gamejolt.com/@Fleebs<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>I\u00a0did\u00a0a\u00a0Q&amp;A\u00a0answering\u00a0your\u00a0questions\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0story,\u00a0development,\u00a0and\u00a0future of EFB!
