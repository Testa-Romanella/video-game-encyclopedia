I'm Federico Moroz from Buenos Aires, Argentina.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Arcade Saloon Fighter '94 is my first step in this gamedev world.\u00a0It was made as a assignment project for Escuela Da Vinci using Construct 3.</p>\n<p>It's a classic 2d beat'em up game, just like the ones I played as a kid in the 90's:\u00a0Final Fight, Captain Commando, Cadillacs &amp; Dinosaurs, Street of Rage, TMNT, Simpsons, X-Men, and the list goes on.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The characters are Hazel, Almon and Pine (yes, they're nuts).\u00a0My favorite game ever is Chrono Trigger (SNES,\u00a01995). Its characters were designed by Akira Toriyama (Dragon\u00a0Ball,\u00a0Dragon Quest) and I wanted my guys to look a bit like them.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to comment below if you liked it or any suggestion.<br/></p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:10:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06c/06ca76ef4fab519ab01014254688a611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FedeMoroz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
