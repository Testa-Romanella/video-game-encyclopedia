With a team of 6 people including 1 GD and 4 3D, we created a VR escape game in 3 weeks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our game was made on Unity 3D. All the 3D models, animations and environment were made by the 3D team. The programming done in 3 weeks is not complete, some puzzles are missing and bugs are present, but the game is still finishable.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Script pitch :</strong></p>\n<p>Jean, a psychologist, is trapped by an avalanche in a train carriage. The rescue team will be in your area in less than 30 minutes, after which they will have to stop the search, as the storm is too strong. You will have to escape from the carriage and join <strong>them before they leave.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game pitch :</strong></p>\n<p>With no one around you, escape from your snow-covered wagon! Using only your hands, you must solve puzzles using keys, padlocks and codes. To get out, you'll have to search every room in the wagon until the last one.</p>\n<p>Game designer :\u00a0</p>\n<p>- MARTIN Chlo\u00e9\u00a0</p>\n<p>3D team :\u00a0</p>\n<p>- SECOND Loona\u00a0</p>\n<p>- SOLER L\u00e9o\u00a0</p>\n<p>- DAERDEN Florent</p>\n<p>- DALLE Julien</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T04:55:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd2802e0d1fb0f82564e102211a2f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chloe24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
