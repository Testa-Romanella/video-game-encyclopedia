I've never made something for a game jam before and I saw that this was non-competitive. With school coming up, it worked out perfectly. This is a 2d platformer where you collect cartridges to get to a tv. It only has one level but I may add more levels in the future as I\u00a0improve on my programming and unity skills. For some reason you have to double click on the instructions and credits buttons on the main menu to access the panels. You only have to single click to play the game and quit. I'm still working on that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e4683ae5f51ec57d75144abfdf606337.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Linh Nguyen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
