Mix the correct mushrooms to get an anti zombie or anti village potion. Pick up and place outside the door to ward off that enemy type. In a pinch you can fire a basic spell with Space to eliminate a single enemy.<br/><br/>---</p>\n<p>This game was produced as a proof of concept for my upcoming standalone game engine. Interpreted lua code and images are bundled into a zip and embeded into the binary itself. You can explore lua commands by hitting ~ to open the console. Engine commands will be listed at a later date.<br/><br/>As the engine was the biggest priority the game development itself suffered from it, as such this early early early version of the game is barely playable. The sound system is yet to be complete so no effects or music has been created yet,\u00a0Stay tuned for patches and more content down the road!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T14:20:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6cccf792b06c046259c6bc93c01174b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["makeavoy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
