I know it doesn't really work. I worked really hard, but when working today everything kind of stopped working. I was using arrays to make the objects spawn, and when making the shop(which doesn't work) I tried to add to the array and everything broke from there. Different items are supposed to be worth different points, but errors kept popping up. I'm going to try to fix it eventually, but we were on a time limit.\u00a0It would be great to hear your feedback!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:48:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/487/487575bb5152880019e12616afe84f5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheGloriousGecko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
