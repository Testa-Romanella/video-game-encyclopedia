You play as Frank, a chicken who hates other chickens. Always wanting to be more than just a chicken in the eyes of his turkey brethren, Frank turned to science.\u00a0Frank\u00a0learns that his turkey \"family\" will be cooked and eaten on Thanksgiving day.\u00a0 Powerless to stop it, Frank builds a ray to revive the turkeys in hopes of creating a rebellion to stop the farmers from ingesting his kin. Collect the keys to open doors around the farm, revive Frank's \"family\"\u00a0and drive off into the sunset...or away from the truth of who you are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>First collect the \"revivify ray\"\u00a0located directly outside of the chicken coop. Collect the keys hidden around the farm (one cranberry, one lemon, and one sugar), revive five turkeys and flock to the truck to complete your mission and find inner peace!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c472773fe03b24223570579b0670044.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ohhm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
