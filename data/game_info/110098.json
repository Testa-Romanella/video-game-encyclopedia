Based on the multi-layer gameplay concept from ATUM, we use Leap Motion and Oculus to create a highly immersive environment for players instead of using traditional point-and-click gameplay. It brings a novelty take on the hand interaction gameplay and combines it with platformer puzzles. </p><p>This game represents a further step in bringing virtual gaming closer to the real world interaction.</p><p>Trailer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3zJgaHwg4s</p><p>-----<br/></p><p>v0.8 Update Note:</p><ul><li>Update Leap Motion Libraries (2.2.0). </li></ul><p>-----<br/></p><p>v0.7 Update Note:</p><ul><li>Voice begins after dismissing Oculus Rift disclaimer</li><li>Apps can not be started in non-VR mode.</li><li>ESC to exit game</li><li>Correct opening dialog</li><li>Disconnection message when the Leap Motion Controller is disconnected</li><li>App window is titled correctly</li><li>App use the most recent Leap Motion libraries</li><li>Mac Executable file named correctly</li><li>System Requirements contain Minimum Hardware Requirements for the application in the App Store</li></ul><p>-----</p><p>v0.5 Update Note:</p><ul><li>Update LeapMotion SDK2.0</li><li>Add re-center command for Oculus (Ctrl + C)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48e/48e3b12610ee0094c1bad6a7c1f4151f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["huw12313212"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
