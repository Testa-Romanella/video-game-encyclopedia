They collect samples from all over the known galaxies to compare improvements of each generation. They kidnapped Andy as a sample from our world and put him with other samples into a station to test some skills that are observation, analytical intelligence, eye hand coordination, weakness, etc. Andy will meet a friendly robot here, and they will be sidekicks.<br/>\r\nThe station is in the middle of a black hole and consisting of connected cubes. You can go up which is down. But the VR headset always corrects the angle of view. <br/>\r\nIn the game your choices matter and you will have a chance to try so many VR interactions and experiences. Space time dilation, gravity-free environment, a robot friend, tough decisions and so many surprises will be in the full version of the game.<br/>\r\nSave Andy! And do not provoke Tisafolians!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T02:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f66/f66d4d9845865888644161a0276920c1.jpg", "website": "http://insidethecubes.virmode.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ViRmode"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ViRmode"], "esrb_rating": null}
