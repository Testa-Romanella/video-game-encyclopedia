In this casual game, you will help the residents of Teetering Towers grow their community by selling pies.

But don't wait too long, or the pies will go bad and be thrown in the alley -- and that raccoon is big enough already! As you sell more pies, your tower will grow taller and taller. How high will your pies rise?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls: Left Click to select pies, mouse wheel to scroll up or down the tower.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T04:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/644/64474b6b7cf7e03a65d60a2d04f0a7a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Nocturnal Wisp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
