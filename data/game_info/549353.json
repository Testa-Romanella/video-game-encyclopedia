You can also choose your own path through the game by selecting different planets leading to unique stages, each with their own gameplay and style. This game is a spiritual successor to one of my previous works, The Bits That Saved the Universe. Revisit the universe of bits with a new and improved art style, new engine and original soundtrack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a complete overhaul of the original with all new planets and areas, but still keeping the same four-player co-op fun. Travel to different planets and engage in different environments, different play styles and unique enemies!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI'd strongly recommend using a gamepad, perferrably an XBox type controller, especially if you're playing with multiple people. The game will natively detect gamepads, but if it doesn't work, you can use a controller to keyboard mapping program like Joy2Key or AntiMicro.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have to use a keyboard, here are the controls:<br/>\r\nPLAYER ONE:<br/>\r\nArrows - Move<br/>\r\nX - Jump<br/>\r\nC - Shoot<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPLAYER TWO:<br/>\r\nWASD - Move<br/>\r\nN - Jump<br/>\r\nM - Shoot<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs always, good luck and have fun!<br/>\r\nJ.C.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T15:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ec50a74dec1a03c9b5feda121b63905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["James C Gray"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["James C Gray"], "esrb_rating": null}
