A big One Though...<br/>You will have to dig your way through it and destroy its core.</p>\n<p>You control a mighty white dot, you can do Only One thing : Give commands to the swarm of braindead ships orbiting the enemy.<br/>\u00a0- Hold \"A\" or \"LeftCtrl\" will order a flee manoeuver, the swarm is too stupid to dodge incoming hazards so this will come in handy.<br/>\u00a0- Hold \"B\" or \"LeftAlt\" will order a volley of lasers, this proves to be deadly effective, although the enemy shields WILL Reflect most lasers... So this could be the best way to destroy you own swarm.<br/>\u00a0- Hold \"X\" or \"LeftShift\" will order an EMP bombardment which can disable shields for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>Have Fun, waiting for feedbacks !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T19:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e4/1e4fcec4867a644d3d01975d8067441e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaosklown"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
