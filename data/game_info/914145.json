I've got a good idea of what it'll entail and I'm transitioning out of the prototyping phase. anyway, until then, have fun with this little project!</p>\n<p>Windows notes:</p>\n<p>Windows will tell you that it's by an unknown publisher. press more info then press run anyway to play it.</p>\n<p>macOS notes:</p>\n<p>Ignore Gatekeeper warnings by opening Finder &gt; Navigating to the application &gt; Right click &gt; Open &gt; Open.</p>\n<p>Linux notes:</p>\n<p>Only supports 64-bit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T11:22:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63f/63f8633670602f79c12a1c58e7ad2e19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ported_From_Scratch"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
