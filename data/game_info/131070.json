At least it works! (The assets will likely be reused for<br/>a legitimate RPG adventure title that is in planning.)</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: You are Aomaru, or Ao-kun for short. You are a ninja -- or at least<br/>you're training to be one. One day while you were away from your home village,<br/>it was besieged by the undead! A particularly nasty one that goes by the name<br/>of Guy Kotsu is patrolling the mountains and woods searching for you -- to<br/>KILL YOU!</p>\n<p>As the surprisingly agile skeleton scrambles over mountains to remove your\u00a0<br/>entrails, you remember your training - by gathering all four of the Mystic<br/>Elemental Scrolls and returning them to your home, you can prepare the\u00a0 magic<br/>that can exterminate the undead threat! Good luck, Aomaru!</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong>: ***Use Joystick Port 2***<br/>Move the joystick to move Ao-kun and press fire to throw a shuriken. You can<br/>have three shurikens on-screen at a time. Hit Guy with the shurikens to stun<br/>him for a few brief moments. Be careful, sometimes he is barely stunned at all!<br/>Move to the edge of the screen to move to the next screen. Walk over scrolls<br/>to pick them up, once you find them. Once you have all four, return to the<br/>start position and walk over the town to win!</p>\n<p>If you are touched 3 times by Guy, you die and the game is over. Press fire to<br/>restart your console. A failed game over differs from the winning game over by<br/>being a black screen instead.</p>\n<p>Craptastic \"features\":<br/>-No VBlank! Saves a whopping 1kB of memory!<br/>-No game loop! Game overs conveniently restart your C64!<br/>-Only one enemy!<br/>-No title screen!<br/>-No music or sound!<br/>-Random stun duration!<br/>-Barely different killscreens for win or lose!<br/>-Inaccurate, sticky collision!</p>\n<p>Craptastic bugs:<br/>-Guy is invincible around x position ~255, but not to the left or right of it<br/>-Shurikens fly off into the gui at x&gt;255<br/>-Clear screen subroutine doesn't quite clear the screen</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0===---===---===---===<br/>All graphics and code (c)2018 by @_fou_lu<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0===---===---===---===</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f8/3f8d6139fb37d32c28bc36f695810cf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tekkamansoul"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
