Coax the cat of your choice to be the first to cross the finish line!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Choose which of the eight cats you think will win the race. They are all identical so feel free to chose to your favourite, but don't rely on them to win on their own. Use the items at your disposal to make sure the cat of your choice leads the litter.</p>\n\n<p>Cats love that fishy smell, so\u00a0use fish to lure a cat to a tasty treat. But be warned, who knows how long it will take them to chew the fat.</p>\n\n\n<p>Cats are truly terrified of cucumbers. Place one in a cats path and watch it run in the opposite direction.</p>\n\n<p>Be warned, cats are fickle creatures. There is always the slight possibility that they'll ignore what's in front of them. Such is the carefree life of a cat.</p>\n<p><em>This is our first ever released game, made for the Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam 2020.
