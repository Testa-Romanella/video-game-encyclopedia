In this game, the players have to control a bird, moving continuously to the right by flying between rows of different traps without hitting them. The bird falls because of gravity.</p><p>You will earn one point in each correct move. Medals are awarded for the score at the end of the game. A bronze medal is for those scoring between ten and one hundred. Who reaching 100 points or higher than 400 points will get a silver medal and gold medal respectively. Many people are mad because they cannot get more than 10 points.</p><p>Click on the <strong>left button of the mouse</strong>, or use your <strong>spacebar</strong> to get started. Fly the bird as far as you can without hitting a pipe.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/069/0699e37ac43ee65c5531186d5d4f9eed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ashraf"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
