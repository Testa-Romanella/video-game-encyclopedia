SUPER DUPER only works during PIA LOVE.\r\n</p>\n<p>3) A fun alternative to the two options above is to use the ZOOM BOOM which is activated by holding down the Middle Mouse Button and (when ready) releasing it, this will also teleport you to Pia's location. ZOOM BOOM only works when PIA LOVE or SUPER DUPER is not in use.\r\n</p>\n<p>Loving 10 Pias will allow you to rescue a puppy from their cage box, there are 5 puppies in total.\r\n</p>\n<p>The puppies are grateful to be rescued and will help you in loving the Pias and finding their unrescued puppy friends.\r\n</p>\n<p>Rescuing all 5 puppies and loving all the Pias will win the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Have fun and thank you for playing Pia Pandora - Puppy Rescue.\r\n</p>\n<p>* Best Windows screen resolution for a smooth running game is\u00a0<strong>1280 x 720</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T15:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/128/12846cd9914b31fbc0b1363b34abf624.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pia Pandora"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
