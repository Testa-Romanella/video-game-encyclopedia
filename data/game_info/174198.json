It is a top-down version of the Nazi Zombies from Call of Duty: World at War. I created all the sprites except the fire animation and the gun icons. The music and most of the sound effects were taken from online. I don't own them. Instructions on how to play will be displayed when you launch the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab9dcc7a69fb3de9ea04b5df0b04b4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MagicMantis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
