Let's play some minigames! Accomplish your destiny!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The end is nahual: If I may say</strong> so is a game about nothing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Okay look I'm not going to get into spoiler territory, but that is the gist of it, even though you are mostly made out of nothingness that is filling every space between the atoms inside you, being part of you, consuming you, forcing you to read this, forcing you to change... Is that not a reason enough to be scared? What will you do with that knowledge? Will you embrace it or reject it? Should we do something about it? or do what we're mostly filled with? Nothing...<br/><br/>I mean, even if you're a bunch of something... Does the empty space matter less? It's less matter, but does it matter less? Does the space between the letters matter less than the words themselves? Let's just show you an example, can you read and define the following text: <br/>\"Nelianikikneliasensontleikuika\" <br/>Okay... Did you understand it? most of you probably didn't and you know why? Lack of empty space... see my point?<br/><br/>So anyway, a witch fled after trying to kill the nahual queen, I mean she failed, but who hasn't failed to kill a nahualic queen, a relatable thing to which anyone, even Steve can relate... <br/>Then there is this nahual princess called Sammael, which doesn't use her original name anymore, she wants to feel safe, she wants to obliterate humanity because we have been naughty, or you know at the very least, just become really hard to kill, which will help her too...<br/>...And Jacob.<br/><br/><br/><br/>They'll talk with you, they'll ask you how your day was, and not care too much about it, and they'll follow your lead, you will be the enabler in their stories, you'll help them get to the end and I will know if you did, steam has an achievement percentage public to everyone, at least get one of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fight anything from trash bags to evil spirits, solve puzzles with puns, evade pi\u00f1ata's sticks, and use literally nothing to win.<br/><br/>Okay, so we could divide the game into three sections:<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Puzzle ones:</strong><br/>In the first one, you would get challenged by puzzles, like weird ones, like combining the (speed of light)\u00b2 with something else, I don't remember well as I haven't played the game yet, I'm from the marketing team... Also, use some salsa for motivation or accept your actual value in this world and use it to your advantage.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Action ones:</strong><br/>In this section, you'll have to evade projectiles and stabs unless you want or need to be hit, then do what you want... <br/>Counter attacks, use your hips, destroy your spacebar<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Visual Novel threes:</strong><br/>For the visual novel aspect, you'll either have to read it or skip it, the choice is yours.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Get to the end:</strong><br/>Get to the end.<br/></li><li><strong>Get to the end:</strong><br/>Get to the end.<br/></li><li><strong>Get to the end:</strong><br/>Get to the end.<br/></li><li><strong>At the very least defeat the trashbags:</strong><br/>We will know... we always know...</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T05:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/592/59246c6ef474c35cb60cc8a666237cce.jpg", "website": "https://thirdworldproductions.com.mx/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blasawebo", "Third World Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Third World Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
