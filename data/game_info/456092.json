The player has a number of arrows, which are fired at enemies to destroy them, and gain more arrows. Each arrow the player is holding decreases their speed, but running out of arrows or colliding with an enemy will cause you to explode.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n<ul><li>WASD: Movement. More arrows, more slow. You can wrap around the edges of the screen by moving off them, but keep in mind that enemies can also do this.</li><li>LEFT MOUSE: Hold and release to fire a single arrow. Very short range.</li><li>RIGHT MOUSE: Hold and release fire all arrows. Range depends on how many arrows are fired, and will leave one left.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-19T04:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a86b1b5df3ce000b3e94cf6a80af7ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunfire"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
