We  also know that you are now reflecting on how totally meta it is that you  are reading a description about reading a description. Well, now that  you've had a taste of your mind being blown, we hope you are HUNGRY FOR  MORE BECAUSE YOU'RE MIND IS GONNA BE SUPER BLOWN WHEN YOU PLAY OUR  NEWEST COOLRADICALIST GAME, \"LOW TIER HERO!\"\r\n </p>\n<p> Sure, some \"other companies\" might try to get you to play <em>their games</em>  by using the description section to list the features of the game and  try to do the game an injustice by attempting a botched translation of  the gameplay into \"<em>words</em>\". Well, we ain't fallin' into that  deathtrap (espeically because we used up most of our extra lives testing  if the bottomless pit called \"getting a job making games for free\" was  indeed, bottomless\") You want to know if you should play this game?  That's easy. \r\n </p>\n<p>The answer is, yes. \r\n </p>\n<p>You're  welcome! We saved you time, spoilers, AND having to think! (to be fair,  having to put this indescribable game in the catagory of RPG is already  too much of a spoiler, but not a spoiler spoiler. Like, if this game  was an apple, you could still eat it, but it's not as fresh as if you  stole it from your neighbor's yard) Now you can use that time and  thinking playing our game! Hurrah! You already are a winner for making  the correct life choise (but not as much as a winner as you COULD be  BEATING OUR GAME!) Now is the chance to make lights flash on a screen by  pressing buttons in order to pretend you are a HERO! Specifically, a<strong> LOW TIER HERO!!!</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T05:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6f0335b1f599bf6f86fd2951a591450.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balloon Co."], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
