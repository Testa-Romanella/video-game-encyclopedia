You are not here to save Princess Zelda or defeat Ganondorf \u2013 you are here to sate your lust for smashing pots. Unfortunately, it will not be easy to do so \u2013 the villagers are fed up with your antics because do you know how long it takes to make those? You are a scourge who cannot be stopped. In order to preserve the pot supply, they have created a labyrinth made up of walls and crates to protect their precious pottery. To reach them, you will have to move aside crates in a specific order, but beware: it can be easy to get stuck and when that happens, you\u2019ll have to start over! You\u2019ll have to navigate fifteen levels of unique mazes before the village\u2019s pots are depleted. Good luck, you savage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6abc26632718d63a9ba2d72a859fb892.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lauren Smetzer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
