Switch between Shine's add-ons to solve puzzles that redefine what bullets can do. Guide projectiles through intricate mazes, electrify damaged equipment to discover new pathways, and juggle 8-bit fruit because why not?<br/><br/><strong>Get Ready to Respawn</strong><br/>Don't let the cute character models fool you, saving Gamearth won't be easy. Prepare to dash flurries of missiles and avoid unseen traps as you fight to prevent its destruction. It's going to take all you've got to stay alive in the face of lethal robot armadas, enormous bosses, giant death wheels, and (of course) brainthirsty zombies. You're not gettin' through this in one piece, kiddo.<br/><br/><strong>Next Level Detail</strong><br/>Enter a world where every level is a single, continuous work of art. Each level is composed of hand drawn illustrations with multiple parallax scroll layers so every forward step is new; no tiling or repeated elements. This meticulous attention to detail allows each frame to flow seamlessly from one to the next, a quality you'll wish you had on your 20th respawn.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-20T09:26:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35c/35c0b812a300aa114d757e5e279ec884.jpg", "website": "http://www.supermegateam.com", "rating": 3.34, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 28, "owned": 527, "beaten": 21, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 13, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 37, "ratings_count": 58, "suggestions_count": 534, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 59, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Adult Swim", "Super Mega Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Adult Swim Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
