The constraint fits perfectly the theme,\u00a0 I literally ran out of space making this game. Moreover the main mechanic is about building turrets on the few available spaces you got, the more you build, the more you run out of space... It was my first time time using pico-8, and it was awesome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d9366a3d843ef2b793466d6be842456e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Darenn Keller"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
