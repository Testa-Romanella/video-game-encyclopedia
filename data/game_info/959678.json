As you find yourself stranded on a deserted island, your mission is to collect the fuse that will unlock the power source and allow you to escape.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>To achieve your goal, you'll need to use a range of tools and techniques, including a hover board that allows you to glide across the island, cubes and pads that can be moved and stacked to create new pathways, elevators that can take you to new heights, and togglable walls that can be switched on and off to reveal hidden passages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>But be warned: this is no simple scavenger hunt. Each puzzle requires careful planning and precise execution, and your success depends on your ability to manipulate the laws of physics to your advantage. Whether you're using momentum to launch yourself to new heights or using gravity to shift the environment around you, every move you make will have a tangible impact on the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So if you're ready for a brain-teasing adventure that will challenge your mind and test your skills, then put on your VR headset and get ready to embark on a journey through the Electric Enigma.<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T03:52:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c45/c45a2618c4c9a0b461a6907fd4b281c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 371, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alex VR"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alex VR"], "esrb_rating": null}
