The theme was \"Roll of the Dice\"</p>\n<p>In this game you play as a chicken that rolls around and shoots eggs at corn.</p>\n<p>We decided to interpret the theme to be about randomness. As such, we came up with a simple game and added a random element to it. Every 15 seconds, you get a little surprise!</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Mouse &amp; Keyboard:\u00a0Use WASD to move and the mouse to aim.\u00a0<br/>Controller: Use left stick to move and right stick to aim<br/><strong>Note that you still need a mouse to navigate the menu!</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made entirely using our custom game engine, BananaTechnology. This is the first publicly available game made with the engine.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the assets were made during the 48 hours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The idea for the game was inspired by chaos mod, a mod for GTA 5 that applies random effects to game similar to the ones used for our game jam submission.</p>\n<p>If you like this game, make sure to check back after the rating period of the game jam\u00a0for more content!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb2/bb289bd0287f8aa560f7596d9c5ab3be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bananabox"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
