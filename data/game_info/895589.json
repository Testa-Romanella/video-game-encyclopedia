For some reason, the WebGL build kept failing (maybe because I'm running Unity on Linux). I tried finding a solution for the problem online, but couldn't make it work. I provided the Windows, Mac and Linux builds instead.<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0made\u00a0the\u00a0following\u00a0modifications\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0original\u00a0instructions:</p>\n<ol><li>Added Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter</li><li>Added Mars and Jupiter moons with existing textures from the project</li><li>Moved the camera slightly above the solar system plane to give it a better view</li><li>Adjusted a few parameters such as sound source falloff, comet speed and frequency, etc. to my liking</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Matija &amp; Adam H.
