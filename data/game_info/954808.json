If the sniper kills too many civilians or just can't do the job in time the sniper loses. The sniper has a radar which will turn yellow if the crosshair is close to the agent. If it's red it is far from the agent.</p>\n<p>The agents job is to stay alive for 2 minutes. The agent will have to blend in in order to not look <em>sussy.</em></p>\n<p>The game is played by 2 people with the same PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f0a8913c570e81b72050a9daa1849e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["euiqlid"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
