The time was well spent, and I hope you all enjoy. The game includes the main heroic protagonist, Dani, and the despicable antagonist, the Evil Orange Juice. He is strong, bit you are stronger. You must keep fighting his minions that will progressively get stronger. It starts out easy, but you quickly realize it's a lot tougher than you thought.\u00a0 The game includes tons to offer. It will keep you entertained for hours! Don't let me spoil the game for you though, go play the game right now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:27:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090aaa18366ef5620216d776e561f88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrpotatopie"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
