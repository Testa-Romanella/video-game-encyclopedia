The opening sequence I had planned (which is completely different from the main gameplay) wound up being a bit of a beast, so I thought I'd throw it up as a demo.</p>\n<p>The final vision for the project is a 3rd person, free-roaming quest to raise funds by a certain deadline (think GTA meets japanese dating sim) with the catch being that this is a town full of hot women and your precious balls are just about the only marketable thing(s) you have to offer. I'm sure it will end well! /s</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, enjoy this tiny slice of interactive cutscene. Incidentally, given the effort it took, I'd be happy to make an entire game in this format if it's something anyone would be interested in...</p>\n<p>Also, sorry for such a weirdly massive file size! It's tough to exclude assets for builds in Unity, so all of the resources for the final game are stuffed in there.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Up Arrow - UP</p>\n<p>Down Arrow - DOWN</p>\n<p>SPACE - SELECT</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:21:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bba7c6912addc232bda0b15b4f8e128.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["GroinPainGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
