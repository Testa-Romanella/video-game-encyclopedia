For two to six players (with some light tweaking, up to 16 players, ask me and I'll tell you how), if you didn't have a grunge before playing, prepare to have one after.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is super simple; select how many players you have, select how many blobs you want, select max score and play! Everything is controlled with WASD, controller support can be modded in super easily (again, just ask me and I'll get you started). The goal is to have your blobs as close to center as possible while keeping everyone elses from being in\u00a0 the center.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: This is a finished unfinished game. I will not work more on it (unless convinced) and I think it's still good enough for some fun to be had, so that's why it still gets released. Expect some jank, and no audio.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why am I\u00a0telling you to ask me instead of just implementing it myself= Well, I've been working on this for wayyy too long and I'd like to be done someday. So I'm just releasing this as is, iithout any extra touchups. I'm too tired of it to continue, but I can surely help you out if you want to finish it up, for whatever reason you might want to do that. So just send me a message and I can send the sourcecode :3.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T13:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d2d4d70a9c3386058f5fbcaec3b5e03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wistpotion"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
