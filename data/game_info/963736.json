From rocket payloads to solar panel yield, every element in the game is based on real-life characteristics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As you build and expand your space base, you'll need to plan an efficient layout and increase its capabilities through new buildings and machinery. Use rovers to do the heavy work at first, and then bring in astronauts to live and work on the base. As you grow from an uncomfortable shack to a small village, develop businesses to make your base self-sustaining.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But building a space base is only half the challenge. You'll also need to protect your astronauts from the hazards of space, such as radiation and space dust, and ensure their mental and physical well-being.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With a realistic time scale and the option to play at different speeds, Outer Space Shack offers a unique and challenging gameplay experience. But don't worry, the game has been designed to be relaxing and easy to play, with as much automation as possible and no need to worry about placing cables and pipes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Celebrate your space odyssey with a visit to the in-game space museum, and remember the struggles and triumphs of your journey.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T05:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/faddee6f63dc3edc15c7aa1d5b8f89d0.jpg", "website": "https://outerspaceshack.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 292, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Open Lowcode SAS"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Open Lowcode SAS"], "esrb_rating": null}
