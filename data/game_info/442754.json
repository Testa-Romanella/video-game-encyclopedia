You got thrown into a dungeon cell, your magical orb just out of reach to taunt you. But your captors didn't know about your magical bond with the orb. Escape your cell, find a number of new abilities and loot the castle's treasury while you're at it! There's several ways to get there, can you find them all?</p>\n<p>We think it could be a cool basis for a VR metroidvania (the list of potential \"tool uses\" we descoped for the jam is a lot longer than the ones that ended up in the game). We hope you're gonna have a ball with it!</p>\n<p>Requires SteamVR and is only tested with an HTC Vive and Oculus Rift S. Other headsets should work if you set up control bindings, but the in-game instructions will refer to the standard bindings of these two\u00a0controllers (and may or may not refer to the Rift's joystick as a trackpad &lt;_&lt;).</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game Design and Programming by Paulo De Mello and Martin Ender<br/>Interior Design by Mender Berri<br/>Rendering Consulting by Pixelgrapher</p>\r\nUnity Assets used\r\n<p>Ultimate Dungeon Pack<br/>Unity Particle Pack<br/>Low Poly Rock Pack<br/>DOTween<br/>Procedural fire<br/>Stones and buried treasure<br/>Toon RTS Units - Demo<br/>SteamVR</p>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<ul><li>Not a bug, but just to clarify: there's no audio in this game.
