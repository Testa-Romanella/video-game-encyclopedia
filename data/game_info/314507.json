The first version was created by me in 12 hours, now the\u00a0 game in active development.<br/><strong>Plot</strong>: a group of random adventurers (such as a warrior, mage, thief and others) goes to the dungeon to try their luck, but the land is not as simple as they think...<br/><strong>Gameplay</strong>: your task - to get as deep as possible into the dungeon, simultaneously fighting monsters and collect artifacts. Monsters will become stronger and more tenacious, and artifacts - more and more expensive. And all of a sudden...<br/><strong>You died? It's game.</strong> For the money you received during the previous expedition you will be able to improve the next one, and so, time after time, until you meet with the <strong>King of the Dungeon</strong><strong>!</strong><br/><br/>All graphics are made <strong>100% by me</strong><br/>All code is <strong>100% made by me</strong><br/><br/>Since the game is still unstable, it may play too slowly. To increase the speed of the game run the fast version (its marked \"fast\" after the name. Normal game is marked as \"normal\" after the title.)<br/><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2ffecddeeeb54549933d0e9b65911633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["humdrumcrowd291"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
