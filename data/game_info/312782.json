Bing Baking is the new app from Acamar Films - creators of the award winning CBeebies show BING -  developed with Aardman Animations. For the first time, your child can be part of Bing\u2019s colourful and playful world by joining him and Flop in their kitchen for a joyful, fun and messy baking experience. <br/><br/>In this child-friendly, super-creative app, your Bingster will get the chance to make and decorate a new batch of biscuits each time they play. They can roll the dough or squidge it with their hands, using an array of cutters to make different shapes. Once their biscuits are decorated, they can be popped in the oven but you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on Chicky Timer to make sure the biscuits don\u2019t burn.  If they do, it\u2019s no big thing \u2013 you might not be able to eat them but you can still decorate them.  Don\u2019t forget to tap on the camera to take a snapshot of your yummy delicious treats before you and Bing sit down to eat them together.
