Created for Ludum Dare 38. Search for the ancient artifact across dozens of procedurally generated planets. Collect fuel to keep your ship running as you jump from sector to sector in search of the ancient artifact.</p><p>Apologies to Hello Games, any similarity to proper games of the same genre is done purely in good humour.</p><p>This game is a bare-bones prototype primarily as a learning exercise, however if there's interest I may continue to develop and expand on this as time goes on. There are bugs, it's desperately unfinished, but still a bit of fun. </p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>Known Issues:</p><p>- Palette is messed up on Windows - looking into it!</p><p>- Audio had to be disabled at the last minute due to DLL dependencies! Sorry, will try to get it re-enabled ASAP.</p><p>Find me on Twitter @rawktron</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee177decca52c62ee431533d3ecbc627.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rawktron"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
