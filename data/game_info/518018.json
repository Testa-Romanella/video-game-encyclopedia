However the board can be flipped and now it moves on the blocks that are down, but once the board is flipped, the current block will disappear.</p>\n<p>The game is made using Unity. All assets are made by me. The bear, wolf and blocks are made using Blender. The rigging and animation of the bear and wolf are also done by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T05:21:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d78/d78782d2de7d05dce7d7bc963584a8ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diyuse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
