The character is a OC of mine, Meg, a cooking student who has a big appetite.</p>\n\n<p>This game was entirely based on \"Yuletide Sophia\", by Hexalts, a very fun, and addictive game! I thought it was a great idea, and decided to make a new version of this game, with a OC of mine... Hexalt has a nice gallery, here is the link to his page on Deviantart, Itch and the link to his game</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Hexalt page</em>: (Hexalto)\r\n</li><li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Hexalt DeviantArt page</em>: (Hexalt)<br/>\n</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<em>Yuletide Sophia</em>\u00a0(Game): (Yuletide Sophia)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>Thank you for playing!
