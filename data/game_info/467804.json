A lone rancher must keep the herd of 100 bunnies together... or at least most of them. How many bunnies can you manage for five minutes?</p>\n<p>This game is my entry into the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. It's probably more of an interactive simulation than a game, but I had fun making it.

Honestly, given how much work this was for one person, I don't think this project would have been completed in time were it not for these assets, so huge thanks to Kenney.</p><p>EDIT: The source code upload I had was broken, but since the review period has started, I can't upload the correct ZIP. If you want to see the source code, you can download it from https://lrflew.com/Rabbit%20Wrangler%20Source.zip, but the builds available here are enough to rate the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:45:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65f/65f2cce727104c6b8a2bf936f2b0516e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LRFLEW"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
