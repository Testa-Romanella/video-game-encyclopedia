Use the powers afforded to you by multiple costumes to save Halloween candy from falling into the wrong hands (i.e. any hands but yours). Hone your skills with each play through to make each play better than the last. How much candy can you get?<br/><br/>You play as the eponymous Colette as she makes her way to each house along with the myriad of other trick-or-treaters. With your reflexes and Colette's costume abilities, rush to the houses to ensure the largest amount of candy will be remaining.
