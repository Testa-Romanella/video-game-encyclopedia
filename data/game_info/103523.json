It's my first Twine--my first\u00a0game of any kind--though I've been writing for a long time. I plan to update the game with graphics and sound over the next few months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <em>A Junk Drawer In an Empty Nest,\u00a0</em>you play a parent\u00a0rummaging through a junk drawer while rummaging through memories of\u00a0your child who recently moved out of your house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s strange how something as simple as junk, tossed aside and kept in a rogue drawer, barely ever opened, can remind you of someone you love so dearly. Simple everyday objects that you\u2019re pretty sure everyone else has in their junk drawer. But they\u2019re all the more meaningful when they remind you of the person you love.\" --Jupiter Hadley in\u00a0\u00a0<em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d36ea737632312ce9d5846cc6cf242f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jcarrwalker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
