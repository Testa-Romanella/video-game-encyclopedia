Used the Jet_Droid flying enemy art to create a new enemy behavior that can detect and follow the player within a certain radius. The enemy is animated and has its own health script so that it can receive damage from player projectiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Used Adobe Photoshop to create projectile pixel art that can be fired from the player at flying enemies. An appropriate script is attached to the player that allows the player to shoot as well as a script that is attached to the projectile that allows the projectile to actually damage enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Created three separate, unique levels that vary in difficulty in size.</p>\n<p>4. Used one the Sphere_Droid enemy art to create an animated obstacle that the player can use to jump on to avoid falling into acid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits: </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T08:22:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b827f96fa379b2ea5bb94cba271724b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["kirstyyalu"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
