You must find and become in tune with them in order to fend off the Evil. Too bad no one told you how much you need...</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>A labor of love, \"Save the Magics!!\" was developed in about a week, with the goal of making a wholesome, cute little idle game that you can enjoy at your own pace. <br/></p>\n<p>Obtain magical sources, recruit princesses, meditate, and more to build up your total Magics level. Who knows, if you build up enough, perhaps you can vanquish the Evil once and for all!</p>\n<p>Originally designed for the Byte-Sized Delights game bundle, so it's a very tiny-sized package.<br/>---</p>\n<p> <strong>Accessibility</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Only one button is required to play. On mobile, only a single finger tap is needed.<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Android<br/></strong></p>\n<p>An Android APK is included with your purchase.
