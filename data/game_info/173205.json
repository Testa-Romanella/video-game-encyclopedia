Looking for any feedback I can get on the weapon mechanics, sorry that there's currently only one gun at the moment but there will be some variety in the near future!</p>\n<p>Development is taking place with an HTC Vive, so if you have a Rift or WMR headset this demo may or may not run, I honestly do not know as of right now.</p>\n<p>MOTION SICKNESS WARNING: This game currently only has artificial sliding locomotion with no comfort options. If you are prone to VR sickness you'll want to avoid this game until I get around to adding comfort options and/or alternate locomotion methods.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52b/52be005d6ee319ffe051127cab13245a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PkBiggums"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
