Alternatively, toggle retro screen effects off by pressing \"R\"!)</em></p>\n\n<p>You are alone in space in an asteroid field. You have no engine, but fortunately you can move your ship by firing your weapons! However, your weapons are at the front of your ship, so that means your ship goes... BACKWARDS!</p>\n<p>The game is controlled using a mouse:</p>\n<ul><li>Move the mouse to move your targeting cursor, the ship will automatically rotate to face it.</li><li>Left mouse button to shoot.</li><li>Right mouse button to teleport to a random position on screen, which will also stop your momentum.</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally you can press P to pause and\u00a0R to toggle retro filters on/off.</p><p>This was made in around 8 hours for the GMTK Jam using Construct 2. Graphics made using Paint.NET, sound effects with BFXR and music with Abundant\u00a0Music.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>UPDATED (16/07/2017) - You can now press R to toggle retro filters on/off and browser playable version added!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48d/48dff4020523c2c09efc84734ac13847.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["rsbrowndog"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
