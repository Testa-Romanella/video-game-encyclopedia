I've done my best to make it playable in browsers, but if that isn't working, the standalone builds should run better. At least the Windows one should. Mac and Linux builds are unfortunately (again) untested...]<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game which started with an unrealistic scope and got larger over the course of development. It began as a story about fantasies, grew into a critique of meritocracy and accumulation, then became a melancholy late-capitalist walking-sim, and now I'm not really sure what it is. Because of its shifting focus and my shifting interests, I've been very tempted to abandon the project. Instead, I'm releasing it it in a rough (but roughly complete) form, mostly so that I'll feel less guilty about moving on to new projects. Hopefully people will find some of it interesting, especially now that expectations have been suitably deflated... As always, comments are appreciated, but I'm probably not going to spend much more time on this project.<br/></p>\n<p>The music's pretty chill, but I can't take any credit for that.
