We tried to prepare as best as we could, but against the endless waves of enemies there's nothing we can do.</p>\n<p>We'll evacuate all people to the Capital and regroup there. Perhaps we'll be able to mount a counteroffensive, but for now we must focus on delaying the enemy for as long as possible.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>In this simple roguelike / turn-based tactical game, you must roam the map and destroy approaching monsters before they reach your castle in the middle.</p>\n<p>Each enemy moves in a repeating pattern, moving for several turns, then resting. The icons on the left side of the monster will tell you how many turns it takes moving and resting. Use the knowledge to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Enemies also have varied amount of hit points and attack strength, shown with icons on their right. Attack strength means how much damage they'll do to you, just as you'll do the damage equal to your attack strength to them. Whether you attack the enemy, or the enemy attacks you, the other side retaliates immediately, so be careful when going after monsters with low health. Even if you survive attacking them, they will attack you again during their turn!</p>\n<p>If you need to regenerate your hit points, you can rest in place to gain 1 HP per turn. Moving near your castle and healing there will regenerate you to full health in one turn.</p>\n<p>Each enemy you kill grants you some experience points. Gain enough XP and you'll level up, increasing your hit points and attack strength.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>left mouse button\r\n  <ul>\n<li>on neighbouring empty tile - move to highlighted tile</li>\n<li>on neighbouring enemy - attack highlighted enemy</li>\n<li>on player character - rest and regenerate hp</li>\n<li>on the castle (when near it) - regenerate full hp</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Esc / P - pause menu</li>\n<li>mouse scroll - zoom</li>\n<li>right mouse button - drag camera</li>\n<li>WASD - move camera</li>\n<li>H - center camera on player</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T11:42:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e0/3e03bf3346bc94d80232707bb4762864.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucas Stark"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
