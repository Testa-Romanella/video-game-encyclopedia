{"id": 669584, "slug": "tiny-garden", "name": "Tiny Garden", "name_original": "Tiny Garden", "description": "<p>Grow plants in your garden and sell them for coins! Use those coins to buy more expensive plants! More expensive plants will take longer to grow, and will often require more water. Click and hold on a plant with the watering can selected to water it. You won't lose anything if a plant runs out of water, it just will not grow until watered. Additionally, plants that are thirsty will not generate profit when sold! Be careful about overwatering, however, as plants that are overwatered will not grow until they use up their excess water, and cannot be sold for profit. Enjoy!</p><p>This is a simple gardening game for my first ever game jam! There is no winning or losing, just relaxing and tending to your plants.\u00a0It was stressful to get everything out on time, but the idea of a simple gardening game really hooked me when they released the theme as \"calm\". Thank you to Micah Ball for the music, and to Zoe Blank for keeping me sane.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:41:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65da81e9df79f9446fc8274168bb58c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JLikeTheLetter"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
