Search for words by connecting the scrambled letters. Each word submitted is removed from the grid and the letters above fall into the gaps.  By tilting your device, you slide the tiles left or right and, with strategy, move letters to let you search for longer words.<br/><br/>In Timed and Relaxed modes, you score bonus points if you clear the grid of all letters.  No mean feat!<br/><br/>The starting grid is randomly generated, so no two games are the same.<br/><br/>Word Soup features 3 Single-Player Modes:<br/> - Relaxed, for stress-free fun.<br/> - Timed, to test yourself against the clock.<br/> - Brain Game, where long words mean survival.<br/><br/>and 2 Two-Player Modes:<br/> - Tit for Tat, for a quick turn based challenge on a single grid.<br/> - It's Blitz!, where each player has 90-seconds to max out a grid.<br/><br/>Local highscore tables track Longest Words, Best Words, Highest Scores and more.  Word Soup also features Game Center Leaderboards &amp; Achievements.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83edac45fb5bc6d0ad89553ab7703052.jpg", "website": "http://mobile.bigfizz.com/mobile-word-soup", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Fuzzy Bug Interactive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Fuzzy Bug Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
