The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari hunter who tries to catch an ape named Bongo. The hunter seeks Bongo to exact revenge for an apparent practical joke in which Bongo set fire to the hunter's tent, giving him a literal \"hot foot.\" The game was named by Peter W. Gorrie who was the CFO of Sega at that time.</p>\n<p>The game's ROM contains a message indicating it was likely coded at least in part by the company Ikegami Tsushinki.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-17T04:05:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a6fda3675b8c462da28519c0c51eb06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit", "Atari 5200", "Apple II", "Atari 2600"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
