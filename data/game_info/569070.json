I wouldn't have guessed), and picking up bubbles refills some of your oxygen.</p>\n<p>To finish a level, you need to eliminate all the enemies, then return to any platform.</p>\n<p>You can die if you get shot with no more lives, or by running out of oxygen with no more lives (zero oxygen consumes a heart and gives you some oxygen).</p>\n\n<p>That took waaaaaaay longer than I expected, but all in all, I've been creating new classes that I can use for future projects!
