If the robots go close to each other, they merge and cannot be killed by enemies. However, one of the robots goes on top, making you taller and sometimes blocking you from entering certain places, adding an immensely enjoyable element of puzzle along with the already-entertaining platforming aspect.<br/><br/>When the two robots are merged together, one of you will move left and right while the other jumps, forcing you to work together in an attempt to reach the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T11:35:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf074b79bf240ff63b14db182d5b091a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DelightfulHam"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
