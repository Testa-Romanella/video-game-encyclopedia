{"id": 46093, "slug": "charpi", "name": "Charpi", "name_original": "Charpi", "description": "Charpi is a new, exciting game that, despite its simple graphics and primitive controls, is quite complicated. Quickly pass the game does not work. Since when you touch the ball with the red mills, you have to start the level anew. It is not recommended to hurry in the game. If you want to practice your patience and perseverance, then this game is for you! Rules: When you get into the game, you get into a confined space with a lot of passes. And you need to get to the goal. The game has many levels. Believe in yourself and go through them all!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMultiplayer - We also plan to add to the game the ability to play with other players, so you do not get bored to pass levels alone. At the moment we are thinking how best to do this. Most likely we will have different options: games and everyone will find their own game mode, which will please and will not give you boredom.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLevels - the game is planned to make 1000 levels, so as not to get tired of the same thing. We will think through the levels and make them unusual. To make it more interesting to play light levels will be replaced by more complex ones and vice versa.<br/>\r\nWe hope you enjoy our game. And you will go through all the levels!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4f42500b62c75d9ebb850576c6ee2ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dasewner Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dasewner Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
