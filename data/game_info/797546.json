Their mission is to transport them to a specially constructed safe habitat to save these species in the face of global warming and water pollution. Having caught various species of intelligent and excitingly strange looking fish and, what the crewmates believe to be the most prized of their collection, a tremendous amount of rare fish eggs found in the deepest parts of the sea, the crew is on their way back to the surface.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then it happens! Someone spills coffee on the controls of the submarine, causing the submarine to malfunction and lose course for just a long enough amount of time for the submarine to scrape a large rock leaving a gaping hole in the submarine through which all the painstakingly collected fish flee and what's more, all the rare fish eggs are dispersed into the sea! Having no capacities to store the fish anymore since all the tanks are now broken, the crew wants to recover at least the fish eggs to ensure their mission wasn't a complete failure. But now the fish are warned and hostile towards the crew and even managed to bring the local fish to their side. Will the crew be able to conquer the dangers of the ocean floor in order to retrieve the eggs and bring them to the promised location?</p>\n<p>Curse of the Abyss is a two-player local co-op jump\u00a0&amp; run style platformer game with a twist:\u00a0the playstyle for each of the players\u00a0is asymmetric. On one hand, the player controlling the\u00a0diver needs to navigate through different environments in a jump and run fashion while collecting as many eggs as possible, being\u00a0attacked by multiple NPCs and having\u00a0to overcome many obstacles. On the other hand,\u00a0the second player has a supportive role and assists the main player from a submarine with its various different functionalities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T21:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd8/bd865b9f99d333f27001ba89d5f2962b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["curseoftheabyss"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
