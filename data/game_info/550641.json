You need to scroll down here to see them! Sorry for that.<br/>- Tooltips were planned but didn't get ready in time.<br/>- EMPOWER may lock up your game if both players fight the same card and it keeps EMPOWERing itself, causing you to be unable to progress to the Boss fight.<br/>- The BOSS Sprites are missing<br/>- There is no GAME OVER or WIN Screen yet. The game just stops and you can't play anymore cards if one player runs out of cards.<br/>- RESCUE isn't actually rescuing any cards from the Void right now, making the game a lot more challenging than intended.</p>\n<p>In Quantum Decks, you take on the role of two enigmatic spacefarers battling a threat to the entire universe. They must use their amazing quantum-powers to defeat iconic encounters such as The Enterspice or Sentient Meteors.</p>\n<p>Only teamwork and careful coordination will help them along the way. Play alone or with a friend over network!</p>\n<p>With 51 unique hand-painted cards and 16 abilities to learn and master, there is a lot of replay value.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Let us know in the comments what your favourite encounter or card is, and how close you came to defeat the powerful bosses!</p>\n\n<p>Each player's deck is called the ACTION deck. The cards available to play each turn is called the player's HAND. Played cards go into the VOID and become unavailable. The cards the players have to overcome are called THREATS.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Turn Order<br/><strong>AMBUSH Phase</strong> - Reveal a new Threat or BOSS if necessary<br/><strong>DRAW Phase</strong> - Both players draw up to three cards from their ACTION deck. If either player can't draw any cards, you both lose!<br/><strong>ACTION Phase</strong> - Both players select and confirm the card they want to play.<br/><strong>ATTACK Phase</strong> - If both players played the same type, add their strength values to each other. This is called a <strong>SURGE.</strong> Then, in turn order, execute the chosen attack cards and resolve their effects.<br/><strong>Dealing Damage</strong> - When the played Attack card matches the Threat's type, deal <strong>Strength</strong> damage. If they mismatch, deal one point of damage. If this reduces the Threat to zero, it is defeated and will be removed from play.<br/><strong>LOST Phase</strong> - The played card is discarded to the Void. All unselected cards are shuffled into the other player's deck.</p>\n<p>Card Effects<br/><strong>AMBUSH</strong> - When this Threat card is revealed, perform this action.<br/><strong>REVENGE</strong> - When this Threat card is defeated, perform this action<br/><strong>DEFENSE</strong> - Every turn this Threat card is not defeated, perform this action<br/><strong>SHIELDED</strong> - This Threat card takes no damage from Attacks not matching its type<br/><strong>ELUSIVE</strong> - This Threat will only take a single point of damage, regardless of the source<br/><strong>ATTACK</strong> - Perform this action before dealing damage.<br/><strong>LOST</strong>- When this card is not selected, perform this action in the LOST Phase<br/><strong>SURGE </strong>- When both players play the same type of card, they SURGE and add to each other's strength for this round<br/><strong>POWERSURGE</strong> - If this card SURGES, it becomes typeless for this turn<br/><strong>RESCUE</strong> - Shuffle a random card from the Void into the player's ACTION deck<br/><strong>RESURGENCE</strong> - If this card is played for the first time, shuffle it back into the ACTION deck instead of discarding it to the Void<br/><strong>BURN</strong> - Discard a random card from the player's ACTION deck to the Void, if possible<br/><strong>NEUTRALIZE</strong> - Ignore the text on the active Threat card<br/><strong>EMPOWER</strong> - The other player's Threat card increases its Strength by one<br/><strong>TRANSMUTE</strong> - Draw a new Threat card for the other player and replace the currently active one<br/><strong>QUANTUM SHIFT</strong> - Both players exchange their current ACTION decks</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Gameplay Programming, Design:\u00a0Raphael K\u00f6lz<br/>Design, Text:\u00a0Bj\u00f6rn Loesing<br/>Programming, Network:\u00a0\u00a0Tobias Kiehnlein<br/>Art:\u00a0Inka McAtee<br/>Sound and Music: daCrew (Andreas Buhs, Rainer Gebhardt, Stefan Gores)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T06:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb6/eb67aa1d969ae935439b87cb8771f369.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Fictions", "Inka_McAtee", "KnotHorn Studio", "TobiasKiehnlein"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
