First Game Jam for some of us. ^^</p>\n<p>Player one plays as Fairy Bitch, who is the leader of all good. Player two plays as Evil Snitch, the leader of all evil. Will the good manage to overtake the evil and make the world a better place for everyone, or will the evil be able to defend themselves and keep the power?</p>\n<p>You only need the keyboard to play the game. Player one uses W and S to move their cursor up and down, and they use C, V, and B to send out troops. Player two uses the up- and down-arrows to move their cursor and 4, 5, and 6 on the keypad\u00a0for their troops. They can also use J, K, and L if that's more convenient.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/66822ea566448a160fcd6d2bea112ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Mino53"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
