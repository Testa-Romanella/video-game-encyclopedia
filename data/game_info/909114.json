The little device's\u00a0extreme small size and tight hardware spec\u00a0makes it a\u00a0absolute challenge for both gamers and developers. That's why i decided to buy this handheld and make a game for it. And\u00a0I feel a great satisfaction when seeing my game somehow playable in such platform<br/><br/>The HTML version is an emulator version to share my creation, which emulates a raspberry pi\u00a0clip running micropython. It runs slower comparing the real device. Also, firefox doesn't support sound, and\u00a0incognito mode triggers error. It's recommanded to download this game into your Thumby through their Arcade platform</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Up/Down : Move<br/>./, : Enter<br/>Auto shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:22:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fb/8fbd39d4329cd13a4455ff0438ba5d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SunnyChowTheGuy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
