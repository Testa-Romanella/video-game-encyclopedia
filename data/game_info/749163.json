It's a prototype and I would love to get some feedback. That's it.</p>\n\n<p>Some word of advise:\u00a0Keep in mind it's a demo that provides a limited set of levels, no real ending, and bugs. No customization for key mappings at the time being. But if you ask politely I will provide you with a customized keymapping file.</p><p>Gamepad (nacon) uses the left joystick for movement, button 1 for jump, button 3 for shooting, and R2 for weapon switching. <br/><br/>Keyboard uses WASD for movement, space for jump, enter for shooting, and e for weapon switching. Keyboard has less fine-tuned movements and aiming capabilities. <br/><br/>Hit ESC to leave the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T06:51:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db8/db84dd2053aa5a9dc35fb0262817a187.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Liesch"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
