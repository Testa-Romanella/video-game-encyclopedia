A game heavily inspired in Crash Bandicoot.\u00a0Currently in Alpha version. This game has different levels where you have to collect an item to complete them. There are boxes in each of them, and if you break every box in a level you get a secondary item. There's a Time Trial mode where you can\u00a0try and complete the level in the fastest time possible to get an additional item.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This current Alpha version has 14 levels. These don't have visual elements (most things are primitive)\u00a0and their designs probably won't be the final versions.</p>\n<p>Readme included (both English and Spanish) with more information about the game, the levels, the boxes and everything else. This game can be played with Keyboard and Joypad.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Coding, Scripting, Level Design : Seb_tl</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Models : thatguy, Seafoam,\u00a0TwiIight_3D</p>\n<p>- 2D Art : irasutoya, Kitosdx</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Music : DOVA-SYNDROME, Hololive Productions</p>\n<p>- Sounds : https://freesound.org/</p>\n<p>- Special thanks : VCentral (and Lau)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>This is a fangame and is not affiliated with Hololive nor does it represent Cover Corp. and other labels under the company.
