Not necessarily because that much time has passed, but rather because the world suffered a cataclysmic event that turned the earth into mugen stages straight from some Hokuto no Ken game. When Kevin Rian, leader of \"The Police\", dies of a stroke, Juza makes a trip around the desert to gather his former comrades, their loot, and what their friend left behind. A touching story of friends, family and satanism.</p>\n\n<p>Note: This is a Dolmexica Infinite mod, which in turn is a Mugen interpreter for Windows/Web/Dreamcast.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls for Windows/Web:</strong>\n<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Arrow keys </li><li>Weak punch - Q </li><li>Medium punch - W </li><li>Strong punch - E </li><li>Weak kick - A </li><li>Medium kick - S </li><li>Strong kick - D </li><li>Start - Enter </li><li>Advance text during cutscenes - A</li><li>Movement during cutscenes - Arrow keys</li><li>Full screen: CTRL + Enter for Windows / F8 for Web (make sure to click game in firefox first or fullscreen will fail)</li><li>Return to title screen / Exit the game from title screen - Escape</li><li>Instant Win - F1</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls for Dream</strong><strong>cast:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement - D Pad or Analog stick</li><li>Weak punch - X</li><li>Medium punch - Y</li><li>Strong punch - L </li><li>Weak kick - A</li><li>Medium kick - B</li><li>Strong kick - R</li><li>Start - Start</li><li>Advance text during cutscenes - A</li><li>Movement during cutscenes - D Pad or Analog stick</li><li>Return to title screen / Exit the game from title screen - A+B+X+Y+Start (Standard Dreamcast combo)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Additional not</strong><strong>es:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>KFM character and stage made by Elecbyte:\u00a0http://www.elecbyte.com/mugendocs-11b1/mugen.html</li><li>Character sources: Juza, Principal of Otokujuku Edajima Heihachi, Giorno Giovanna, Kevin Rian, Kenshiro, Tsurugi Momotaro, Jonathan Joestar, Post-apocalyptic Emperor, Birdie, Miku, Bridget</li><li>Stage sources: Mamiya's village, Juda's stage, Generic ruined HnK city, Souther's pyramid</li><li>This is an in-development Mugen interpreter for Dreamcast, so all glitches, false behaviours and other uncanny stuff happening with the characters/stages are not the original creators' fault, but rather reflect this developmental status.</li><li>The more technical Mugen-on-Dreamcast stuff should go in this thread if possible:\u00a0http://dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=3320</li><li>The Dreamcast version does currently not support 50Hz mode, so please make sure your TV can display 60Hz (or use a VGA cable).</li><li>Source code is on\u00a0<strong>github</strong>:\u00a0http://github.com/CaptainDreamcast/DolmexicaInfinite/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!\r\n</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/0344402dfaaeccaadae1812f8fe51fde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Captain Dreamcast"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
