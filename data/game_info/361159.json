The theme was \"only one\" so what i thought was that the player would be able to run only in one direction. Even though the game is a bit short, I think there is plenty of room for further development, so this is a concept I will be looking on in the future. I will appreciate any feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:24:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/195/1950f80bd69f312429ce38ee0d59467a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ene Luis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
