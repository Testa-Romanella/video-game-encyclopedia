I casually worked on this throughout a few months in 2021, not really getting very far, and\u00a0never really thought I'd\u00a0<em>seriously</em>\u00a0ever release anything. Then around March of 2022, I\u00a0<em>randomly</em>\u00a0decided to start working on on this project again, which then escalated into becoming more of a serious reality.</p>\n<p>This first part was quite a lot of work (<em>...so...many...sprites...</em>), but even\u00a0if only a few people\u00a0enjoy reading it, then it'll have been worth it!\u00a0So far, this\u00a0is only\u00a0the first part of three, so please stay tuned!</p>\n<p>********************************************************************************<br/></p>\n\n<p>I've not done anything noteworthy on, or offline, so there's not a lot of history to talk about.\u00a0This is my first time creating and releasing anything as big as this, and while I've used the internet for quite some time, I've never really interacted much with any communites or people, so I'm still <em>extremely</em> new to all this.</p>\n<p>I've only used Reddit and Discord a\u00a0<em>few</em> times\u00a0(I still get nervous when posting online, or <em>even</em> just going into a Discord server!), and\u00a0I've never even used any other social media(aside from occasional Twitter scrolling), so <em>hopefully,</em> I'm doing a decent job.</p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************</p>\n<p>I've created a few accounts specifically for my creative presence, but don't be afraid to send an unrelated message if you've got something else you'd like to say to me!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0@YojiYonjuYonpun</p>\n<p>Reddit: u/YojiYonjuYonpun</p>\n<p>Discord: 444#2891</p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************</p>\n\n<p><strong>The original story and characters of \"Umineko no Naku Koro Ni\", were created by Ryukishi07 and </strong>07th Expansion<strong>. </strong>I'm simply borrowing those characters, and\u00a0 utilizing the original story's\u00a0framework for Kareru.</p>\n<p><strong>All artwork and music belong to their respective artists.</strong> I made\u00a0slight modifications to some sprites, but I do not take credit for drawing or composing any assets or music used in \"Umineko Kareru\".</p>\n<p>The engine used to make this game was Ren'Py, and as I know little to nothing about coding/programming, I must thank the many random posts scattered throughout the internet, which helped me figure things out for Kareru.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A big thanks also goes to RevivedReplayer/James's code within\u00a0Uminetta's forgery \"Purgatory of the Golden Witch\", from which I grabbed the framework code\u00a0for the UI, then modified, and made it fit\u00a0Kareru. This obviously helped speed things up tremendously, and made the coding process a lot easier!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>So</em>, the only thing I'll really take credit for is the writing, which was done solely by me.(As well as arranging and organizing everything, but that's <em>nothing</em> compared to actually creating the assets.)(<em>Although, that still took a super long time!</em>)</p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************<br/></p>\n<p><em>Whew</em>, hopefully that's everything. I apologize in advance if I've missed something, or didn't credit someone I should have. Since I'm working alone, it can be very easy to miss these things.</p>\n<p><em>Anyway</em>, if you actually read all of this, thank you! I wanted to be as thorough and transparent as I could for my first project\u00a0(especially since I have no idea what I'm doing!). Hopefully you'll enjoy reading this as much\u00a0(<em>or even more?!</em>) as I had fun making it!</p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>And finally</strong></em>, please feel free to livestream, let's play, twitter react, draw fanart, and/or share your experience/thoughts in some other way. If you do so, (<em>and you're comfortable with sharing it</em>) please message/tag me\u00a0@YojiYonjuYonpun, or use the hashtag <strong>#UminekoKareru</strong>, so that I can enjoy viewing/reading it!</p>\n<p>After all, at\u00a0<em>least</em>\u00a0half the reason for creating this forgery, was so fans of Umineko\u00a0(<em>and myself</em>) could experience more tales within this universe. So please, don't hesitate to share your thoughts, I'd love to read them all!</p>\n<p><em>(Also</em>, since I have <em>very\u00a0</em>little knowledge about the Umineko fandom\u00a0<em>(or any fandom)</em>,\u00a0if you know of any places where this game may be discussed, then please let me know, as I'd love to read any thoughts or discussions!\u00a0Thank you.)</p>\n<p><see a=\"\" again,=\"\" day!=\"\" have=\"\" nice=\"\" you=\"\"></see></p>\n<p>*********************************************************************************<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T11:10:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d46/d468ceb1ebadeb23a9fb50f2d9c6ed50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4\u664244\u5206"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
