Enter Covert Commando! It is a top down looter shooter that lends inspiration from games like Commando and Cannon Fodder. If you are old enough to have played these games you are already getting excited. If not, boy are you in for a treat! We want to combine this inspiration with more resent ideas from rogue likes: Procedural levels, upgrades as you play along and swift and merciless permadeath.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCurrently in very early beta so if you want to be part of the journey give it a try, give us your honest feedback and check back for updates. If you only want cream of the cream check back later for a more complete version.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:34:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c25363f56637b9f3f2b6fdbc24e9a6e.jpg", "website": "http://fourpixelsgames.com/homepage/index.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["fourpixelsgames", "Four Pixels"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Four Pixels"], "esrb_rating": null}
