{"id": 500126, "slug": "final-stardust", "name": "Final Stardust", "name_original": "Final Stardust", "description": "<p>This is my game prototype \u201cFinal Stardust\u201d, a turn-based 2D RPG game inspired mainly by Pokemon &amp; Golden Sun (also Yu-Gi-Oh).</p>\n<p>Special Mention: In case you are wondering about the Japanese part, I have been learning the language for 2 years so I added that just for fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did everything by myself so far(from scratch): The coding, the art and the music(voice acting too) but I don\u2019t excel in any of those fields. My main problem is that I only started game development a month ago. Based on my current skills, it would take me 2-3 years to create the whole game on my own. I have no problem building the whole thing myself(since I would learn so many new things) but I want to try something different as I just spent the last 2 years on an individual project.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I am looking for people that want to contribute to the making of a turn-based RPG. I know there are so many lazy and talented people out there who have x10 my level and who are just waiting for a small push, which is something that I can provide. Think about having your own art or song in a finished product. Maybe this is the project that you need to get more attention and sell your art, songs, or other services...who knows. I will share everything concerning the project on YouTube, that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stop wasting your time on making art or songs that become forgotten after a couple of days. You can add this game to your portfolio as well. It really hurts me to see all these people that make great Pokemon ROM hacks that take years to make only to get them taken down by Nintendo. Even if you aren\u2019t a developer, a designer, a music producer or have any technical skill, you are still welcome. You can help with the story, finding bugs in the game, naming monsters, motivating others, etc\u2026</p>\n<p>Everything has been documented on my YouTube channel so far and I will keep doing so which means that you will have the opportunity to follow the whole journey. I want to build the game with a community and document the whole thing. This journey will allow you to go through the making of a game from start to finish. I really don\u2019t understand why devs with a big following don\u2019t try to build something with their community instead of uploading some random devlogs of unfinished/small projects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main problem with devlogs is that you don\u2019t get to participate and I want to offer people that possibility. Image how fun it would be to name the places/monsters , choose the design, find ideas, etc...all together. I would love to manage a team consisting of individuals sharing the same interests. I just wish we had more indie teams who would share updates themselves instead of just adding some text on a webpage.</p>\n<p>For me Pokemon started dying after the black/white 2 versions(I still played all the games) and no one wants to do a game for Golden sun, probably the best JRPG of all time. Since I am torn between both I decided to combine both games and create something original. Heck even Yu-Gi-Oh died after 5d\u2019s(when you are used to Yusei then you see the next protagonists\u2026). I feel like the \u201cbadass\u201d aspect has disappeared in recent Pokemon games, I hope I am not the only one who thinks that. Anyways, let\u2019s build something together!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T05:38:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45c47524818d7a56910b3399c6e6843b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noursaidana"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
