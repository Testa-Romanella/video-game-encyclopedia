Players place either troops or towers on the grid depending on if they are an Attacker or Defender. Players can only play the game with controllers.</p>\n<p>The Attacker can only place troops on the right side of the map (8 columns from the rightmost side). Attackers use the gamepad to place 4 different types of troops.</p>\n<p>They can use the controller D-Pad (Directional pad) to decide what grid block they want to place the troops on. The different colored block that the gamepad cursor is highlighted on is the area that you can place the troop on. These troops will have different characteristics. Some are faster, some are slower and deal more damage. The 4 face buttons on the right side of the controller places down the troops. The attacker's goal is for a single troop to reach the other side of the grid (the leftmost part). If that happens, then the attacker wins and it goes to the menu screen.</p>\n<p>The Defender can place towers and walls on the left side of the map to defend against the attacking troops (12 columns from the left side). They can use the controller D-Pad (Directional pad) to decide what specific grid block that they want to place a tower on (The specific block will be highlighted in a different color). The 4 face buttons on the right side of the controller place down the towers. The \u2018b\u2019 button is for the cannon, \u2018y\u2019 for the ballista, \u2018a\u2019, for the rapid ballista, and \u2018x\u2019 button is for the wall. The defender wins by surviving until the timer runs out on the top of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Made by:</p>\n<p>Alex Rowlands</p>\n<p>Joshua Nunez</p>\n<p>Alec Shahverdian</p>\n<p>Charlie Xu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T06:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eeed82b229f3129ecd6aa4060ffd890e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CharlietheCoder"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
