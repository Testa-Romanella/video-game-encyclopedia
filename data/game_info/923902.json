But please, do give credit to me, it took me so long to find this and I know these are very high demanding versions of this game. Thank you In advance! :D</strong></p>\n<p>Includes all old versions of Baldi's Unreal Basics including the long lost V1.2.1! (The oldest version of this game that doesn't even have music added to the main intro cutscene yet! :O).</p>\n<p>Short story on why you can't get these old versions anymore: Soooo basically, when obsidious was making chapter 4 of Baldi's Unreal Basics, his computer gave out and he had to buy a new computer. Unfortunately, computers aren't like phones where all your files and games and photos are saved if you have to get a new phone, in which when obsidious's old computer went kapoot, it took the old versions of Baldi's Unreal Basics with it, leaving only the newer versions like the complete version or the remastered 1.5.0 version.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------\u00a0 \u00a0Breif Intro To game\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--------------------------------</p>\n<p>There's nothing worse than sleeping in. Although, when you sleep in you're usually missing important things, such as work, or school. But even then, you always wake up eventually.\r\n</p>\n<p>But..<br/><em><strong>What if you didn't?</strong></em>\n</p>\n<p>You, playing as George has fallen into a coma after a horrific accident, your childhood school running into a <em>terrible</em> fate. This isn't a dream. This is a nightmare. One that you will not wake up from.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my spin on the popular and great game Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning! The game still has a lot of stuff before it could be finished, and a LOT of bugs!\r\n</p>\n<p>Once again, credit goes to Obsidious! :D</p>\n<p>His youtube channel:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo616FTe_tWZQwsjwf38UVg</p>\n\n<p>Game link :\u00a0(1) Baldi's Unreal Basics (COMPLETE) by Obsidious - Game Jolt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T10:55:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2af/2af042a362f8f1d9591e8d303e958793.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodingMaster1106"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
