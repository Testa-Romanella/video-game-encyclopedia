The citizens of a village are all trapped in a dream world with only one way to escape: go deeper into the dream and collect all of the mementos. Then, the gate to reality will open. One by one, the villagers went down, deeper into the dream. None have returned. Now, it's your turn. This time, you're determined to collect all of the mementos to free everyone.</p>\n<p>Mementos is an entry for the Dream Diary Jam and is currently in the demo version. There are currently 4 mementos to collect, with a few worlds to explore. Future updates will come later on, but for now, this is what I could accomplish in a month.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68bb87da7a91b5e3f493ac180235482d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adanteallegro"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
