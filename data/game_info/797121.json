Survive and thrive, or don't. Oh no, now you're a ghost. But look, now you have lots of ghost friends. Maybe you can make more friends. Maybe you can make everybody be your friend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>\n<p>Your goal is to make as many ghost friends as you can as quickly as you can.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD or arrow keys</p>\n<p>Run*: Shift key</p>\n<p>Get in car*: Left click</p>\n<p>Get out of car*: Right click</p>\n<p>Un/Possess human**: Space</p>\n<p>*only works when you are alive or possessing the living</p>\n<p>**only works after you've died</p>\n<p><strong>My Intent:</strong></p>\n<p>To make a fun little game that would challenge me to learn things that I've been lacking, like character rigging, working with nav meshes,\u00a0menu systems, and to generally include as many standard game features as I could think of. This includes a settings menu and music, which I usually skip. There's also some very basic save functionality, another thing I've been meaning to work on more, in order to save a list of high scores. Though now that I mention it that may not be fully functional in the web version.</p>\n<p><strong>Random Factoid:</strong></p>\n<p>The car engine sound is a piece of cardboard in bike spokes.</p>\n<p><strong>FYI:</strong></p>\n<p>Made in 10 days for the 2022 Gamedev.TV Game Jam with the theme \"Death is only the beginning.\" Built in Unity 2020.3.6fl, along with Blender, GIMP, Audacity, Paint, and some other things like Fonstruct.com and Youtube tutorials. Source files are available at\u00a0https://github.com/Jamblefoot/Dead-With-Friends</p>\n<p>The WebGL build seems mostly functional, but tbh I haven't thoroughly tested it. Some shader stuff isn't working, but it's not essential. For the most accurate experience, try the Windows build if possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T18:12:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/073/07307f4c91c2fa3c01842ed7ab6c76c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jamblefoot"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
