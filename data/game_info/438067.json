You can collect resources, explore in underground caves, extract valuable resources, and build your home.</p>\n<p>SimpleTiles is currently in an extremely early state of development and has very little in terms of features/quality control. This is also my first legitimate Godot project (and my first legitimate 2D\u00a0project in years), so things might be a little rough initially. Early development builds may contain random menus or keybinds that a new user will not understand how to use, so read up on the devlogs for extra information.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T06:08:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/747a47fdc409d879cb926929f00731af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheSinkGod"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
