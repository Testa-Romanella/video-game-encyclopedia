The goal of the game is to get to 10000000 population, by surviving the attacks of the asteroids!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The planets and the music where taken from the assets store, while the rest of the art (asteroids, the logo etc...) was made by me. HOW TO PLAY: The first thing you need to do, is colonizing the first planet!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Once that is done, you can finally travel to the others once you reach 50 population! To travel to another planet, simply click on the travel button and click onto the planet you want to travel to The goal of the game is to get the highest population across all planets(you can see it in the upper right corner at all times while playing)\u00a0</p>\n<p>The more you travel, the more you increase your population! Pay attention to the asteroids though, since they will start going faster and faster over time!</p>\n<p>\u00a0CONTROLS:\u00a0</p><p>- LMB: interact\u00a0</p><p>- RMB: open menus</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T04:16:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c0/2c0ffd5f43d5c25b0417a597328379c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["GabrieleVierti"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
