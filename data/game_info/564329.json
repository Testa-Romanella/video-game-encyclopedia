There is an auto-battle system, so you push the adventurers through the dungeon to their inevitable defeat.</p>\n<p>As they lose battles, their generic class title gives birth to a name, and they grow stronger with each defeat. Different foes will give them new permanent skills for future runs.</p>\n<p>As you technically control the characters, this doesn't infringe on the Nemesis System's patent.</p>\n\n<p>This was made for #NemesisJam, and while there's a bunch of things I could have done better and wanted to explore more, it's not in a bad place as it stands. If this kind of game is worth expanding upon or adding to, please let me know.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T08:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf6/bf631243bc24737b3d81202c59bc771d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
