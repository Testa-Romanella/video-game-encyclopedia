{"id": 108402, "slug": "thought-police", "name": "Thought Police", "name_original": "Thought Police", "description": "<p>A neon-noir visual novel about interrogating witnesses, the latest in bio-sensor technology, and street violence. A post-production tweak of my Ludum Dare 29 submission, theme being Beneath the Surface. <br/> <br/>Content warning for blood and a handful of f-words. <br/> <br/>You play as Alexis Brambilla - a detective inspector for the richest and most technologically advanced police force in the world. You have been given access to their latest research project - an interrogation room that can give you real-time feed back on a subjects emotions. <br/> <br/>What might you uncover when you put it to the test? <br/> <br/>There are 3 bad endings and one true ending to find! Getting them isn't hard, but I hope you enjoy the experience, irreverent dialogue and probably unsubtle political standpoints. <br/> <br/>Words, coding, and backgrounds by Nathan Blades. Character art by Aryn Clark. Music is from Incomptech.org, and a brief clip from Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow. Sound effects are from freesound.org. <br/> <br/>Made in Ren'Py.
