Touch (or click and hold) the door (black rectangle) to unlock, and touch the wheel to lock it again.</p><p>The shafts are pinned to the wheel at one end, and these pins can rotate. The shafts slide through the far studs. In general, the shafts would push on the sides of the studs and force them to rotate, but if the pins fit loosely enough and the wheel doesn't have to rotate very far, you might get away with having the studs fixed and unable to rotate.<br/></p>\n<p>Fullscreen recommended.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a8951ecd00d1fe3600cbf2e29184c130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CalebBennetts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
