Instead of trying to hit the ball, you must dodge the ball as it follows you. Who ever reaches 10 first wins. You get a point if the ball misses, the ball gets a point if it hits you. Press the pause button to pause the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Use the W/S \u00a0or the Up/Down keys\u00a0to move up and down. You can change different aspects of the game in the settings menu, which can be found when the game is paused.</p>\n<p><strong>Downloadable Version</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://tobydev.itch.io/gnop</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T06:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b0/3b033fab0487e08c282cdcfd0c269d63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TobyDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
