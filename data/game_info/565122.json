Use the sword to attack enemies, and use the shield to defend yourself. If you die, you will be respawned at a random checkpoint (hence the jam's theme, failure is progress). This game is just a proof of concept, so don't expect anything too fancy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc05bde609a5146e4c1a3232a46fc69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Clamshell64"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
