Some of them feature some odd kinks, along with pictures, though I've added a control module at the start of the game, for those of you who don't want to see certain kinks and just want to enjoy what I've made. BEWARE HOWEVER, that if you chose to turn off certain kinks, you will not see certain characters and/or events.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is a day and night cycle, with night having no 'overworld' enemies to fight but having on screen monsters which will be tougher than that areas monsters.</p>\n<p>You will be able to access certain events only during certain times of day, so be warned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are bloodstones in the game, rare items which sometimes drop from enemies. You can take these to a special vendor in the market in town to get certain rare items.</p>\n<p>You cannot purchase weapons in the game, however you can buy certain base metals from the special vendor and take them to be forged in town. However, because bloodstones are somewhat rare, the sword you get at the 'start' of the game will grow in power with you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want anymore tips then please come onto my discord channel for this game.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/4kfgcbWtYg\u00a0&lt;- New Link<br/></p>\n\n<p>- - - - -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>Fixed Russ Bird Event.</p>\n<p>Fixed Minotaur Swordsman Event in town.</p><p>- - - - -</p><p>Fixed Sen face.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T16:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a09/a09600f9b4aac7940caa04da67fe9663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["KDM"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
