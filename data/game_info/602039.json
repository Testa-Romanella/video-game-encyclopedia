This way, I can explore the technical side of it\u00a0without putting too much time into design and asset creation.<br/></p>\n<p>For that purpose, Tom Clancy's The Division futuristic interface fit the goal perfectly.\u00a0\u00a0With its clean yet\u00a0stylized design with holographic effects, I manage to learn a lot about the UE4 widget and UI canvas logic,\u00a0material manipulation, and some post-processing workflow.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>The prototype itself is a template FPS level you can create in UE4 accompanied with UI systems and visual effects I implemented as well as some gameplay adjustment. It doesn't offer much gameplay-wise but I hope you would enjoy how the UI system and effects come together in this prototype.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:15:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f92/f9206e2e36b7b7c4fb451ee784e958a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Palmmy Palmmy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
