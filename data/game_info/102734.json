I might revisit it at some point and make an expanded version of it. <br/><br/>I used L\u00f6ve for the game engine, BFXr for sound, Abundant Music for music and Aseprite for pixel art.\u00a0<br/>If you are on OSX or Linux you can download L\u00f6ve here\u00a0and play the .love file!<br/><br/><br/>KNOWN BUGS: <br/>- The game gets really fast on some computers, apparently L\u00f6ve does not cap the FPS on some pcs. Still trying to fix it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4d/c4d81dac5f0a1a29c175443ebdc06e76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MiniBoss"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
