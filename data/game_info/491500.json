An intense rhythm game that equips you with sticks and blades and pits you against a barrage of balls generated by the music.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBalls come in two colours. Starting from empty handed, you grab a ball to charge a weapon for one shot. If you then strike a ball of the same colour you score a hit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStriking the other colour won't score immediately but will set the weapon to omni which can hit any colour. Final score depends on matching balls and weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe groove is automatically detected with fine detail from your own mp3 so you can enjoy your favourite music tracks while having a mental and physical workout.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game's difficulty is automatically adjusted in real time based on the player's performance making for dynamic, enjoyable and always challenging playthroughs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:28:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef7/ef7b4bade9b43618e422d044d15e56f0.jpg", "website": "http://www.yolopia.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yolopia"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Yolopia"], "esrb_rating": null}
