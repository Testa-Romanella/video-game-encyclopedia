Each player will find a way to convince T<em>he Three Dancing Kids</em> (Milly, Mae, and Molly) to follow him to his apartment building, where he plans to cook and eat them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game will follow the three kid sisters (Molly, Mae, and Milly \u2013 all baby goats, by the way) who received a dance scholarship from the prestigious Move Your Feet Dance Company in NYC (a fraudulent dance studio setup by Sly Fox to get them and other unsuspecting animals to NYC so he could eat them). Along with the scholarship are all-expense-paid vouchers: three train tickets, three rooms at a swanky hotel in the city, and a $500 gift card for food valid at any fine eatery in the area near the hotel (value of $5,000).</p>\n<p>Upon arriving on the train to the city, the three kid sisters met the fast-talking liaison for the Move Your Feet Dance Company \u2013 Sylvester Fox (Sly Fox for short). He convinced the kids to stay in his apartment building (free room and board) instead of the hotel. In exchange, he would buy the vouchers from them at face value. They were initially reluctant, but they relented and agreed to Sly Fox's terms.</p>\n<p>Sly Fox separated the kids into three different rooms and promised to take each of them (separately) sightseeing in the city before meeting the dance instructors at the Move your Feet Dance Company. Blinded by the skyscrapers and bright lights of the city, the three kids didn't realize what sinister plans to capture and eat them (just as he did with the other scholarship recipients before them). He didn't anticipate Milly\u2013the eldest of the three, to thwart his plan and fight to save her sisters from being boiled in a cauldron alive (think of the original story of The Three Little Pigs).</p>\n<p>This story is based on a series of children's books I wrote for Dr. Joshua Bagley's class. I plan to write it with branching dialogue (obviously) along with playable action sequences.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T12:31:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/7484230e2a20adc3f63ddf3986a8bda1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jedale"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
