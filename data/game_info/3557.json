{"id": 3557, "slug": "divekick", "name": "Divekick", "name_original": "Divekick", "description": "Divekick is the world\u2019s first two-button fighting game. It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick\u2019s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.<br/><br/>At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That\u2019s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It\u2019s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It\u2019s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. <br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.  <br/></li><li>Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!<br/></li><li>A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.
