In case it doesn't work in itch.io, you can play the game here :\u00a0https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedev-recycle-game</p>\n<p>Theme was Raw : We got the idea to go with a game about recycling. Recycling is the process to extract raw materials from used and transformed objects.</p>\n<p>The game is simple : You are presented with multiple objects and a sequence of actions to make in order to recycle them. You have 30 seconds to recycle as many object as you can.</p>\n<p>The game mechanics\u00a0are simple but allowed us to put into practice in a project what we learned about Unity. Any comments, suggestions &amp; remarks are appreciated !
