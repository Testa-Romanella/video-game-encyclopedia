When you click on an item, there's a bit of a description of what the item is. Then the next item or piece of text becomes available - but you have to find the items.</p>\n<p>The game was originally started as part of Global Game Jam 2019 (<em>What Home Means to You</em>), but wasn't finished on time. The idea was to convey to players my feelings about the objects you'd likely find in my room, as well as some objects I think I'd like to own but don't. This influenced the visual design of the game - the items are all hand-drawn by me, as well as the text being entirely in my handwriting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fact my handwriting is somewhat untidy at points represents the difficulty trying to get your point across to someone else. It might make sense to me why something is so important, while that same item might not elicit the same emotional response in somebody else - and that's fine.</p>\n<p>It's a very short game and I hope you enjoy it.<br/></p>\n<p>\u2764</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-11T03:38:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d842636b408270de111eceed6824ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Daniel Ilett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
