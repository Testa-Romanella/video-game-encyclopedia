I decided to complete it during the summer of 2019.</p>\n<p>Sick is... honestly very simple and not also not very pretty. It was an alright exemplar of my skill at pixel art at the beginning of its creation, but it isn't the best exemplar of my design philosophy. At the time it was more like a practice of sorts for me to do myself to get used to Construct 3 and game logic.</p>\n<p>The game is made in Construct 3, which I hadn't touched in about a year by the time I went back to actually finish the game. So it was weird getting used to a visual coding user interface after doing actual coding in Unity for the past year.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys: Movement</p>\n<p>X Key: Interaction</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/353e5dadcd7b2a1b4ce3586853ea1e87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peter Parker"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
