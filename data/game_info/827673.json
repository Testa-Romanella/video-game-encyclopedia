Together with Huraw, her loving mother, Dawani would weave colorful and beautiful cloths which they barter with the people in their village. Dawani\u2019s father died a week after her mother heard a raspy chirp from a cricket called \u201cKorokoy\u201d which in superstition, they believe brings death to a love one to anyone who hears it. Dawani heard the \u201cKorokoy\u201d just before a storm started. The storm ravaged their village for days. Determined to put an end to the devastating storm, Dawani decided to investigate by asking villagers about what they suspect is happening, that is where her adventure begins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T12:51:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e99/e99c7abc08d32065249c694a312ff3ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ADNU DACA Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
