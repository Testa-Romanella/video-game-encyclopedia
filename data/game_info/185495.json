I know it doesn\u2019t make much sense but it is basically a game in which your enemies are deaf but they try to detect you by looking around. They can even detect bullets. Your job is to sneak past them and kill whenever needed to reach the end. As I said this game is related to stealth so use that to your advantage and take them out 1 by 1 or else they will kill you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1f/e1fd811dd2ba193a4ecfbcb29972d51a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Musab1Blaser"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
