Using the last remaining resources available, a starship has been built, a very large ship named Ixion. Recall the story of Ixion the Greek hero who was tied to a fiery wheel spinning in the sky for eternity. The mission was tiresome, so many had been born on this ship never setting foot outside. Things were going smoothly despite the years of disrepair to much of the ship. And then it happened, a deadly pathogen spread through the ship and within 12 hours nearly everyone who had come in contact with it were dead, or worse\u2026<br/></p>\n\n<p>You are a simple psychologist living in the lowest economic class on the ship. When everything went wrong you stood up and began a journey to get to the bridge of the ship, hoping to find a way to survive this crisis. Along the way you discover many survivors, Will you be their Savior or will you be the last nail in the coffin for this expedition?</p>\n<p>This game was made within a time frame of 48 hours for the\u00a0#fargogamejam2017.
