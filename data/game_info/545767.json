Please stay tuned for future updates!</strong></p>\n<p>For more information on Baybayin, I recommend checking out this site for a basic overview and history of the writing system:\u00a0<br/>https://owlcation.com/humanities/Learn-how-to-type-write-and-read-baybayin</p>\n<p><em>As seen at imagineNATIVE 2019 in Toronto, Ontario!</em></p>\n<p><em>Check out my article on finding cultural connections from developing Tower of Baybayin in Maytaway Quarterly!</em></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>1/19/2021</p>\n<p>Wow, I'm finally\u00a0posting this game online! Despite having already premiered it at imagineNATIVE, I've been too afraid to actually upload it anywhere because it's not done. But after over a year of just sitting on it I realized that I can just....upload it anyways. So here it is!! I'm between jobs right now so I have time to continue development on ToB again, so hopefully I'll be able to upload a first update within the coming few weeks! In the meantime, please let me know any questions or feedback you have for Tower of Baybayin so that I may consider them for updates.
