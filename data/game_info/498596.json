Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.</p>\n\n<p>The game is arranged similar to Chinese checkers but without starting spaces and with a \"moat\" around the edge of the board. Players start with 14 marbles instead of 10, there are only two \"colors\", and the starting arrangement is different. But the game also uses a hexagon with marbles and 5 pits on each edge.</p>\n<p>Abalone was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4.5 million units. The year it was published it received one of the first Mensa Select awards in New York, New York. It is currently sold in more than thirty countries.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The aim of Abalone is to eject six of the opponent's marbles from the board. You can move up to three marbles of your color at one time, which must be connected in a straight line, in any direction, the destination fields are free or occupied by a minor number of opponent's marbles.</p>\n<p> <strong>Single Marble Move</strong></p>\n<p> Select the marble to move, than the location to move to.</p>\n<p> <strong>Multiple Marble Move</strong></p>\n<p> Select the first than last marble, then the location to move.</p>\n\n<p>Or if you just want to play the game online, visit Lazy Mutt Games online arcade:<br/>https://lazymuttgames.com/games/abalone/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Stop over and check us out at Lazy Mutt Games!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00c/00cd248b199ead3787a7fe9996b03d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lazy Mutt Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
