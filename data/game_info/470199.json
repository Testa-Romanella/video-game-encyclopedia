It is the first installment in Sony&#39;s Formula One series.</p>\n<p>Formula 1 is based on the 1995 Formula One World Championship. It is distinct from its sequels because it was made at the end of the season, meaning that it features driver substitutes. The game also allows two players to compete against each other either head-to-head or with other computer cars via the PlayStation Link Cable. Both players may then compete over a 17-race Championship season, or in a single race of the player&#39;s choice.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-19T09:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fe/6fe3e75973aaf7a9e4992081b8d86c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Bizarre Creations"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Psygnosis"], "esrb_rating": null}
