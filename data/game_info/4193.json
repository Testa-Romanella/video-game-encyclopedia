The goal of most missions is to capture and develop certain planets on the game map.<br />\nTo do so, you control your spacecraft fleet. Captured planets are not only strategically essential points and means to complete the mission, but they also produce Sollars \u2014 the primary currency in the game. You need Sollars for most of the actions that you can do in the game including upgrading your spaceships, planets, or even moving and dispatching your units. While conquering neutral planets is usually no hard task, you continuously encounter opposing forces (AI in single-player or other players in multiplayer) that also try to take over the planets and destroy your forces. The battles occur automatically, so the game\u2019s primary challenge is in proper management and your fleet arrangement. There are several races available in the game, each of which has unique properties. After the end of each match, the fraction you chose would gain points that can be exchanged for \u2018techs\u2019 which give you passive upgrades such fleet strength or decreased time to upgrade planets. There are also three difficulty settings, ranging from easy to hard.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:55:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/292/2926e2e90b4bdc4333b3c4ad79917d6c.jpg", "website": "http://www.planetsunderattack.com", "rating": 2.33, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 31, "owned": 1047, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 18, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 63, "ratings_count": 40, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 40, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "macOS"], "developers": ["Targem Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TopWare Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
