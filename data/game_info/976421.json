In a dystopian future where no one goes outside. Birth rate at an all time low, suicide rate at an all time high.<br/><br/>On the Rings of Atlantis, a ring of artificial islands built to withstand the rising sea level, a degenerate loner attempts to revive a stolen android. The attempt to jailbreak fails at first, until it didn't. To his surprise she wakes up. Playful, poetic, philosophical, and perhaps even a little possessive. <br/><br/>Beneath her charismatic demeanor she hides a dark secret. <br/><br/>Unravel the city together with her. <br/><br/>Nothing in the world compares to the real thing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The frequent sexual content disclaimer is just titillating stuff, there is no sex in here, so if you're here for tits and tits only, you might want to reconsider reading it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T07:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5c/c5c20f8ab47f45fa4fa42ac09313d806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Spectre Sun"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Spectre Sun"], "esrb_rating": null}
