The player must use his hands to squash hordes of bad guys trying to steal that energy for their own use, but watch out for the friendly birds that find scattered energy and return it to the altar where the energy is stored.<br/></p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\n<p>The player controls the left hand using the left stick and the right hand using the right stick. He can smash the ground using the coresponding triggers. Smashing enemies with the hands will eliminate them.<br/>The goal is to keep the energy alive for as long as possible by clearing waves of enemies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Oh, if you are wondering what that bar in the bottom left corner is for...</em></p>\n\n\r\nFeatures to come\r\n<ul><li>more enemy-types</li><li>power ups</li><li>more celebration-animations</li><li>and of course lots of other vague ideas</li></ul>\n\n\n\r\nSave that energy and destroy the bad guys!\r\n<p><em>Also let us know what you think and if you find any bugs.</em></p>\n\n<p>Enjoy,\u00a0Riki &amp; Bene</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f2/5f23164219367ae7aebed5a6a89bcf6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RikiKlein"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
