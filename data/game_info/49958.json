{"id": 49958, "slug": "defenders-of-tetsoidea-ii", "name": "Defenders of Tetsoidea II", "name_original": "Defenders of Tetsoidea II", "description": "A fun and emotional RPG about two classmates at a magic academy who get caught up in a dangerous struggle.  Choose from nine different classes for each of the four characters you get in your party. This is a short (approximately 2 hour) RPG that will hopefully satisfy any nostalgic itch you might have for this type of game. The game also features a tasteful selection of music and artwork. There are plenty of maps to explore and tough bosses to fight! Be warned though that there is some strange, slightly immature humor that you may appreciate.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77d/77d87942465c6de0152a7bc351f3090e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 111}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brewsterland Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brewsterland Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
