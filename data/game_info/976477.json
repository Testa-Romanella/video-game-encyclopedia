Initially, an example city scene is included in the game. Players can build their own city scenes by editing this example. The building blocks can be assembled by matching color-coded faces on the blocks. Waypoint gates (also a type of the given building blocks) should be included in a city scene, and these gates can be connected to form a closed loop. This loop is for fire copter drills just like racetracks are for car races. A drill is finished after the fire copter flies through all waypoint gates (three laps of the loop).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T12:11:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc9482e46aa000b1d1edd668071c77cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Steve Wu"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steve Wu"], "esrb_rating": null}
