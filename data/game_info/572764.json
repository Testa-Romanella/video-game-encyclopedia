It was designed to be played\r\n    with two joysticks (e.g. with a game controller). While it is <em>possible</em> to play with the\r\n    keyboard, doing so is fairly difficult and just not very fun.  Personally I use a \r\n    Logitech F310 (~$15).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    On MacOS you can use\r\n    Joystick Mapper\r\n    (or something similar) to map your game controller to keyboard keys.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    On Windows, you can use DS4Windows to\r\n    map a PS4 controller, or JoyToKey,\r\n    or REWASD for\r\n    other controller types.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    Vortex supports touch so you can technically run it on your phone, but that's\r\n    also not very fun. I've never met a touch joystick I liked, and this game's got <em>two</em> of\r\n    them. Mobile support primarily exists so that you can kick the tires or show the game to your\r\n    friends. But if you actually want to have a good time, grab a game controller and a PC.\r\n</p>\r\nProject\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n                Vortex was built using Flynn, an open-source\r\n                javascript/HTML5\r\n                game engine supporting desktop and moble browser game development.\r\n                <br/>\n<br/>\r\n                For more Flynn vector games see the project page at:\r\n                vectoralchemy.com\r\n                <br/>\n<br/>\r\n                Flynn capabilities demo\r\n            \r\n            \r\n                \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\nRelease party playlist\r\n<p>\r\n    We're still on COVID lockdown here so we're not filling our house with non-resident humans, but\r\n    we <em>are</em> eating way more pizza than the surgeon general would recommend while playing Vortex\r\n    on the big screen and blaring this\r\n    playlist.\r\n    Come join us in spirit.
