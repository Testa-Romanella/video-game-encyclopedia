It's a world of peace and pleasure, but noticeably (and thankfully) lacking in players farming them for experience and loot. At least it's supposed to be\u2026 the Mighty Rar, god of the digital afterlife, may have made a few mistakes recently that need some outside help to set everything back on track again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's up to the players *sigh* to enter this simulated afterlife to fight, craft, and farm across these floating islands Meet the denizens of this place and survive long enough to fix what Mighty Rar broke- *ahem* forgot to iterate upon.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all just makes you want to scream, \u201cGood Heavens!\u201d\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Heavens! is a tongue -and-cheek afterlife simulation, set in a god crafted world who just didn't know any better. To be honest, Xant-Rar is a mess, and really needs some Quality Assistance Testing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese idyllic islands might as well be deathmatch maps for all the NPCs \"enjoying\" their afterlife. Hedonistic dark metal elves, hippie demons, capitalist werewolves, devoutly religious zombies, all are at each other's throats.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch your step - the islands float. If you don't pay attention, you may run afoul of a foul-mouthed valley or a pointy stick with an attitude that a careless NPC \"left behind\".\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBugfixing Mighty Rar's creation requires skills. Employ a dynamic class system, mixing and matching abilities to create just the right character for any playstyle. Crafter? Explorer? Trader? Jack-of-all-trades? If this is heaven, there has to be options!\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSolve dozens of quests, bringing peace to the suspended terrain and levitating cities up from the rubble, showing NPCs how it's done (again) ((sorry)).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSolo the game for bragging rights... Or collaborate with other players to salvage Rar's creations in XX person multiplayer!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe afterlife is home to more than just clueless NPCs however. Rar might have inadvertently created a home for something, much worse in-between these lines of code...\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, worse than the farting cauldrons, swords that talk back, and invisibility pantaloons.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil that mystery is uncovered, Mighty Rar just needs you to get going, like right now. What are you waiting for?
