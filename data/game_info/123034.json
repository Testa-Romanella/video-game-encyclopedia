If any one has any questions about the code, just message me and I'll be more than happy to explain it :)</p><p>Adjusting the difficulty simply changes the game speed, easier being slower, and harder being faster (the game look nicer when it's faster)</p><p>\"WASD to move, Space to use shield (last about 3 seconds, only absorbs bullets, running into enemies still does damage.)
