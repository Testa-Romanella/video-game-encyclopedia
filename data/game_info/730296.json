The villagers are required to open the final exit and leave or to vote out the killer. While the killer's task is to kill the villager until there's an equal number of villager and killer. The controls are WASD or up, down, left, right arrow for movement, space can be used to jump. R is to kill or to investigate. If you are the killer or investigator, when the game starts an icon on the top right would be displayed. When the investigator investigates it will only display the amount the kills a person has, not if they're killer or not. The rest you'll need to find out yourself, but the game is mainly like Among us with a little twist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T07:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b1/0b1b156944e0b72afe2732e47a011326.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Unhelpfulbot"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
