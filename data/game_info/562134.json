Will you seal the great evil living within the...uh...laundromat...OR will the demons take over all of Earth as we know it?!</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a demon hiding inside the washing machines, making them hacked. There are also\u00a0people using the washing machines. If a person uses a hacked washed machine, they will become <em>possessed</em>.<br/>After a person becomes possessed, they can go and hack other washing machines, thus making the power of the demon stronger and causing more people to become possessed.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>You can fix a hacked washing machine by fixing it\u2019s cable circuit on the back. You can do so by walking up to a washing machine that you think is hacked and interacting with it.<br/></p>\n<p>You can also exorcise people who are possessed. In order to do so, you will need to talk to people and determine by the conversation whether or not they are possessed. If you think that they are possessed, you can threaten them to bring the demon out of them. However,\u00a0if you do that to a person who is not possessed, the demon will hack another washing machine.</p>\n<p>Victory is achieved by successfully fixing all hacked washing machines and exorcising all possessed people.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Movement: WASD / Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>\u2022 Interact/Talk: E</p>\n<p>\u2022 Select Option: Left-click</p>\n<p>\u2022 Rotate Washing Machine Tile: Left-click</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Lynn Boass: Writer, UI Designer, and Pixel Artist</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://lynnboass.itch.io/</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://twitter.com/LynnBoass</p>\n<p>\u2022 Dukebot: Programmer and Level Designer</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://dukebot.itch.io/</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://twitter.com/DukebotDev</p>\n<p>\u2022 Missingfox: Composer, Sound Designer, Pixel Artist, and Level Designer</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://missingfox.itch.io/</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://twitter.com/MissingFox1</p>\n<p>\u2022 Kagenashi: Programmer, UI Designer, and Level Designer</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0https://kagenashi.itch.io/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8f/e8ff6082cc9c26306a9f8c2556f43239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dukebot", "LynnBoass", "missingfox", "kagenashi"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
