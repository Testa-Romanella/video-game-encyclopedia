Each level is a simple arena filled with skeletons trying to kill the player. Some of which have features - they throw grenades, chains on impact, teleport, etc. After each level, the player's character becomes stronger - by purchasing modifications in the store or gets them as a reward for completing a level. Modifications can improve range weapons (each type has its own set), active abilities, melee weapon, and the player's character himself. The game features 4 range weapons types: a firearm, explosives, ice laser and a flamethrower - two of which the player will choose for run (left and right mouse buttons).
