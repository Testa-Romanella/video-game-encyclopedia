This is my first official game so I'd appreciate it if some people gave it a shot. Soopy is an extremely small game with an average play time of about 30 minutes, so if you have a spare half an hour then you should probably give this game a try, I'm happy to receive your feedback.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Disclaimer : When playing this you will likely be either really disappointed or somewhat surprised with this game, so all I ask is that when playing my game, please play it with an open mind and knowledge that this\u00a0is my first official game. Thank you and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:27:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eba5e8bb039f796ced89c9ced8b8811.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kumo Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
