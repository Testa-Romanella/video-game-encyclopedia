{"id": 374521, "slug": "gene-century-wind-tower", "name": "Gene Century: Wind Tower", "name_original": "Gene Century: Wind Tower", "description": "\"Gene Century - Wind Tower\" is a india game of TPS developed from China.<br/><br/>The game art style was used \u2018Heavy industry\u2019 style, the scene is switched in 4 different styles; character animation in the game is all realized by motion capture technology, the gun system uses the Real-firearm setting, which includes 10 different weapons and 9 upgrade modules. Two rare weapons need to be obtained through the reward mission.<br/><br/>Game sandbox mode runs through the whole game. In the two worlds of 'real world' and 'mechanical world', you can freely upgrade armor and make armor with the picked items. Upgrade the main weapon and the machine gun tower; the game's compact plot flow and sandbox weapon system will allow you to immerse yourself in the game.<br/><br/>Game Highlights:<br/><br/>1: compact and orderly game flow<br/>From entering the game, each level has been carefully designed by us. As the story unfolds, the 'world level' will gradually increase, you need to upgrade the guns, armor &amp; challenge reward levels to cope with more and more powerful enemies. the game uses a 'compact process' design, during the game, you can feel the game process is compact Order without any delay.<br/><br/>2:  hardcore game with hardcore enemy<br/>A single-player shooting game, how to design the enemy is the key to success or failure.<br/><br/>The enemy system of this game is extended on the three structures of patrol, monitoring and reaction, and develops 'Personality' and 'Tactical' systems.<br/><br/>Personality: Different levels of enemies have different character characteristics in combat. For example, when two soldiers are in the team, when you kill another one nearby, they will be scared away, while the elite arms will not; the 'captain' level has active attack. <br/><br/>Tactics: Enemies in the game will calculate the attack behavior based on the bunkers you are hiding. Hiding in different bunkers will directly affect the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>3: character control and motion capture<br/>In order to provide a smooth operation feel, we have added 6 sets of motion capture files for the character system to build, no matter squat, standing, shooting, bunkers interaction is very smooth.<br/><br/>4: true color original painting level display<br/>We re-architected the engine color algorithm to get 20% more color space in the game than the traditional mode.<br/><br/>5: sandbox system and world level<br/>Sandbox mode runs through the game.

The source of the war came from the technology wizard Bill Feynman. The secret algorithm he developed allowed the quantum technology era to come ahead. With the doubling of computer power, the human gene chain is no longer a secret.<br/><br/>Bill Feynman hopes to merge the gap between mechanical life and humans by changing the combination of genes; so he released the gene atomizer...<br/><br/>The atomizing agent is fused in the clouds, and the world has started with 'gene rain'. With the spread of genetic rain, the world is chaotic. Not everyone can accept genetic changes. Human beings die in large numbers, and mechanical civilization begins to control the world.<br/><br/>The human resistance army was established over time! They launched a war against mechanical creatures.<br/><br/>The continuation of the war led to the death of 2 billion people in the world (1.5 billion humans, 500 million mechanical lives), Simultaneously mechanical civilization is completely opposed to human civilization.<br/><br/>This kind of gene atomizing agent is transmitted through the wind tower network, and the human death and injury are increasing. However, The magnetic field in the wind tower area causes human life to be inaccessible.<br/><br/>After years of research and development by the Rebel Army, the armor capable of resisting the magnetic field has finally been completed. Due to the special materials used, the Rebel Army Only 7 sets of armor can be made. <br/>In the game, you will play the hero of the rebel army, put on the armor and enter the wind tower area, and embark on an unknown and difficult journey.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T02:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/212/21283e8329a567311d7832b5f211b26c.jpg", "website": "http://www.genecentury.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 589, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u72f8\u82b1\u732b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Deeli network"], "esrb_rating": null}
