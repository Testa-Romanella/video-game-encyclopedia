It is A Bakers Dozen! And it was finally made for the Yandere Jam :D</p>\n<p>Within the game your character to play has just moved from their home a few states over to complete their college at a place that had the best reputation for their programs and student college life. Though, they didn\u2019t mind that stuff too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After getting a great deal on an upper apartment close to their school from their Aunts friend, they were set and ready to finish their education.</p>\n<p>But every week someone tries to push them and every week they try to stay sane! How does this keep happening?? What is the common denominator??? Who will win, Gabriel\u2019s sanity or whichever Yandere that they accidentally picked up this week?????????</p>\n<p>WARNINGS; This game includes \u201cYandere\u201d content that includes but is not limited to, mentions of stalking, violence, and murder.</p>\n<p>///I am most definitely a new dev if you couldn\u2019t already guess so I apologize if anything in-game within my control is absolutely insufferable.
