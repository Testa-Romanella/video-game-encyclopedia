Travel through various procedurally generated lands, battle challenging enemies, and collect diverse resources to expand your city and unlock new weapons. Avoid lava and carve your own path to the top as everything is destructible.<br/><br/><br/>During your adventure, you will come across various lands. In each of them, you will find rare minerals. The farther you go, the rarer the minerals will be, but be careful, the rarer the minerals, the more dangerous the monsters become and their strength significantly increases.<br/><br/><br/>Expand your city to become a home for an even greater number of NPCs. Developing your city becomes more demanding over time, but it grants access to new quests, lands, weapons, items, and generally gives you greater prestige and a sense of fulfillment in life.<br/><br/><br/>A world full of magnificent treasures, dangerous monsters, beautiful lands, and a rich history embedded in a platformer roguelite action game is waiting for you to immerse yourself in it.
