It involved approx. 10 teams, each comprised of 3-5 members, creating a game from scratch during a weekend.</p>\n<p>Our game pits 2 players against each other in a deathmatch of sorts where the way to defeat your opponent is to kill your own robot before they can do the same to themselves. To accomplish this, the game spawns random traps in the levels that must be triggered using the appropriate switch. One other way to win is to get jumped on 2 times in quick succession by the other player. The first player to get to 5 suicides wins.</p>\n<p>Due to the time constraints, we didn't really get a chance to exploit our map generator and the game mechanics are in a pretty buggy state, though we feel that with a little polish, the core idea has some potential.<br/></p>\n<p>Created with Unity, download contains a ready-made executable build. Requires 64-bit system, built for Windows.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Player 1 <br/>Move left:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A<br/>Move right: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 D<br/>Jump:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 W<br/>Drop:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 S<br/>Activate trap:\u00a0 \u00a0Left Ctrl</p>\n<p>Player 2 <br/></p>\n<p>Move left:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 J<br/>Move right: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 L<br/>Jump:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I<br/>Drop:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 K<br/>Activate trap:\u00a0\u00a0 Right Ctrl</p>\n\n\n<p>Programmers: Andres Salminen, Riku Syk\u00e4ri, Teemu Saarinen<br/>Artist: P\u00e4ivi Lindell</p>\n<p>Music from Jukedeck - create your own at http://jukedeck.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d10848545d72f23fe803eb0b4e65a61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rsykari"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
