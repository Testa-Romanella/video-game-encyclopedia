You have a squad of 3 members but you can only posses\u00a0<strong>ONE</strong>\u00a0member per\u00a0<strong>Turn.\u00a0</strong>Based on what you do that turn, your next turn will come slower or faster.</p>\n<p>Moreover, possessing a body will inflict\u00a0<strong>Strain</strong> upon the host. The higher the strain on host, the slower your next turn comes, and the more damage you take. Since you are able to make only one choice per turn, you need to make it count.</p>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>The icons for every character were taken from here :\u00a0http://www.akashics.moe/</p><p>The FX animations were taken from theSuperpowers RPG Battle System Asset Pack :https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/superpowers</p>\n<p>Everything else was done by me.</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0\u00a0The webgl build was NOT verified.
