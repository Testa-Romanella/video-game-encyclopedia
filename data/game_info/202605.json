Enough difficulty to create a lot of frustration and scores that depend on your ability to finish off the blocks as quickly as you can. Also, a small high score list, so that you can show everyone how amazing you are at this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39c/39cbe9a1c1f430aa9c30b88920d496e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["George Pagkalis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
