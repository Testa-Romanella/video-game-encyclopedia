There's a day night cycle and each day lasts 8 minutes and it's enough to see everything.</p>\n<p>My biggest inspiration for this game was Mediterranean Voidland\u00a0and also this article\u00a0http://reallifemag.com/a-warm-place/</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Art and code by Fi Silva. You can follow me on twitter @fifsilva</p>\n<p>Music and atmospheric sounds by Paws Menu. Also on twitter @thesaveroom</p>\n<p>(also thanks for being my mac tester, for all the feedback and for the abstract painting)</p>\n<p>Other sounds:</p>\n<p>Rustle grass by freesound userJanKoehl</p>\n<p>Walking on water by freesound user Robinhood76</p>\n<p>Special thanks to all my friends and people from twitter who tested it. Especially the friends who don't like games where you don't do anything but were nice anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard/Mouse controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD to walk</li><li>Mouse to control camera</li><li>Left Click / E to interact</li><li>Right Click / T to use telescope (when you have it)</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>O to take screenshot</li><li>P / Esc to pause</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controller controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left joystick to walk</li><li>Right joystick to control camera</li><li>A to interact</li><li>B to use telescope</li><li>Y to jump</li><li>X to take screenshot</li><li>Start to pause</li></ul>\n<p>It works with Xbox controller on windows, and should work on mac as well. I haven't added support to other controllers for now, because I really wanted to release this. I'll make a new build if I learn and integrate an asset for that. For now you can play with mouse and keyboard or change the input mapping in the config screen.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the trouble.</p><p><strong>Selected press:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/02/a-bright-light-in-the-middle-of-the-...</p>\n<p>https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/ne73nk/explore-a-gorgeous-lighthouse-hau...</p>\n<p>http://entertainium.org/articles/a-bright-light-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean-is-a-...\r\n</p>\n<p>http://www.gamereport.es/a-bright-light-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean/</p>\n\n<p>Just a note:\u00a0There are 11 drawings + 2 paintings (including the one that is not mine) + 1 book with illustrations.\u00a0There are 6 titled books (+ the encyclopedia of birds)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c71d60e2c9e39c67ee3011aacd535a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fi Silva"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
