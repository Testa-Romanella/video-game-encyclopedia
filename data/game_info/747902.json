Maybe your daydreaming includes destroying your tasks and collecting a precious material! Or maybe your daydreams aren't very creative. I can relate. That's why The Daydream Pits has you fighting slimes and collecting coins. While you are playing, maybe consider daydreaming that you are playing something even more fun! Maybe instead of collecting coins or collecting a paycheck, you're actually hunting for some mystical artifact! Maybe instead of killing slimes as a metaphor for completing tasks, you are actually fighting deadly dragons!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The possibilities of your imagination are endless! Unlike the possibilities in The Daydream Pits which are pretty much what I just described above.\u00a0But that's okay, none of it is real. The words you are reading aren't real either, they are just pixels arranged in a fancy way by the lightning contained within the metal rectangle you are staring at.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam Info:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made for the Brackey's Game Jam 2022.1.
