But I kind of like the idea so I'm uploading this <strong>prototype </strong>anyway.<br/></p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf51 Pitch</p>\n<p>The game should be a <strong>Party Turn Based Strategy/RPG</strong> where you control a group of Great old ones and Outer gods to destroy humanity (and possibly the universe). You can create new horrors and make them evolve by subjugating humans. The upgrades will make your horrors more powerful and each will give it new visual features to make each monster unique.</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udfae Controls</p>\n<p>In this prototype you have 3 horrors and you can freely upgrade them with some abilities/parts. There's also some example enemies and abilities for them, but no actual gameplay is implemented. Just <strong>click </strong>on the units and on the horrible interface on the right (and scroll with the mouse wheel)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T08:39:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d80c60bbe7cbe0cd2a4f441e93040d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sirdorius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
