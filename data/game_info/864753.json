The idea came when I was throwing a round, green\u00a0plush toy\u00a0in the air and trying to catch it, I\u00a0thought it might be a fun game, so I\u00a0threw this together. The source-code can be found at\u00a0https://github.com/LouisDevelopment/SquishyTechDemo</p>\n<p>The game will be focused on \"Squishy\", a virtual pet who likes to be thrown around and played with.\u00a0You will be able to feed him, take him on walks, play fetch with him and enter him into tournaments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features of this tech-demo include \"Squishy\" the simple soft-body virtual pet, and balls that can be added to the scene to be played with. Squishy uses the first iteration of my soft-body engine. I'm sure there will be changes to be made, but as it is currently, it works well enough.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T11:02:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5c723ecc462aa0972b2a08d231ecc15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Louis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
