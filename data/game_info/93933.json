You are a chef, a serious, super serious chef. Your job is to create the most delicious dishes, with the most finest, and these ingredients just\u00a0happen to be cute and sentient.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>After you start the game you will be tasked with gathering ingredients that need to be prepped a specific way. For example, if you are tasked with getting 3 whipped eggs you need to grab the whisk from the kitchen, head to the fridge area, and attack some egg guys. You need to optimize your route to complete each order on time for your guests!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can be asked to whip an enemy (use the whisk), fry an enemy (use the pan), scoop the enemy (use the scoop), or chop the enemy (use the knife). At the end of the order you need to return to the counter and interact to deliver your meal.</p>\n<p>(If you are experiencing lag or sensitivity issues\u00a0download the windows build!
