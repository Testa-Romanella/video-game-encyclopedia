The game is currently in development for both the PlayStation 2 and PC and will feature single race and time trial modes in addition to a\u00a0<em>Cannonball Run</em>-style championship mode in which players must outrun police forces in cities all over the world.\r\n</p>\n<p>\"London Racer: World Challenge is the biggest race we have ever made,\" said Hans Lange, sales and marketing director of Davilex Games. \"It contains 76 separate tracks, 16 world-famous cities, and you can choose out of no less than 23 different cars. We have gone the extra mile to give the gamer true value for money with this title.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>In addition to racing on the streets of London, players will get to go up against local law enforcement officers in Paris, Berlin, New York, and Los Angeles, to name but a few of the game's 16 locales. The game will feature a competitive two-player mode, but further gameplay information is scarce at present.
