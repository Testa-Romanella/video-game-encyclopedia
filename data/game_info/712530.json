On this island, the eight elements and its civilians live in peace... however it was not always that way. After the big responsibility of guarding the elemental entities- the Jima Orbs- was trusted to the wrong duo, our titular Hachi, an octopus, and Hachi, a bee,\u00a0\u00a0they must right their wrongs and set out for the Jima Orbs! Along their way they must also hunt for the bricks of the shrine the orbs once called their home, and calm the distressed squeals- the constantly screaming seals! Enjoy this 3D platformer-collectathon demo that was worked on rigorously all of the Fall 2021 semester by the students in Webster University's Video Game Production (GAME 4600) class!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<p>Madeleine Beiter</p>\n<p>Thomas Kinney</p>\n<p>Kari Jordan</p>\n<p>Rebekah Myers</p>\n\n<p>Programming:</p>\n<p>Jackson Wright</p>\n<p>Rebekah Myers</p>\n<p>Matthew Burton</p>\n<p>Justin Macanufo</p>\n<p>Justin Baldridge</p>\n\n<p>Narrative:</p>\n<p>G Novak</p>\n<p>William Legens</p>\n\n<p>Sound:</p>\n<p>Orion Allman</p>\n<p>Ethan Cargill</p>\n<p>Kari Jordan</p>\n\n<p>Producers:</p>\n<p>William Legens</p>\n<p>Matthew Burton</p>\n<p>Justin Macanufo</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys</p>\n<p>Camera: Mouse Movement</p>\n<p>Jump: Spacebar</p>\n<p>Talk: E</p>\n<p>Melee Attack: Left Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Ranged Attack: Right Mouse Click</p>\n<p>Swap to Sky Mode (On Land) / Land Mode (In Sky): V key</p>\n<p>Switch Ammo Types (On Land): Mouse Wheel</p>\n<p>Tentaspring (Land Only): Hold Left Control on ground for 2 seconds then press Space</p>\n<p>Sprint: Double-Tap W</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T10:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0de/0decd4c1f5759ecc43b814d3c999c45d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Webster Game Design"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
