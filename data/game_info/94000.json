Each vehicle handles slightly different with tweaks to acceleration, top speed, slipperiness, gripperiness, handling and steering. Despite these differences, I\u00a0put in some effort to balance each vehicle until it comes down to driving style and preference for your choice.\u00a0This is all being perfected, still, and if you have\u00a0<em>any</em> feedback on any of the vehicles, it's totally welcome!<br/>- A brutal, visceral experience driving the cars. Even though you're merely using left and right to steer, it's an exciting experience that takes the essentials of a racing game and boils them down until they can be crammed onto a mobile device. The physics of this game reward a good racing line and absolutely punish you for a bad line. If you're any good at racing sims, that actually translates decently well to this game, despite the\u00a0<em>super</em> simplified driving.<br/>- A practice map with simple corner types and plenty of run-off area to learn the handling of the cars and get comfortable driving. Remember:\u00a0concentrate on your line! Enter wide, hit the apex inside, exit wide.<br/>-\u00a0Three challenging stages, each with its own boss and learning curve.</p>\n<p>What's the final game intended to be like?<br/>A single-player campaign of 6+1 touge stages, with a practice mode to memorize each stage and cut down your lap times until you feel confident enough to choose battle mode - and challenge the ghost haunting that stage. Win, and the stage is clear. Lose, and your soul is doomed to race the mountain passes for eternity.<br/></p>\n<p>The title is bound to change. Not sure to what. But it's not final.</p>\n<p>Feel free to download, buy me a coffee with the donation if you're really compelled, but it's by no means necessary.\u00a0Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b750c1947a6c055b0ba9ccde18ed6d7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BRAINOS"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
