Thus I recently decided to create a remake.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The remake differs from the original in two points: \r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>There is no \u201ehard-core\u201c mode (yet). In this mode the key layout was randomized and displayed when a new game was started. \r\n  </li><li>The game was (and still is) randomized, but in the remake you can enter a seed to replay the same level.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>Press W and S to activate the up and down shield, left and right arrow key to activate left and right shield.</p>\n<ul><li>Use the shields (yellow = down, blue = up) to avoid damage by spaceships\r\n  </li><li>If any spaceship touches lowered shields, you will lose health (red top bar)\r\n  </li><li>If a life pots touches lowered shields, you will regenerate health (red top bar)\r\n  </li><li>Shields will fail, when the shield energy\u00a0 is used up\u00a0(blue top bar)</li><li>Keep shields down to regenerate shield energy (blue top bar)\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Further development:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Currently there are no plans to improve the game, but nothing is set in stone \u2026 :)\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e01/e01e75aee51f89b5f2fa0c731ea96f29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["tom.io"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
