He's a slime.<br/><br/>Jerry loves jumping, however, when he becomes a warrior, he can't jump anymore, so he\u00a0turns into violence, being able to destroy whatever he wants, or rewind to his previous state and place. Even though he only wants to destroy some weird cracked doors...<br/><br/>Anyway, Jerry seems to be in some weird place. Who knows how he got there, Jerry always gets in trouble somehow. He has to make use of his abilities to solve some puzzles and get out of wherever he is now.<br/><br/>This game was made by alditto (Me) and MickyOr (https://itch.io/profile/mickyor),\u00a0for the Brackeys Jam 2020.2.
