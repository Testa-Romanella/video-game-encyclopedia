And you're not a normal barista either, huh?\u00a0</p>\n<p>They normally don't hire cats as baristas, and its especially surprising given how much the manager hates cats! Unlike a normal Starbucks, you're going to have to go to the customers to get their orders, then go back to the bar to collect the needed ingredients and deliver their drink. Be careful not to run into the wrong customer on the way back, or you will spill your drink, and have to redo all your hard work. Also, make sure not to take to long, or the customer will get angry and leave. If you don't serve enough customers in a day, the manager won't be happy with you, and if the manager catches you in your true cat form, I suspect that will be an instant firing. So be sure to use your cat form to avoid spilling, but use your human form when the manager is around! Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Controls (Left click to enable in-game mouse controls, escape to regain cursor):\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouse movement - Camera rotation\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left click - Interact (Grab ingredients, Take order, Deliver orders)</p>\n<p>Right click - Transform between cat and human forms</p>\n<p>Space bar (as cat) -  Pump balloon, gaining vertical velocity, and also fly in other directions if holding WASD.
