Iron Warfare Theatre Assault is a semi-realistic tank game that gives the player an opportunity to control a semi-realistic tank controller rather than focusing on an arcade battle. The uniqueness of this game is how the player is able to control a large number of tanks, that will be available in future updates. Featuring various missions and a storyline that is created from the historical pages of WWII &amp; the Cold War, you will be fighting alongside your allies to experience the tank battles once again.<br/><br/>*Iron Warfare: Theatre Assault does not require an Internet connection, you can play offline.<br/><br/>This game project is created by a small Burmese Indie Games Developer Team - so if you're a local, make sure to support us.<br/><br/>Follow Us:<br/>Join our communities on Facebook.
