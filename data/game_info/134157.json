You'd totally be up to the challenge of kicking them out, but...well, you spent a bit too much money on Monolith Burgers so you could only afford an old, second-hand space suit that's so clunky, you can't jump in it. But luckily you're in space where gravity is a fickle thing, prone to change at the flick of a wrist!</p><p>Change the gravity and land on top of the enemies to destroy them. Land on several in a row without touching the ground (or ceiling, I guess) to start a combo and get more points! Rack up a high score and become the best space thingies destroyer space person!
