Touch and drag anywhere on the screen to aim, double tap to bomb and kill all enemies on screen!<br/></p><p>Powerups will either give you a better shot type (or extend the duration of your current powerup) or give you an extra bomb, up to a maximum of 3. You can also just let them fall to the planet to regrow its health!</p><p>Tap on the tiny planet to pause the game. The World!</p><p>Due to severe and unexpected restraints in the free version of Construct 2, the software I'm using, the game ended up being a lot more simple than I had planned, so for now it's just an arcade-ish thing. Go for a personal highscore!!</p><p>While I did much better than in my last jam, I am still not satisfied with the result thanks to Construct 2's constraints on free users, so I'm honestly not expecting much here. If, though, there's enough nice feedback (I mean I don't expect anyone to be excited for a \"full\" version of an arcade shooter) I might get hyped enough to migrate it to Game Maker or somewhere else and actually make it a bigger game.</p><p>Anyways, hope you get a few minutes of fun out of this! See you in the next jam!?</p><p>Man I wish I could make music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb267fbb7188e789685cfb7f52dde27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GaoGaoTaiga"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
