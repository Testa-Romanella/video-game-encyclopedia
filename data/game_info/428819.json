He said it didn\u2019t make much sense to him, but I don\u2019t know what his expectations were. You know what this kind of trip can be like for some people. <br/><br/>Anyway, it\u2019s supposed to be varied, a few locations, a nice hotel and not too crowded. I think there\u2019s even some wildlife. I should return it to the company, but if you\u2019re just looking to get away for a bit, I can give you a good discount. That would save me the effort of sending it in. Obviously, there are no guarantees as I haven\u2019t tested it myself.<br/><br/>So, you\u2019d be on your own with it. You\u2019re ok with that right?<br/><br/>_________________________<br/><br/>Defective Holiday is single player, first person, lightly interactive will take about an hour to complete. As you play, you\u2019re pulled between different scenes \u2013 a beach, departure lounge, restaurant, taxi and more - present in each location for only a fleeting moment before being moved on to the next. <br/><br/>Featuring original music by Mechatok", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T06:00:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0dd/0dd05b3e2ca002a057a4c368ad4ab005.jpg", "website": "http://defective.holiday", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kim Laughton"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Kim Laughton"], "esrb_rating": null}
