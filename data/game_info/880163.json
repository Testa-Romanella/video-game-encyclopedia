In the game this is a core-mechanic.</p>\n<p>Save the world is a puzzle-platformer with saving and restoring the the world using Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Z at it's core. The Ctrl-S binding is messy in the browser, but since it's is core to the theme of the game jam it stays.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Johannes Perdahl - Sound Design, Composer</p>\n<p>Anna Dunker - Level Design, Art Direction</p>\n<p>Roy Sanderson - Programming<br/></p>\n<p>Gustav Englund - Programming</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T08:23:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6eb5d8c5b11604458cc654758c2e4d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Herjeman"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
