This game was made in <strong>3 hours and 6 minutes</strong>. This was a really fun game to make, and I\u00a0loved participating in the game jam and the challenge! This is my second solo game jam that I have participated in, and my first game using Construct 3! I\u00a0feel like this game has improved significantly in comparison to The Life of Bob from my last solo game jam! I will definitely be using Construct 3 more often! Game Maker Studio 2 is a great engine, but even though I know a tiny bit of coding, it still relies a bit too much on having a stable knowledge of how to code games for my personal preference, for now at least. If you want to check out The Life of Bob to see the differences between the two games, here you go!</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://very-tori.itch.io/the-life-of-bob</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0have the right to use all of the assets in this game. Bob, his animation, the orange ball, and 99% of the song were made prior to the game jam, but I 100% own them and made it myself. I found the sound effects on https://opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T04:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e1/3e1922d0a84f3d5b26735ec32af502be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VeryTori"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
