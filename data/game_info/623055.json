Set in Sheffield\u2019s<em> only</em> time-travelling nightclub, you are invited to travel back through time and experience a number of different historical eras each with a link to Sheffield's colourful history. Take a nostalgic trip to 1980s Park Hill Flats, witness the beautiful love story of Frank and Joy, inspired by artwork of Pete McKee and journey through some of Sheffield\u2019s most haunted locations.\r\n</p>\n<p>TimeCrashers\u2019 has been developed and created as part of Chol\u2019s Tall Shadow\u2019s Programme. A year long project using co-creation to produce a number of new artworks. The creative team of TimeCrashers was made up of young people working alongside industry professionals to produce this \u2018one of a kind\u2019 event.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The process began with a number of creative sessions where Chol\u2019s core team met with the Tall Shadows Young Producer Interns, emerging young artists and experienced professionals to imagine a final \u2018show stopping\u2019 event to complete the year long programme . Starting from scratch the group explored a number of themes, ideas and outcomes before deciding on the final time traveling\u00a0 theme. Each member of the creative team worked as \u2018Equal Players\u2019 to develop the idea, create the narrative and decide on the final product. Each section has been carefully crafted by small working groups of film makers, performers, producers and directors before being pulled together to create the final event.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The script and story was first developed into an online immersive performance before being reworked into the final gaming experience with expertise and support from NMV and Digital Game Artist Lex Roberts. The live performance event received glowing feedback from audience members, being described as \u2018innovative,\u2019 \u2018thoughtful\u2019 and \u2018educational\u2019. The team are looking forward to finding out how audiences will receive the reworked interactive game. Creative Director Lauren Ash said, \u2018I am immensely proud of the achievements of this talented group of individuals. Each and every one of them has worked extremely hard to turn our fantastical idea into a reality. We started with huge ambitions and I am happy to say we created a product that is truly one of a kind.\u2019</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T06:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d7a/d7aed452a75cb0bba34d7628dc3792c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CholTheatre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
