{"id": 509044, "slug": "the-dome-itch", "name": "The Dome (itch)", "name_original": "The Dome (itch)", "description": "<p>This project is inspired by the game Fallout New Vegas and The Simpson\u2019s Movie. It is about the story of a man who is a bodyguard for one of the wealthiest people in this post-apocalyptic city that is closed off the rest of the world by a wall and an indestructible roof that is transparent. This world takes place in the year 2223, and there are different factions trying to take control of the city, The Reclaimers, the military, and the Malachite Brotherhood. The city has been prosperous for years, but recently tension between the factions and the government has escalated; but talks of peace are going around in hope of bringing back harmony to the Dome.\u00a0<br/>The character is thrown into making decisions after his brother and boss are killed in an attack by the Malachite Brotherhood. Marcus Phoenix is the protagonist\u2019s name, and he has an army of robots that he is in control of because his boss trusted him with his life. After the attack he can decide to join any of the factions or eliminate all of them and take control of the city himself. Every ending is different and only one ending is a positive or \u201chappy\u201d ending. There is no right or wrong choice, but I wanted to make only one or two choices a positive ending, the rest I wanted to show that human nature is chaotic, so eventually it ends in chaos or sadness.<br/>In this project I hope to make people question their decision and rationalize who has the best interest in mind for the sake of humanity. It is not perfect, but it is my first game, so I am proud I tried something new and out of my comfort zone.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T04:20:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54e4544c721b37109580ef6acf4cd6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Manuelandree2010"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
