There are three game modes and their goals are<br/>different:</p>\n<p>- Battle: Touch your ninja star to the opponent's heart to kill them. *</p>\n<p>- Survival: Dodge different types of ninja stars as long as you can. After you die<br/>you will be fast-forwarded to a slightly easier difficulty than the one you<br/>experienced getting your highest score.</p>\n<p>- Hunt: Touch as many hearts as you can before time runs out. Each touch the<br/>timer will reset, but be a little less lenient. Score increases based on how quickly<br/>you touch each heart.</p>\n<p> There are three game variants:</p>\n<p>- No Switching</p>\n<p>- Switch Positions: You can press a button to instantly swap positions of the<br/>heart and star.</p>\n<p>- Switch Control: You own two pairs of heart and stars and you can switch the<br/>current heart and star you are controlling independently. A heart or a star not<br/>being controlled will continue moving in its previous speed and direction. **</p>\n<p> Controls:</p>\n<p>- Keyboard: Use WASD to control the heart and the arrow keys for the star.<br/>Switching is controlled by the Control, Shift, or Alt keys. During gameplay the<br/>Escape key pauses the game.</p>\n<p>- Gamepad: Use the left joystick to control the heart and the right joystick for the<br/>star. Switching is controlled by the triggers or shoulder buttons. During gameplay<br/>the center buttons pause the game.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>- To Battle a human player your must have at least one gamepad. Two gamepads is suggested.</p>\n<p>* Online multiplayer will be added soon as an option in Battle.<br/>** Switch Control versus AI will be added soon as an option in Battle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:08:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d01b8c9fd1faacad856221508670cab6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dawnbreaker Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
