In a medieval kingdom, you must scout out resources and hazards to decide where to  build your mightiest castles. Commit too soon and you might discover a tribe of ogres right next door, but commit too late, and your opponents will grab up all the real estate!<br/><br/>Six different opponents, each with their own personality, challenge you at a variety of difficulty levels to make the game very replayable.<br/><br/>Kingdoms is built on the same successful MobileEuroCard platform that was used to create Reiner Knizia&amp;#39;s High Society and Reiner Knizia&amp;#39;s Money. Simple gestures allow you to grab and move tiles. Everything is animated, for a colorful play experience.<br/><br/>This newest version uses Game Center for leaderboards and achievements. We plan multiplayer play for a future release.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a369b057d7552b4a8f515e5a409012b.jpeg", "website": "http://www.skotos.net/games/strategy-board.php", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Skotos Tech"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Card"], "publishers": ["Skotos Tech"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
