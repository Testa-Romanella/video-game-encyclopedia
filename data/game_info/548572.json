Each of it has a variety of scenes, in each scene you have a new perception and experience of the place. Everey room altought has its own main characteristic.</p>\n<p>The tunnel is mainly a visual experience in which the views get shifted/distorted/mirrored.</p>\n<p>The bar is an auditive experience which through its scenes evolves from a bar, which has similarities to one in the real world, to a virtual space which produces music by walking through triggers.</p>\n<p>The third \"room\" is the state of mind. This place has a different appearance in each scene. In each of them you will somehow be taken out of place by confusion, sound and visual experience. It should represent your subconscious and it`s expansion with the goal to lead you back to your consciousness in order to escape this state.</p>\n<p>By finding and activating different triggers you interact with the room and it\u00b4s possibilities and finally you are able to swich scenes.</p>\n<p>Hints will be given to you through written\u00a0 text in order to simplify your way through some confusing and complicated scenaros.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to let the user have an uniqe virtual experience which expands it\u00b4s cognition in the virtual world.</p>\n<p>LINK TO MIRO BOARD<br/></p>\n<p>https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/5yk5X5ZcO3dLcDkkKpAIRGxJLcgvuPxriJxUA2jKOWsYkSXv...</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T06:12:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a9f8c2ae915c0ba016db06ac25427a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["./studio3 Virtual Reality Seminar"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
