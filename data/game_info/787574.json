Through his (supreme lack of) charisma, out-of-touch  nature, and success rate at various Bejeweled-inspired puzzles, Askarios  is able to achieve differing endings with his chosen paramour,  resulting in either a positive, neutral, or negative path.<br/></p>\n<p>This  demo covers two dates with each of the game's five dateable characters \u2014  Greg \"Mothman\" Mothman, Bellatrix Mnemos, Eyevan Ocular, Myra Limus,  and a secret fifth option \u2014 the core of the puzzle gameplay, and fifteen  potential epilogues.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story Description:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Zyx \u2014 an empire without border; an empire of ghosts. Long had it stood at the far reaches of the region of Kaz, its diabolic citadels and towering obsidian structures plaguing the natural beauty of the land, standing as edifices of death and subjugation. For centuries did its reach expand, its armies of undeath casting the living to eternal damnation with little difficulty. </p>\n<p>Yet Zyx was weak, for Emperor Xyrik, the last of his bloodline, had grown complacent in his conquest. He had grown careless, and his armies soon stagnated on their advance. Soon, rebellion began, and civil war turned the restless undead against one another. It appeared as if Zyx would have finally fallen, its dominion crumbling with each and every skeletal remain of its military. </p>\n<p>That, however, proved an opportunity. For I, Askarios, Lord of Undeath, Master of Secrets, and All-Powerful (and handsome) Lich Lord of Skentira, staged a coup that overthrew Emperor Xyrik as his focus remained on the encroaching warfront. </p>\n<p>Centuries have since passed, and I, Askarios the Tyrant, continue to rule Zyx absolutely, my rule having never once waned. I once more subjugated those that rebelled against Zyx, culling any who dared attempt to destroy the Empire from within. The dead obey my every command, enslaved to my will, and the living hold such great fear that they cower at the mere mention of my name. My conquest has reached every corner of Kaz, and soon, the world shall know my wrath. </p>\n<p>But there is one issue \u2014 I am lonely. The fun in conquest has grown boring, and I find myself in need of someone to share my sadism with. But as it would seem, none can move past their fears of me enough to even attempt courtship! ...Or they are a mindless thrall, but I have standards. \u00a0</p>\n<p>As a result, my closest minion, Skully, has set me upon a path of \u201cdating around,\u201d as he refers to it. I have been given the knowledge of a far-off city where many suitable paramours may be located. I shall set forth on this journey of love searching on the morrow. </p>\n<p>Ready thyselves, denizens of Paleon City, for Askarios the Tyrant will soon be gracing your lands!</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Cast:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Main Man: Askarios the Tyrant<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Askarios \u2014 Lich Lord of Skentira, Tyrant of Zyx, Master of Undeath... whatever his other titles are today \u2014 is the main man here. The boss is a bit lonely in his all-controlling rule, so I looked to get him someone to enjoy some passionate love makin' with. He's just... gotta get over himself, honestly.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Date Option #1: Greg \"Mothman\" Mothman<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Greg\u2019s a bit of a chill guy, y\u2019know? Think we\u2019re catchin\u2019 him out on his vacation, and to me, that means you two could indulge in some sweet, sweet, relaxin\u2019 love makin\u2019. \u2018Course, he\u2019s a bit... out there, in terms of personality, but I think you two will get along, assuming you can handle his laid-back demeanor and philosophical thoughts.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Date Option #2: Bellatrix Mnemos<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Bellatrix \u2014 screamo enthusiast, airheaded mantis lady, and lover of succulents. Don\u2019t let her thrift shop grandma clothes fool you (she calls it \u201ccottagecore\u201d), she\u2019s a bit of a freak on the downlow. I think there\u2019s some common ground between you two, given that you two both like dark, evil, and dead things, but ya just gotta not let yourself get misled by appearances alone.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Date Option #3: Eyevan Ocular<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Eyevan\u2019s an odd case. The man clearly doesn\u2019t like his job, he\u2019s dismissive of anyone wantin\u2019 to get into his personal space, and he doesn\u2019t like bein\u2019 bothered. Inside, though, I think he\u2019s probably got somethin\u2019 to hide \u2014 nothin\u2019 weird or vile, mind you, but... somethin\u2019 endearing. Just... don\u2019t bring up his eye or the bad pun of his name. Shit seems to annoy him.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Date Option #4: Myra Limus<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Myra\u2019s a sweetheart wrapped inside of a slimy, malleable exterior. She may look sad all the time \u2014 and believe me, she sure acts like it \u2014 but I think she\u2019s just lackin\u2019 in confidence and love. She\u2019s a university student, so she\u2019s probably just stressed out and doubtin\u2019 herself, but that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s unavailable for romancin\u2019!\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Askarios's Minion: Skully Mortis<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>\"And then there's me! I found the boss all these dates in Paleon City, and I'm lookin' forward to seein' how it all goes for him... for better or for worse.\"<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>- <em>Writing/Narrative Design/Game Design:</em> Nick Novello</p>\n<p> - <em>Character Art:</em> Jude Fry</p>\n<p> - <em>UI Assets:</em> Alexis Mayberry</p>\n<p> - <em>Environment Art:</em> Denice Carrera</p>\n<p> - <em>Sound Design:</em> Zoe Maddix</p>\n<p>- <em>Music:</em> Santana Lee Silcott<br/></p>\n<p> - <em>Programming:</em> Michael Nadasky, Jose Villafranca</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to download the game, feel free to click below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T18:03:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cd10d2b847dd67d3b2fbb31e0bbc890.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UghItsMike"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
