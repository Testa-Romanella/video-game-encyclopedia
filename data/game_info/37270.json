Ride superbikes at blurring speeds on authentic race tracks or venues in Paris, doing your best to avoid Parisian drivers. Hop onto an off-road motorcycle and powerslide through countless hairpin curves in motocross and supercross tracks, or try some freestyle, jump off the biggest ramp you can find and rack up points for the craziest mid-air tricks. Finally, beat physics into submission while riding an enduro bike and do your best not to fall off tracherous obstacle courses in the insanely difficult and satisfying trial mode. Moto Racer 3 has got something for everyone and does an admirable job at it, too! The Gold edition comes with tons of improvements, new tracks, new motorcycle models, crazy bonus vehicles and an enhanced graphics engine.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-02T06:29:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f2f/f2fdc4c16129ec0a594955d558098d1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 51, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Delphine Software International"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Nobilis"], "esrb_rating": null}
