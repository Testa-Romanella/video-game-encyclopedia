Set in the late 2nd Century, near the end of the Han Dynasty this war would be one of the catalysts that set the Three Kingdoms period in motion.</p>\n<p>Along with Dao are his childhood friends, the rambunctious tomboy Yuying and the ditzy, but good-hearted, beefcake Xi. After being separated from Sun Jian's army at Liangdong, they must head for Yangren to reunite with their army. But with the mighty warrior Hua Xiong on their tail looking for heads to round out his collection, will they make it?</p>\n<p>Will they reconnect with their army, and their loved ones back one? Or perhaps will they make new connections with new friends? Or maybe even make new connections with each other?</p>\n<p>You decide Dao and his friends' fates.</p>\n<p>Currently 3 possible endings:</p>\n<p>Bad Ending (Dao dies)</p>\n<p>Yuying's Ending</p>\n<p>Wenwen's Ending</p>\n<p>See if you can get all three, or at least the good two.
