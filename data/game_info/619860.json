You control a cube which can change its polarity, and a ball which always has the same polarity. <br/></p><p>The cube and ball can unlink for obvious reasons, however, they must be linked together so you can complete the level. That's how I took the theme for this year's game jam - \"joined/linked together by magnetism\".</p><p>Since this is a jam submission, expect bad art, lack of levels and some bugs :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:27:49", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShadowLT"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
