What you choose may lead to one end, or the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Credits: </strong>This entire game was created by ClariLaGames on Twine, and the cover image was also made by ClariLaGames on Canva.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Other notes:</strong> Submission for the \"Great Harvest\" Game Jam (August 24th to September 21st, 2020).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would love to eventually create an expanded version of this game, either as a full text adventure with more paths and/or endings, or as a Visual Novel. Feedback is welcome!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Due to the colour palette rules of this game jam, the colour used in the background of the game is #e36956.</p>\n<p>The image used for the game is made on Canva, and I used the colours #ff6b97, #f2a65e, #964253, and #473b78.</p>\n<p>This game contains quite a few punny names relating to the Autumn theme.
