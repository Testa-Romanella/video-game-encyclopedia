In the veins of hit mobile favorites like <em>Temple Run </em>and <em>Subway Surfers</em>, players can either choose the difficulty of their run or have it randomly selected for them. The higher difficulties offer more rewards in coins but reduce the chances of success dramatically through increased speeds and a greater rate of the spawning of obstacles. Every time somebody plays <em>Impulse </em>it will be different than the last time, thanks to the procedurally generated tiles that spawn cubes, coins, corner turns, and life-threatening rocks. To beat the game\u2019s three levels on any difficulty, players will need to obtain keys from the randomly created cubes that appear on the track. However, every cube the player picks up could be their last as each cube will either give them a key, an immediate death, five extra coins, or a dreadful increase in speed. The game, pioneered by four AP Statistics students, has been acclaimed as \u201caddictive\u201d and \u201cpainstakingly good fun\u201d by eager players of the current build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:15:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/822/822de5e6ed6bc22f4d293c91a6f03aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VitaPublishing"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
