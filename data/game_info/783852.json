Gather coins, ammo, and weapons to fend yourself against the monsters that have swarmed the town while maintaining your sanity against the paranormal.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse coins to pay for items in the shop system, various weapons to eliminate monsters, and med kits to keep yourself alive. Along your journey you will come across journal entries from townsfolk guiding you to complete essential tasks. This linear exploration is a mix of thrilling and engaging outdoor combat with a touch of horrific scenes and story progression on the inside. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis project was inspired by my favorite FPS games growing up including Resident Evil, Phasmophobia, The Forest, and COD: Zombies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T06:52:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84ee4f463079afa3a0ffea52587d82b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Michael Crowther"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Michael Crowther"], "esrb_rating": null}
