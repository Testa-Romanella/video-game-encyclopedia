Then you make a game for you giftee based on their letter.</p>\n<p>My giftee for this jam was Ashkman. From their letter I extracted two main inspirations: <strong>The Binding of Isaac</strong> and\u00a0<strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>. And since it is the Secret Santa Jam I also wanted to implement the Theme\u00a0<strong>Christmas</strong> into the game.</p>\n<p>Since Tarantino likes to make movies about historical events that end differently than it happened in reality, I searched for what historical events happened during Christmas Time. And what I found fitting was the Romanian Revolution, especially the escape of\u00a0Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu (the President of Romania at the time and his wife) on December 22nd in 1989.</p>\n<p>So\u00a0Operation Snagov takes place on exactly this date. You are a soldier infiltrating the Central Comittee Building in\u00a0Bucharest to arrest Nicolae before he can flee.</p>\n<p>The general game design on the other hand is mostly inspired by The Binding of Isaac. You have randomly generated levels with predefined rooms. You search for items to make yourself stronger and try to survive until the final boss.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Operation Snagov is written in the Godot Game Engine v3.2.1 -\u00a0https://godotengine.org/</p>\n<p>Intro Narration by\u00a0ExoPrism - https://exoprism.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Romanian Flag taken from\u00a0Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Romania</p>\n<p>The ingame font is\u00a0Homespun - https://www.1001freefonts.com/homespun.font</p>\n<p>The ingame Music is from the album \"Voices of Christmas Past\" by Dawn Of Sound -\u00a0http://www.dawnofsound.com/2008/12/voices-of-christmas-past-2/</p>\n<p>The intro music was made with Ecrett Music\u00a0-\u00a0https://ecrettmusic.com/</p>\n<p>Sound Effects taken from All Sounds - http://www.theallsounds.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Source Code available on GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/TLochow/Operation-Snagov</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/510d85357211114538c8f9f5e5d53180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Charlie Gray"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
