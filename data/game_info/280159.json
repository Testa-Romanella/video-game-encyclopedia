Limbs are now a currency, and humans are\r\ngenetically programmed such that they fall off at regular intervals, turning body parts into a\r\ncurrency of their own. Playing as a worker in a limb factory, your character must navigate their\r\nway home and try to navigate the social ladder, hoping to not lose a leg in the process.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Limbphomania</em>  is a 2D platformer/side-scroller where a player attempts to get home from work,\r\nbut is constantly spoken to by those he passes. The side-scroller format was chosen for two\r\nprimary reasons: 1) it is a familiar format that encourages forward movement and speed, and 2)\r\nthe structure of the side-scroller aligned closely with the presented narrative objective of \u201cgoing\r\nhome\u201d, emulating the fixed and seemingly direct path one would take in their daily commute.\r\nWe chose to include platforming elements to appeal to the player\u2019s discovery instincts and drive\r\nto get to the next platform. The only way to do this, however, is to steal limbs, which can result\r\nin narrative consequences. The three platforms are meant to roughly signify class divides in the\r\nmodern economic world, while the only way to advance to a higher tier of society is to engage in\r\nthe very structures which are causing the decay. After all endings, the game immediately restarts\r\nitself, urging players to engage in different (and potentially immoral) actions to experience all\r\nfour of the endings.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Disability Theory and Representation In Videogames</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Disability theorists argue that \u201cdisability tends to be figured in cultural representations as an\r\nabsolute state of otherness that is opposed to a standard, normative body\u201d (Snyder, Brueggemann\r\nand Garland-Thomson, 2002, p. 2). From this perspective, \u201cthe \u2018problem\u2019 is not the person with\r\ndisabilities; the problem is the way that normalcy is constructed to create the \u2018problem\u2019 of the\r\ndisabled person\u201d (Davis, 1995, p. 24).  <em>Limbphomania </em> seeks to make explicit the dominance of\r\nableism in videogames. As mentioned, it is rare to see protagonists of videogames that are\r\ndisabled. This is accomplished in two ways: first, through the narrative world, and secondly,\r\nthrough mechanics.\r\n</p>\n<p>We attempt to depict a dystopian reality through the narrative world of  <em>Limbphomania</em> .\r\nDisability is not a state of normalcy by nature of the world, yet the disabled still deal with\r\ndisability harassment. In a world where limbs decay over time, the amount of limbs one has is\r\nnot the state of otherness previously mentioned, but instead a state of existence that occurs\r\neveryone. This normalcy of various bodily forms are intended to force the player to reconstruct\r\nthe \u201clongstanding associations of stigma with bodily difference\u201d (Snyder and Mitchell, 2006, p.\r\n168). To further push this reconstruction,  <em>Limbphomania</em>  subverts the cultural conditioning of\r\nmovement mechanics. If the player ends up with a limb from those in the lower class\u00a0(differentiated by limb color), the movement keys are reversed, throwing the player out of their\r\nconditioned mindset and force them to rethink what controls they are using. In addition, the\r\ncharacters in the lower class slightly blend in with the background. The dialogue triggers when\r\nthe player walks past them, however, creating the experience of color-blindness in video games.</p>\n<p>With this reconstruction, we hope that the player will be able to empathize with the experience of\r\nthe disabled, and think more about implicit ableism in other forms of media. In addition, we hope\r\nthat the irrationality of ableism is made clear when the disabled are not considered in state of\r\nabsolute otherness, but rather as a human being in another state.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Cruel Commodification in Late Stage Capitalism</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This may sound redundant because there is an aspect of cruelty in all commodification, but\r\n<em>Limbphomania</em>  portrays a very specific type of commodification. Cruel commodification is when\r\nsomething that is necessary to one\u2019s survival, like internet in contemporary society, or even\r\nwater, is commodified. The commodification of limbs is made obvious through the\r\nadvertisements of limbs. The limb, something that is vital to people\u2019s lives, that people are\r\nconstantly attempting to obtain as a means to a better living situation, has become a commodity.\r\nThis commodification is a direct exploitation that appeals to people\u2019s wish for a better life. We\r\nuse ads that are easily recognizable in modern society as a method of Detournement, an art\r\ntechnique popularized by The Situationists, a group of philosophers, artists, and intellectuals\r\nfrom France in the 1950s.\r\n</p>\n<p>Detournement reappropriates objects in popular media and adds their own spin on them. This\r\nspecific detournement asks \u201cWhat are corporations actually advertising?\u201d Many companies use\r\nsexualized women, and create the image of happiness when marketing their products. The\r\nadvertisements of limbs seek to expose the factors often hidden behind these advertisements.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game certainly was created with a Marxist framework in mind, with the different tiers of\r\nsociety being stand-ins for the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Because the player is a laborer in\r\na factory which creates disposable limbs, they are already narratively complicit in the\r\nprofit-driven genetic decomposition of people\u2019s bodies. However, throughout the game the\r\nplayer is provided with interactions which provides ample opportunity to reflect upon the\r\nstructure of the world and illustrates how it is built upon hierarchical inequalities which damage\r\nall. The idea of the exploitation of the proletariat is taken to its logical extreme, where their\r\nbodies along with their wants and needs are driven by the cycle of capitalist industry.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/685/685a2b850eb6834c073019957fd9d5a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jerseyfonseca"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
