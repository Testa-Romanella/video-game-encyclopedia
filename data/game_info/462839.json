At the start of this project we was given a simple blocked out scene in Unity. My task was to then fill in all of the gaps and model the entire scene using Maya. I also programmed in some of my gameplay features into this game.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ichigo is a game based in Japan and on Japanese folklore. Your mission in the level is to find your lost sword which has special powers hidden within the sword.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong><br/>Ichigo started out as a simple blocked out level. My job was to model the environment based on the layout that was already there. Using Maya I had created the assets while also learning how to create 3D art as it was my first time doing so. I also added in my own 3D controller and other smaller gameplay mechanics to make the level feel more like a game rather than just an environment.\u00a0<br/><br/>After the models were completed, I spent the remaining time I had left to UV the models and add my own textures to them. This was also a learning curve as I had never done a UV in my life. The project was originally finished in March 2020 but I went back to it before my deadline in June to polish it and add some last minute touches.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T02:47:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45e/45e3d4557aaad58604046c41c8f5886e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BRADLEY O'NEILL"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
