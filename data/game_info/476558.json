I don't know how to draw pixel art, I'm still learning and still bad, I didn't make the background music, I used free music from a youtuber called RedfeasMusic and it works very well ,I thank him very much. The rest of the sounds were made with chiptunes, the engine is Game Maker\u00a0 Studio 2, and I made the drawings in Gimp even though they look like MSPaint .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:09:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ea/8ea151ccdbcfda8c98f4764dae05c2bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Barbu David Constantin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
