You have 3 health. You can't jump or escape. Your goal is to evade as many viruses as humanly possible.... <br/><br/>Have fun!<br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter @CrypticFools</p>\n\n\n<p>I created this game using Blackthornprod's Udemy tutorial. It was a fun course that covered many things inside of this game. If you like the game, feel free to donate to me. That will motivate me to create better games as times passes and my knowledge of game development increases. Thank You!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T06:42:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2eb/2eb6eeffc92e8da6716684367f67431f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoolProofEntertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
