{"id": 723194, "slug": "dragon-gods", "name": "Dragon Gods", "name_original": "Dragon Gods", "description": "<p>Dragon Gods (name is TOTALLY up for debate) is a story/character-driven rpg. It\u2019s slightly based on the Magical Girl genre in the anime/manga genre, just with a few twists. (Not like the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime. I can do dark, but not THAT dark.) Mechanically and graphics wise I cannot do much with since most of the time I a) normally play games for story and characters so while a very atmospheric game with incredible graphics will put me in awe, that isn\u2019t what draws me into a game, (<em>cough\u00a0</em>Undertale<em>\u00a0cough</em>) and b) my patience with drawing is equivalent to a four-year-old waiting to open presents from Santa: non-existence.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Turn-based combat:</strong>\u00a0Yeah, yeah, it is Rpg maker\u2019s specialty, sue me. This is not going to purely be the default turn-based combat. There is (or should be) real strategy in play so it is not just going to be \u201cpress a, hit, down a potion, rinse and repeat for X number of hours.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>5 main characters:</strong>\u00a0Instead of the typical four characters only party, it\u2019s a five-character party! Whooo!\r\n<strong>A thick lore:</strong>\u00a0While most of the game will take place in the human world, so to speak, the lore of the game is very prevalent in the game. And there is a plan to create a lore book so if the player forgets something they can look it up or there is lore I want to include, but I just couldn\u2019t put it into the game and make it feel natural.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A grand story to be told:</strong>\u00a0This isn\u2019t going to be a simple \u201cFight minions until final boss comes and blast him with the power of friendship and love and corniness!\u201d There are secrets that even the cute mascot characters do not know about!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T05:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3edc6aba40c62758638b8c381c7cbe9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["neocat18"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
