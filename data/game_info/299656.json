This game provides fast-paced 3D platformer experience along with \"impossible\" game challenges that's more accessible to newcomers. <br/><br/>With simple \"touch to play\" experience, it will keep you entertained if you are on the train, on a bus, or simply when taking breaks. This is more of a casual style, fast-paced, adventurous, action platformer game. Each level has a progress bar to help you track your progress. <br/><br/>Your jumping cube flips through obstacles to reach its final destination: the ol' mighty pyramids! Do your best to avoid spikes, moving objects, 3D enemies, moving platforms, ramps and much more. The main objective is to stay alive and flip your way through obstacles to reach your final destination. <br/><br/>You can play with 3 different cube types: <br/>- double jump cube (red cube)<br/>- triple jump cube (dark red cube)<br/>- quadruple jump cube (very dark, cherry color cube)<br/><br/>Each jumping cube has its jumping limits while in the air. Once it reaches the ground, the jump limit resets itself and you can jump again. This is what makes this gameplay unique and entertaining. For each cube type, there are special levels to play with. Quadruple jump cube has levels that can be complete only if the cube can quadruple jump. Triple jump cube levels are suitable for triple and quadruple jump cubes, and so on.. There are many level variations for each cube abilities. <br/><br/>There are also PRACTICE levels to sharpen your skills. Those practice levels are shorter version of the longer levels. They are more \"snackable\" and easier to complete, but once you go to the longer levels to reach the ol' might pyramids is not easy. <br/><br/>Insanely addictive and FREE TO PLAY!<br/>Download now!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac3/ac31a6546cd12087ba08713d8fb41b51_MCLskF4.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Quadruple-Cube-Jump-239784466929592/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hristo Zhelev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Hristo Zhelev"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
