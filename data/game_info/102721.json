It was created in two weeks time for the game jam. The contest\u00a0theme comes from a bible verse\u00a0for encouragement. It is a first person perspective adventure game. You start out in a church, where you gather things to start your mission. Once in the world, you interact with people hurting to know Christ. You encourage them to follow you on your faith journey, and give them helpful advice and scripture. Over the course of your journey, the world becomes more bright and colorful.\u00a0The end goal is to see them attend church and become born again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/595/595abba8e6adb01601239d28abe2ba97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 341, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Christ Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
