She was a tall woman. The autopsy reported that she was extremely malnourished. However, her cause of death was from multiple stab wounds and a cervical fracture. Police were never able to find the killer\u2026 The next year, police walled off the facility. The site is very popular with urban explorers and paranormal investigators alike. Some tell tales of seeing the murdered woman. Others hear screams emanating from the inner parts of the building.

Use your new and improved flashlight to see long distances and scope out an area before advancing further.<h3>WHAT GAMERS ARE SAYING</h3><br/><strong>\"Holy sh*t that was really scary.\" -Markiplier</strong><br/><br/>\"One of the best indie horror games\"<br/><br/>\"This is by far the most horrifying game I have ever played in my life.
