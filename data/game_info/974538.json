Embark on a puzzle-based adventure, as Bucky wanders the vast island of Nulla Terra, helping his friends work off the damages, fix your boat, and get back home!\u201d<br/><br/><strong>What is this? </strong><br/><br/>Shipwrecked (Or Shipwrecked 64 as the internet has dubbed it) was an old game originating from the late 90\u2019s, commissioned by the (at-the-time) beloved Broadside Animation Studio, developed by a relatively unknown game studio, Cogware Games. <br/><br/>The game had a very mysterious nature surrounding its launch, as it was only available from August 13th 1997, to August 17th, 1997, receiving little promotion from Cogware, and none from Broadside. This downloadable version of the game is the closest one can get to playing the original copy of the game. We at the SWRC (Shipwrecked Recovery Crew) were lucky enough to get our hands on an original cartridge, dump it, and convert a lot of the code to new software. With help from two of the original developers, we were able to make this game accessible to everyone. <br/><br/><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br/><br/>\tShipwrecked 64, while portraying itself as an authentic product, is in fact a work of fiction. Some scenes in the game are graphic and violent in nature. Shipwrecked 64 is what people may refer to as an ARG, and will require out-of-the-box thinking, but also travelling outside of the game for answers. It can be very complex at times, and is intended as a community effort of sorts. Forum posts, or even playing in calls with others, taking notes, and other methods are the best way to proceed forward.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Two Modes, a 2023 mode and 1997 mode.
