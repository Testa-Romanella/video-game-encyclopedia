Developed in Unity.</strong></em></p>\r\nWhat is \"Burger World\"?\r\n<p>Burger world is an 18-level puzzle game where a burger eats other burgers. Literally, that's what it is. Complete each level to move to the next one.</p>\n<p>Be careful though, there's a time limit on each level.</p>\n<p>Plus there's some nasty crystals stopping you (not sure why exactly).<br/>There's also some disappearing ledges!! (again, really not sure why).</p>\r\nWhy was \"Burger World\" made?\r\n<p>The game was made in 2018 over a period of about 3 weeks.\u00a0The idea behind creating \"Burger World\" is to show that something cool can be\u00a0designed, built and coded in a short space of time, much like my other projects.</p>\n<p>The game was originally built for mobile devices and every effort has been made to ensure the game works on a standard Windows set up.</p>\r\nWhat PC Specifications do I need?\r\n<p>You'll need at least:\r\n<em>CPU:</em>\u00a0Intel i5 1.8 Ghz or equivalent\r\n<em>RAM:</em>\u00a04GB or better\r\n<em>OS:</em>\u00a0Windows 7 / 8 / 10 or equivalent\r\n<em>VIDEO CARD:</em>\u00a0NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or better or equivalent\r\n<em>FREE DISK SPACE:</em>\u00a0150Mb</p>\r\nWhat happens in the game?\r\n<p>Spread over 3 worlds, you have to collect enough burgers to progress to the next world. Try collecting all the burgers in all the levels. You'll have to think how you can accomplish each level with 100% completion - not every level is as simple as it looks.</p>\r\nAnything else to know?\r\n<p>If something cool can be made in a short time, just imagine what a team can do in a longer period of time. Bugs &amp; glitches will be present, but no game-breaking bugs should exist in the demo.</p>\n<p>The game isn't meant to be taken too seriously. It's just meant to make you smile or confuse you.</p>\n<p>Finally, this game is free. Any donations received will be donated to a charity annually.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2a848ca4ebb4ab94223b97a650141da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jimmy Vegas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
