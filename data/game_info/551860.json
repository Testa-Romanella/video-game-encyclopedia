{"id": 551860, "slug": "wizards-and-warriors-demo", "name": "Wizards and Warriors Demo", "name_original": "Wizards and Warriors Demo", "description": "<p>Wizards and Warriors is a 2d RPG game that I am working on. It will have quests, NPC's, boss fights and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The NPC dialogue system isn't that far along in development yet so not much can happen in that department. A large number of features have a basic implementation but no way to actually gain weapons or craft or speak to NPC's for long.</p>\n<p>One more thing. Unfortunately whenever I update this game, If you had a save it will be wiped. I am working on a workaround for this problem. You will possibly have to download a text file of your save. This may, unfortunately, make it very easy to cheat in this game. However, I am adding a cheats menu so I think it will be fine.</p>\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>V0.8.4 changed the main menu and did some work on saving and loading your game</p>\n<p>V0.8.3 added in some
