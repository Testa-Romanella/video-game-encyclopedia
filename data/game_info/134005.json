A few humans have grouped up in a safe base and now it's their mission to hide among the bots to gain more information.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You</strong> are looked up in a room with bots and other applicants.<br/><strong>Your task</strong> is to identify the other applicants before they catch you!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Game Concept:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Klexos is a mulitplayer game, where the player plays against his friends via Lan. In doing so he has to hide amongst AIs as good as possible, so that the other players can't detect him before he detected them.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to be the first player to detect all of the others, but be careful, otherwise you will die for wrongly detecting too many AIs!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Ashwin Kanatt</li><li>Florian K\u00f6nig</li><li>Jannik Hildebrandt</li><li>Sandra\u00a0Brettschuh</li></ul>\n<p>The game was developed by students in a cooperation\u00a0of the Technical University of Graz and the University of Westminster in 2018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/078/078d928b30d331313d36b3c5c146dcc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sandra Bre"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
