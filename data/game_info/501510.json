Listen in on the conversations of your mother, her sisters, and your grandmother. Touches on topics of loss and change. Takes place in US America with reminiscence of Mexico.<br/></p>\n<p>Based on true stories and events within the writer's family. We hope you enjoy!</p><p>How to make tamales:</p><p>drag masa (left bowl) onto the corn husk, then drag the filling (right bowl) onto the corn husk! :)<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>MOUSE CLICK to drag ingredients together. <br/></p>\n<p>SPACEBAR to continue the conversation.</p>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<ul><li>Please do not hit ESC! It will \"exit the game\" and turn the game screen black. It is a bug we are aware of. \u00a0If you click refresh, it will restart the game!</li><li>Some players may encounter the coveted \"tiny hand\" where the right hand will be significantly smaller than the left. If this is you, congratulations! The game will play as normal, your right hand will just be slightly smaller or as we like to twist it, \"You are a small child making tamales with your mother. the right hand is your hand, the left if your mother's.\"</li></ul>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sam Ortiz - Narrative Writer/Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Cam - Programmer</p>\n<p>Jamie - Programmer</p>\n<p>Caio M.
