I've been feeling a bit burnt out, but needed to force myself to make something.</p>\n<p>I recorded the entire process which will be made available as a time-lapse video soon, where you can see how much time I wasted standing around, meandering aimlessly. Definitely not an efficient development process. At my most optimal development speed, I likely could make this exact same game in an hour or two if I was feeling more inspired and energized.</p>\n<p>All ideas, design, code, assets, and builds were made from start-to-finish within the 4.5 hours, well under the 6 hour time limit for Trijam 66. I used Ecrett Music to generate the music and BFXR to generate the sound effects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae2121e6e353f6cec99d9347b0bb5eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
