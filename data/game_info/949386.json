Using your s<strong>kills of deduction</strong> and <strong>password cracking</strong>, you must locate your targets and flatline them before they can expose your employer's secrets. But be careful - the clock is ticking, and one wrong move could lead to your own downfall. Will you be the <strong>mastermind who outwits the competition,</strong> or will you fall victim to your own hubris?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Neuro Crisis </strong>was made within 4 days for Jame Gam 26 with the theme of \"You are the monster\".\u00a0 Playing as a corpo hacker fits this theme because you are tasked with eliminating potential threats to your company, regardless of their innocence or guilt. You are essentially taking on the role of the oppressor, using your skills to crush anyone who stands in the way of your employer's goals, regardless of the consequences. This is quintessential Cyberpunk genre lore.<br/></p>\r\nHow-To Play\r\n<p>Just use your mouse and wits to play!

However, a downside of this is that it's way too laggy for WebGL. The game played well in Firefox, but was a mess to look at in Chromium browsers.</p></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Linux or Mac builds?</strong></li></ul>\n<ul>I ran into an issue with the Unity video player on these platforms. The game compiles, but most of the UI elements are missing (as they're videos). For Linux users, go ahead and try in Wine. The game will work, but you'll see what I mean and why I didn't want to put out an official Linux version.<br/></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Why vertical aspect ratio?<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<ul><strong>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/</strong></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>I can't play the game, can I see a video of the gameplay?<br/></strong></li></ul>\n<ul>Sure<strong>!\n</strong></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:21:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/395/395167b60fee5e915b3dd5d519fbefa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kunic"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
