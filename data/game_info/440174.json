For now this is just the basic mechanics in the work. If the car flips you will have to restart the program. I haven't added a restart scene button yet.</p>\n\n<p>Note I renamed it Vehicle Simulator 20XX because I am currently deciding a name still.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:43:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2cc13513bbe622bca0febf5d324c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johnny Shumway"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
