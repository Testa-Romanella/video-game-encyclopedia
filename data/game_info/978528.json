The singing saw, with its ethereal tones akin to the theremin, presents a challenge unlike any other instrument. Its lack of traditional markers or keys demands precision and finesse from the performer, with every note subject to the subtle nuances of breath, posture, and movement. <br/><br/>Can you hold the note steady enough? Find out as you embark on the performance of a lifetime, playing your way through a single, 15 minute composition, orchestrated and directed by the greatest musical genius that ever lived; YOU!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Controlled solely by the mouse, the Singing Saw Simulator responds dynamically to your every movement, refusing to \"lock in\" when the perfect note is struck. Prepare to be immersed in the exhilarating uncertainty of musical mastery as you constantly question: am I in tune?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Points are awarded for \u201ccorrect\u201d notes, but no extra rewards are given for high scores - i.e. The points don't matter! Yay! Instead, the game asks that you forget about points and envision the music as an experience; a performance in which you can relax and exercise your creativity in a safe space. To that end, the Singing Saw Simulator features several sections in which the player is encouraged to improvise across the 3+ octave range of the saw. If that sounds scary to non-musicians, then don\u2019t worry; it just means you can mess around.<br/><br/>And remember - if you can create a melody that sounds more pleasing to you than the written one, then please do so. The Singing Saw Simulator acts as a real instrument, so get creative and carve out your own place in musical history!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The accompanying soundtrack, aptly named \"The Masterpiece,\" is a genre-defying opus crafted exclusively for Singing Saw Simulator. From classical elegance to jazz-infused rhythms, from pulsating house beats to twangy country vibes \u2013 each section showcases the singing saw as the star of the show. Get ready to rock out with a dedicated metal segment! Keep up as the piece moves from classical string quartet to New York soft jazz; from upbeat contemporary house to country and western; from horror soundtrack to the psychedelia of the 1960\u2019s.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But the excitement doesn't end there \u2013 with each playthrough, unlock a new spectrum of sounds for your saw, from haunting distortions to evocative vocal effects. Transform your performance on the fly with a simple scroll of the mouse wheel and watch as your music takes on a whole new dimension.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prepare for unexpected challenges mid-song \u2013 from rating your performance to quirky mini-games like whack-a-mole and tic-tac-toe!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why confine yourself to the one performance? Open up your media player, switch to windowed mode, and let your creativity soar in Freeplay mode. Jam along to your favorite tunes, experiment with new sounds, and make every performance uniquely yours.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why'd I make this game? Well. I bought a musical saw. It was difficult to play. But fun. So I hope you have fun too!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T09:50:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a2b8ae2f5b116ce287e43fc643bc778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ryab Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ryab Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
