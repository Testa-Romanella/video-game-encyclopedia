It all depends on public interest.</p>\n<p>If you donate just \u00a31, you'll get access to a small collection of concept art and the image files used in cutscenes as a thank you! All I ask is that you keep these images to yourself and don't share them online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b90/b90625c2d1802935b09c6f31136082de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SandwichHour"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
