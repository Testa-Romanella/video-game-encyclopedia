But no worries, all in-game purchases are just there for player choices and are only cosmetic**. We want that the player feels pride and accomplishment from getting upgrades from DLCs, Lootboxes and Live Services.<br/><br/>Why we put all of that additional monetization into an full priced game*** in the first place you may ask? Good that you ask, our PR department has already prepared the perfect answer: <strong>All that additional monetization is totally necessary in this day and age, because of the immense and constant rising costs of video game development</strong>. Look no further than this game: Even though a lot of the tools used to create this game are open source and free, the cost for the steady flow of soda pops and coffee, that the single developer - who develops this game for us out of his parents basements - gets instead of an actual wage, justifies - in our eyes - the urgent need for all the additional monetization schemes. Because all those soda pops and cups of coffee will not pay for themselves, will they?<br/><br/>So jump right in, into the world of uncountable DLC fragments, Lootboxes and Live Services, to give us all the money in this world.<br/><br/><strong>Legal disclaimer:</strong><br/>- Be aware of satire and irony in the product description as well as in the game****<br/>- Everything - without exception - can only and exclusively be acquired in-game.
