You'll need to traverse a randomly generated map, with 5 bossfights to defeat them all. You'll find shops and treasure on your way, which will help you in your journey.</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Enter - Start Wave, Select, Interact</li><li>E - Use Ability</li><li>M - Mute Instrument Sounds</li><li>TAB - Inventory</li><li>Arrows - Move Selection</li><li>Click and drag templates from the templates tab to place them down</li><li>Click and drag instrument parts onto templates to build the instrument</li></ul>\n\n\r\nQuick Guide\r\n<p>The most effective strategy (that I found) is to get a second instrument right after the first shop. (usually a Xylophone or a Flute, since they are the easiest and cheapest to build). From here, you want to focus on getting as many instruments as you can.</p>\n\r\nInstruments Guide\r\nFlute:\u00a0\r\n<p>The flute ability (that you have by default), knocks enemies back for around 10 seconds. The flute is the easiest instrument to build, requiring only a single part.</p>\n\n\r\nXylophone:\u00a0\r\n<p>It's ability triples attack speed of every Xylophone. Slightly stronger than the flute.</p>\n\n\r\nViolin:\u00a0\r\n<p>When it's ability is used, it summons a Cello for 10 seconds. The cello shoots 10 shots, each dealing 10 damage, which is the highest damage possible without upgrades.</p>\n\n\r\nAcoustic Guitar:\u00a0\r\n<p>It's ability damages every enemy on screen by 10 damage. A pretty strong instrument by itself.</p>\n\n\r\nElectric Guitar: \r\n<p>It's ability increases attack speed by 100% on all of your instruments for 10 seconds. It attacks really fast, and has the best DPS out of all instruments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T10:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed9/ed9959a423bf941d4f669b1cf2def623.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Nitro-Gen Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
