I\u00a0met two of my best friends working on this game, CJ Legato:\u00a0https://treejayz.itch.io/\u00a0and Axel Stewart:\u00a0https://axel-stewart.itch.io/. In this game, you play as Brian the gummy worm while you defend yourself with your bubbles\u00a0from the endless hordes of angry gummy bears. I\u00a0programmed, CJ did all the art, Axel made the audio, CJ\u00a0provided his voice for the fire noise and gummy bears. We came in first at the Game Jam, and I\u00a0still have the bath toy I\u00a0won!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A &amp; D keys: Move left and right</p>\n<p>W key: Jump</p>\n<p>Spacebar: fire bubble gum bubble</p>\n<p>Escape: back to menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T10:23:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf7/bf7d14c7a21d5a61e6b20af528144a15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
