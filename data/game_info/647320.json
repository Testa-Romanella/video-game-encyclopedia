It is not working 100 percent perfect but we try :)\u00a0</p><p>Description:</p><p>Well, what do you expect? Left 4 Dead 3? This is just a 2d platformer game with a shooting mechanic.\u00a0 But we will be very glad if you would like to try it.\u00a0In this game, there would\u00a0no instruction, so i would only explain the instructions here ;).</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Spacebar to jump.</li><li>Mouse and Left Click to aim and Shoot.</li></ul>\n<p>This Game is not truly Complete since we will try to add much more things in this game. Our Plan is to:</p>\n<ol><li>Add Music</li><li>New Enemy Type</li><li>Ammo system</li><li>Healing system</li><li>Diffrent type of Weapons</li><li>Explosive</li><li>Characters selection</li></ol>\n\n\n<p>You need to survive the wave which will be increasingly difficult. And get the highest Score. The Enemies which fall out of the view will spawn at the top again. But you as a heroic guy, will die with honor for falling off from platform. That's all i guess. Feel free to donate if you want. That will just motivate us to work more on this game hihi.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T07:14:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e87f3f8debd7c0ce1c2b9680ee2252.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nixxell"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
