For example, the choice of what dress to wear to a ball or the nuance of a minor conversation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Three personality archetypes you can freely choose between</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Mix and match as you feel fits your Miss Fernside.\u00a0 And based on the choices you have made, the game will track which personality type is the most dominant, and adds variety and color to the text of the narrative.</p>\n<p><strong>A different sort of stat building</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of trying to up the level of affection points you have with a particular love interest, our game focuses on building a narrative around the MC and each potential suitor.\u00a0 Miss Fernside's previous choices color her opinion and inclination towards each one, opening up and changing dialog and interactions as you move forward in the story.\u00a0 </p>\n<p><strong>More to come</strong></p>\n<p>This is a beta for the demo.\u00a0 It is lacking some features we plan on adding like: original theme song, music, and sound effects. This build is mostly to make sure the game works well and to iron out any issues before a proper demo release and Kickstarter.\u00a0 But this also means that you are one of the first to play our game EVER. Yay!\u00a0 We really appreciate you taking the time to play and look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To meet the main characters see below.\u00a0 <strong>WARNING</strong>: Minor spoilers beyond this point.</p>\n\n\r\n~ Main Characters ~\r\n\n\n<p>The daughter of one of the most prominent families in Davenbury. Beloved for her beauty, spirit, and wit, now that circumstances have changed, you help to shape her personality and how she navigates the challenges ahead.</p>\n\n\n<p>Childhood friend, and Miss Fernside's first love, Guy Linfield, inherited the neighboring estate, Halbridge, after the unexpected passing of his father and elder brother a few years ago. Having been separated for a year, while Miss Fernside traveled abroad, and now, with new social pressures placed upon both Guy and Miss Fernside, how will the change in prospects affect their relationship?</p>\n\n\n<p>A loyal family friend and longtime companion to the Fernsides, Mr. Worthington, spent much of his life in trade before settling in Davenbury. His father sold off the family business a decade ago and bought the entailment to the long, empty Chalton Manor.\u00a0 His father, dying not long after, left to Mr. Worthington the manor house, and life as landed gentry. However, the idleness of a country gentleman has never come naturally to Mr. Worthington, even after all these years.</p>\n\n\n<p>Ashore on half-pay, and awaiting a new commission, Cpt. Sinclair is the guest of Miss Fernside's cousin, Ludlow. Since his arrival, his name has been on the lips of every gossip in town, rivaling even Miss Fernside's as a favorite topic of discussion. But with the Captian's easy charm and playful smile, he has never had a problem ingratiating himself into any society he finds himself in. And Davenbury seems to be no exception.</p>\n\n<p>To stay up to date on the latest news, follow us here on Itch.io.\u00a0 And/or follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Instructions for download</strong></p>\n<p>Windows Version:</p>\n<ol><li>Download\u00a0<strong>Truths Untold Demo - Beta 0.5-pc.zip</strong></li><li>Open downloaded zip</li><li>Extract the\u00a0<strong>Truths Untold Demo - Beta 0.5-pc</strong> file to desktop (for simple access) or other\u00a0location.</li><li>Open\u00a0<strong>Truths Untold Demo - Beta 0.5-pc</strong> file from location (ex.
