The theme was phase so we made a game about ghosts who could phase through walls. It's a co-op platformer. Touch the orbs to be able to phase through different walls. The last level's door doesn't actually lead anywhere.</p><p>Instructions:</p><ul><li>WASD for one player, arrow keys for other</li><li>Space bar makes both jump</li><li>Yellow floor panels makes you phase through certain walls</li><li>White floor panels remove the yellow power</li><li>Both buttons in a level have to have a player on them to activate</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a9398aa2b4080e7c54d2db7eea6f477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Impmaster"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
