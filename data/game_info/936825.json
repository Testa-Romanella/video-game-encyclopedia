{"id": 936825, "slug": "cat-squared", "name": "Cat Squared", "name_original": "Cat Squared", "description": "<p>Cat Squared is a small and challenging puzzle game created in one day for the Mini Jam 127 game jam with the theme \"Cat\u00b2\" and limitation \"Use this Mini Jam's Color Palette\".</p>\n<p><strong>How is the theme incorporated into Cat Squared?</strong><br/>The number of cats in each level is the square of the level number. So level 5\u00b2 = 25 cats. Originally the game was going to be the square of the number of cats in the previous level but by level 5, there would have been 65,536 cats. Oh and the cats are square shaped.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the limitation incorporated into Cat Squared?</strong><br/>Unfortunately the limitation is very loosely incorporated in the game.\u00a0I couldn't find much use for the colours in the given palette. The colours from the limitation palette can be found in cat bowls, cats, and the background of one of the levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Walkthrough</strong><br/>The game might be very challenging for some people and for this reason, I have uploaded a 6 minute walkthrough to YouTube if you are unable to pass a level.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game jam so don't go too hard on me please :)<br/>P.S. if the cat glitches into a block, just restart the level by clicking \"R\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T07:58:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7ed9c42a47289405f20f03bada2f71e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Electro Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
