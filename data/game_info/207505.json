The controls feel a bit weird and the Dash mechanic is strange. I am satisfied with the music and art though, and it feels good to finish within the week! It has some bugs so please be patient with it, and the jump button does not always work, I have no Idea why... And sometimes you get two robots... <br/></p>\n<p>Instructions:<br/>Move - Left and Right<br/>Jump - Spacebar<br/>Dash - Spacebar + Direction in air</p>\n<p>Get to the pipe to beat the level.
