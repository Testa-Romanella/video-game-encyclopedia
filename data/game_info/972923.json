This will only be possible for them if they have been activated. And depending on the battles or the episodes during them, the activation limits will be more or less important.<br/>Madrid is emblematic of the Spanish Civil War, one of the tensest battles of this conflict which could have ended the war earlier for the Nationalists if they had won it. In this game, you can play both sides, Nationalist or Republican; against another player in PBEM or in hot seat, against AI.<br/><br/><strong>Scale</strong><br/>In this specific game, units are mostly battalion-size. The fighting takes place in the hills and plains west and south of the Spanish capital, and on the immediate outskirts of the city. Some \u201coff map boxes\u201d are also integrated to represent more distant areas (where close strategic points such as air bases are located). <br/>Each turn is the equivalent of three days.<br/>The game elements consist mainly of ground units and some air units.  There are many types of troops and vehicles as were present there by the end of 1936. The political aspects of the battle are handled by events and cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>SGS Battle for Madrid</strong> covers the period from 9 October 1936 till 15 January 1937, where the direct assault was active, before the battle turned to a distant siege situation till the later fall of the city in 1939. <br/>At the beginning of the battle, there are few troops on both sides and the quality and power advantage is clearly in favor of the Nationalists. However, time plays for the Republican, as they get more and more unit as days are passing, allowing them to strengthen the defenses and hold the core of the city safe. <br/>The game will contain a grand campaign scenario covering the battle from October until January, as well as other (intermediate or shorter \u2013 see below) scenarios based on different starting days or limited to specific areas (Jarama, the University, etc\u2026) of the battle.<br/>We plan to also provide the players with interesting options to explore potential what-if situations.<br/>The player will also find in the game historical events. <br/><br/>Those can be strictly historical or random depending on their nature, and/or depending on the game setting (historical scenario or what if). A more efficient Republican Command? More troops for the Nationalists? Soviet intervention or Axis support is more, or less, present? Leadership on both sides can play a crucial role, as well as the will to fight of the Republican, represented by a \u201cNo Pasaran!\u201d (They shall not pass!) index that will boost them when it grows, provided their defense holds long enough. <br/><br/>Most events generate even more immersion, sticking to a historical reality. All are carefully designed, with extensive historical research, to go beyond the game, to bring its playful dimension closer to what could be a highly interactive history book.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong>Scenarios</strong><br/><ul><li> Early Attack: a 15-turns what-if scenario that supposes that the Nationalists make a straight attack against the city a month earlier, September to November 1936. Limited to the central part of the map.<br/></li><li> The Coruna Road: a 10-turns scenario on the fierce battle in the wooded hills and rough terrains northwest of the city, in winter and foggy weather, December 1936.<br/></li><li> Battle of Jarama: a small 8-turns scenario in the southeastern outskirts of the city, Feburary 1937.<br/></li><li> Madrid Grand Campaign: the complete battle, from October 1936 to February 1937 (33 turns), with all the units, the full map and many events and cards.</li></ul><br/><strong>Estimated Playtime</strong>: from 1h to many hours\u2026 with great replayability.<br/><strong>Favored Side / hardest to play</strong>: depending on the scenario played and in the campaign it can alternate, being harder for one side at one point in the game before becoming easier (and harder for the opposing side).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-01T08:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1a4a2786638c48fa4c1f1a3102c0dba.jpg", "website": "https://strategygamestudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 360, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Strategy Game Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Avalon Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
