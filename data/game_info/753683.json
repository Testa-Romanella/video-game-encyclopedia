The player needs to adjust the situation in the arena, so that the boss inflicts damage on himself.<br/><br/>The plot and characters of the game are inspired by the coming-of-age theme and Japanese mythology.<br/><br/>Game duration - about 3.5 hours</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>Kitsune is a naive little fox who dreams of becoming a cool nine-tailed fox. To do this, he needs to use his soul for the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons (Hyakki Yagyo), and for this he needs to leave his house and go on an adventure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The adventure itself is an initiation, a coming-of-age and acquaintance with the real world.<br/><br/>Monsters are metaphors familiar to the player - lies, cruelty, betrayal, temptation, etc.<br/><br/>In the cover of a fairy tale, there is a hidden path that everyone has traveled. and it is primarily about studying the world and yourself through its prism, about kindness hidden under a creepy nature and about the fact that growing up and exploring the world is an exciting adventure. (sometimes risky)<br/><br/>In the end, it turns out that this path is only the first step to becoming a nine-tailed fox. Kitsune gets a second tail, but more importantly, a new self. he still has a long way to go. (the story can be ended both at this point and a sequel can be released)</p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>The gameplay is divided into 2 parts.<br/><br/>Visual novel - tells the character's story and lets the player explore the world between battles.\u00a0 The voice of the narrator will lead the player through the story.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>All decisions made by the player during the visual novel affect the boss gameplay, what buffs fox gets/doesn't get (+1 life for example) and how the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Boss-fights - These are 1 vs 1 battles, where the player needs to move around in the arena with the boss and match his attack timings in order for the boss to deal damage to himself. the player cannot attack. Boss battles are the climactic viewpoints of the chapters.<br/><br/>All bosses are unique both in terms of visuals and gameplay.
