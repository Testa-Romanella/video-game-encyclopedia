A demo more than a prototype, but maybe somewhere in between. It was made by BoredSkeleton and Willkshakes of Pumpkin Head Training Dummy. It was built on the Hitbox/Hurtbox framework created by Rat Casket, purchased in the 2020 Racial Justice Bundle, and uses a pause menu and font from jasontomlee that you can find on the yoyo marketplace for free.</p>\n\n\n<p>Novissime Rex is the story of the last dinosaur. The dinosaurs had long reigned over their era until the rise of the mantises. The Mantises were able to reproduce their ranks very quickly and overwhelm the dinosaurs.\u00a0 As the sun began to set on the old era, the dinos hatched a plan. Under the light of the full moon they would perform a dark ritual. This ritual would bless their warriors with immortality, and the ability to grow in power by shedding Mantis Blood\u00a0 to enter a Flow State.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were ambushed during the ritual, and all were slain, except for the first and only soldier to undergo the ritual...
