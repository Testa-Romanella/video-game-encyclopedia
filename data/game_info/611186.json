So sorry, if there's several bugs and other things. <strong>To play, you need 2 players and one of them will enter a desire code then share that code to the other player and join using that code.</strong></p>\n<p>You may gain firewall warnings. Just click allow, it's 100% safe, the reason it appears because this game is multiplayer and needs internet connections</p>\n\n<p>Currently, there's only available for PC. Android is in the works.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Developed by:\u00a0<strong>NicDev</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Music: <strong>Evan King</strong></p>\n<p>Special thanks to: <strong>SadBoy</strong></p>\r\nLinks and Stuff:\r\n<p><strong>Subscribe to My Youtube Channel:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/NicDev</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Support Me On YT Membership:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/NicDev/join</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Join My Discord Server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/WNyjtNc\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>See Developments On My Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/bukan_nic/</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(Keep in mind that all of my social media is Indonesian language)</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>@2021 NicDev</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T07:35:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/9016424d39a2501eae81481d5c7ab610.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NicDev"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
