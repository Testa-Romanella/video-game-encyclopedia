My game \"up-Lifting\" takes the theme literally, by having you play as a bro at the gym, helping his other bros get a good workout in by boosting their stamina with protein bars and tons of space-bar mashing. This is the first project I've ever worked to completion, and although I wish I had a little more time to polish a few things, I had a blast making the game and I hope you have a blast playing it (or at least get a good laugh out of it).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:33:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/571/57143eab7c43e3ae2053a6f29682050b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hatchface3000"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
