The selected light ray appears thicker </li><li>Use LEFT and RIGHT arrows to change the light ray's color</li><li>Once you matched the waveform, confirm with C</li><li>The dark gray wave shows the difference between your waveform and the goal</li><li>There 7 levels in total.</li></ul>\r\nHints\r\n<ul><li>The goal has irregular maxima and minima, try setting some of the input light rays' maxima and minima to match those.</li><li>Once you get close to the goal waveform and have some matching maxima/minima, try changing one light ray at a time. If needed come back to the state where you were close. </li><li>If you notice regularity in the difference waveform, you are probably close. If the difference oscillate fast/slow, try changing one light ray to oscillate fast/slow</li></ul><p>Created with Pico-8. <br/></p><p>Source code on gitlab<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d4/0d4c0a19f5bf7b9859523d583d5c358b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cereale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
