You hear a sinister voice say in a radio near you, \u201cYES!!!! YES! I HAVE DONE IT! HAHAHAHA! IT\u2019S ALIVE! OH, IT\u2019S ALIVE, YOU SEE! MMM\u2026 YES, YES! RISE MY BEAUTIFUL CREATION, RISE!\u201d<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Soon you realize that you are this sick Frankenstein creation.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you speak?\u201d says the voice over the loudspeaker.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u201d you say.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent! It looks like everything is working, your core memories are in your hard drive and your training will begin shortly! Are you ready to get to know yourself?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThat will soon be explained! Don\u2019t worry about that now! We MUST get started before Jaime wakes up. Are you ready?\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI have so many questions -\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind that! We MUST-\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>You hear a loud crash somewhere in another room.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn! You wait right here I\u2019M WATCHING YOU! Jaime has woken up...\u201d\r\n</p>\n<p>There is a soft *click* as the radio shuts off.\r\n</p>\n<p>Now you are left alone in a room with a surgery chair with some surgery tools next to it along with a light right above it.\u00a0 There is also a counter next to the chair with doctor things on it like jars and a sink, also a flashlight. Under the sink there is a key. The key unlocks the door. When you open the door you hear a sound, almost like a scream, but not quite.\r\n</p>\n<p>When you step out of the room there is a hallway with many other doors. One of the lights is flickering and all of the doors are locked. There is also a vent on the floor at the end of the hall. This opens and you can crouch into it. It leads to a higher part of the hospital, where you find patient rooms. This is another hallway and you can go in several rooms.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T17:09:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/552/552b8db1c7c25963fd552eaed49a6897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frenchyboy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
