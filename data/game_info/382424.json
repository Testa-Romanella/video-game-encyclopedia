( But not for the faint-hearted )<br/>Game-play does get repetitive, but I request you to go through all the endings.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Mouse to click dialogue box/action button.<br/>No Keyboard input.</p>\n<p>Use HEADPHONES for best audio experience.<br/>All Audio From https://freesound.org/.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T10:04:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d2/3d2b0507f930fadaa63f1b5e2c2bbfa1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["neetesh6499"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
