It was written with a two fold purpose. First, to practice programming skills in the Ink programming language. Second, for entry in the InkJam 2018. In its current form, it is more of a test of concepts such as dynamic text replacement and variable management. In the future, I plan on expanding the game to have a random combat manager and increase in game size. It is very playable and has a simple scoring system and a few puzzles, reminiscent of traditional interactive fiction. I hope you enjoy my first foray into IF.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e16c8e9144fdc32be31e1fd260b4383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Widowsson379"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
