So this is a prototype of Colony Battle, a roguelite kinda isometric shooter. You control a mech, packed with miniguns, flamethrowers, rayguns and rockets! In this build, you will see concepts, like controls, bullet types, enemies behaviour, models and\u00a0more ideas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There is 3 gamemodes, Sandbox, Challenges and Survival. In Sandbox, you can test the controls, the guns, the enemies and give a look on some models and entities we made. In Challenges, you will have 3 challenges to complete, test your ability to survive without guns, make more points before the time runs out or run the gauntlet and reach the finish line. In Survivel, you ll fight 50 waves of enemies, each wave harder than the last one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We want this to be a roguelite,\u00a0 with levels and runs like Binding of Isaac, Dungeon of the Endless, Risk of Rain and etc, but we still dont know how, so any feedback on it will help alot. Actually any feedback on anything in the game will help, tell us if you liked or if you hated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks alot for checking it!
