The challenge?</p>\n<p>You control how difficult the path will be!<br/>By choosing cards at the beginning, you decide if you want to face Kappa rooms (easy) Tengu rooms (medium) or Yokai rooms (difficult).<br/>Mix and match, but be warned: if you choose more cards you get more points, but only if you manage to clear all of the dangers without taking damage!<br/>You can see that the cards have icons that indicate buffs and debuffs: some infested rooms give you the power to do some things, some rooms take that away. So look for them before you choose!<br/>Good luck!<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Help / Controls</strong><br/>\n</p>\n<p>WASD or arrows - Walking<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Left Shift - Dash<br/>AD or &lt; &gt; arrows - Wall Slide</p>\n<p>Music Credits go to: zagi2 - koto and shamisen loop 2.wav (freesound.org) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>This game was made during the InnoGames Jam 13\u00a0https://igjam.eu/jams/igjam-13/<br/>Jam Entry: https://igjam.eu/jams/igjam-13/873/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T14:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0da0ddd7d6148c05be8e886ce292154.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Konstantin von Wendt"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
