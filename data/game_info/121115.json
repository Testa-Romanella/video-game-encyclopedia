Your settlement progress has been spectacular, and although you're nearing retirement, you've managed to expand the colony from its meager initial size of 100 adult citizens in a valley, to over 1,000 residents of all ages spread over several outposts during your tenure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the 'Sustenance and Nutrient Generator' you were given seems to be malfunctioning, as the animals being created have recently exhibited violent behaviour and are now chasing down your people as they flee to the founding settlement.\u00a0 You need to set up defenses to slow the tide of violent animals, while you begin a search for a lasting solution.</p>\n<p>This game is a unique fusion of tower defense strategy and visual novel, with branching dialogue and four different endings.\u00a0 As you play, the AI uses machine learning to discover what offense is the best against specific defenses.\u00a0 It takes into account the pathing, water hazards, and even the genetics of the animals which it controls indirectly by selecting the best specimens from its own evolving evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c9/3c928f05a0b47da5378aa9a600a06343.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cabrill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
