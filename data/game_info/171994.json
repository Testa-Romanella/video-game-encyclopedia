It starts to go faster as you 1. have more pages, or 2. have more chase stacks (when you run and stop, you'll notice the static screen gets more opaque, that means he runs faster). If you run through the trees, you can clear all chase stacks. That's how to escape him.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: </p>\n<p>Sprites don't belong to me.
