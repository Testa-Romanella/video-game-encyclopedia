According to investigators, the developer is suspected of being involved, and may possibly be a key suspect for leaving the game and attempting to destroy evidence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T08:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b41/b414c5e61c2afa575b3952e341bf4f21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jivapeira"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
