{"id": 456290, "slug": "dot-recall", "name": "Dot Recall", "name_original": "Dot Recall", "description": "<p>Dot Recall is a puzzle/adventure game designed to test your ability to problem solve. The game forces players to use\u00a0forward thinking to formulate plans in order to successfully progress through the level. The game includes color manipulation, trampolines, portals, ramps, doors, locks, keys, shrink orbs, flashlights, and even lasers. Lots of lasers. See if you have what it takes to collect all of the\u00a0golden coins of each of the levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several aspects of the game are still in development. Future updates will includes an entirely new main menu, additional sound effects, jetpacks, and some more, much needed,\u00a0easier levels. I also have not tested the mac download, so let me know if that works.</p>\n<p>Feel free to send any comments, bugs, or questions to me at\u00a0tidesofterragos@gmail.com.
