Is it technically a prequel? No, I'll do what I want lol</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is THE game. Well, not just a game, more or less this is an\u00a0<em><strong>experience.</strong></em> I think it's best for you to see this game yourself, rather than go into detail here. There's not much to explain, anyway. This game can be completed in 3 minutes or 3 hours, depending on your skill. Will you be the fastest? I hope so.</p>\n<p>What lies at the end? What happened to Brae before Marisphere 2? Is Bowsette just a trend or is it here to stay? All that and more is answered in Marisphere.</p>\n<p>(Mario belongs to Nintendo, Sans belongs to Toby Fox, the song is \"Don't Cry,\u00a0Jennifer\" from Clock Tower on SNES.
