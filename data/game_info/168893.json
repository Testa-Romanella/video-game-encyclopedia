However, to do so, you will need to sell some of your existing pieces to get the funds.</p>\n<p>When your turn ends, any pieces not purchased will be discounted, and the shop will be restocked.</p>\n<p>When a piece is taken, it is sold and its owner receives a refund for it.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is completely mouse controlled - aside from the Escape key to quit.</p>\n<p>It is also a bit of a work-in-progress. It could use some polish.</p>\n<p><em>(Based on the Pleco chess engine - https://github.com/sfleischman105/Pleco - which works superbly. Any issues with the game itself are completely on me.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19a80384db21db541dd78cfb1aa8c06d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Mistodon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
