Wanting to live forever, a mighty king sends his army of knights to find the Cup of Life. On this quest, you will summon knight after knight to be brutally sacrificed. Impale knights on spikes to create a safe path. Catch a knight on a sawblade to land the body on a button. Freeze knights into blocks of ice to reach higher ground.<br />\nYou\u2019ll also electrocute knights to open doors, blast knights out of cannons, and even zombify a knight to be your violent, dim-witted friend. As you journey through treacherous and trap-ridden worlds, you\u2019ll show no mercy to solve each challenging puzzle.<br />\nIn this game, death is not a setback. It is your only means to progress.Key Features<br />\nYou must die to solve puzzles.<br />\nWe hope you\u2019re okay with killing knights, since this is a pretty twisted way to solve puzzles! Dying is your only way to progress. As you sacrifice knights, you&#39;ll figure out how to use the dead bodies with the mechanisms in the game to solve each challenging puzzle.<br />\nMorbid, yet comical gameplay.<br />\nYou\u2019ll kill so many knights, you might even feel remorse! But flinging a bumbling knight into a saw blade or turning one into your violent, puzzle-solving friend is comical. Trust us.<br />\nVibrant, trap-ridden worlds.<br />\nJourney through 65+ levels within four vibrant, colourful worlds full of lava, ice, spike pits, portals, zombies, cannons, and much more. And there are extra-difficult challenge levels for hardcore puzzle-addicts.<br />\nUnlockable hats and weapons. (Silly ones, of course!)<br />\nCan you find the Cup of Life wearing a horse head? On top of solving puzzles, you&#39;ll be able to unlock amusing hats and weapons. Your knights will spawn wearing silly hats, like beanies and berets, and wielding even sillier weapons, like dead fish and spatulas.<br />\nFind Jeff!<br />\nWho is Jeff? Well, he&#39;s furry, cute, and lurking in every level. Will you be his friend?<br />\nChallenges!<br />\nThere are awards for solving levels with the least number of knights and completing them in record time!<br />\nLife Goes On: Done to Death also includes a kick-ass boss fight, a map-integrated storyline, an armoury to check out all your hat and weapons, and other features that will make you laugh at death.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2014-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T13:00:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5d4ec9ca420bde7b617c19e00b7074.jpg", "website": "http://www.lifegoesongame.com/", "rating": 3.14, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 328, "beaten": 10, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 16, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 38, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 579, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Infinite Monkeys Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Infinite Monkeys Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
