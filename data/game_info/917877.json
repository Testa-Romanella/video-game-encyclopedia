As the captain, you can order those you command to do your dirty work for you, but don't be fooled you will have to take matters into your own hands from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEmbark on the open world of the Caribbean. There are many opportunities for those who seek them during the Golden Age of Piracy. What will you do? Perhaps, become a privateer and work for the crown and hunt down notorious pirates, including the infamous Edward Teach more commonly known as Blackbeard! Or will you become a pirate yourself and plunder the Caribbean for all it has to offer. On the other hand, you could always become a simple merchant travelling port to port acquiring the best deals, until your coffers are full to the brim. Maybe the sea life isn't for you there is plenty to explore on land as well, cursed temples, dangerous caves, treasure filled beaches. Whichever you choose, I'm confident you'll make the right choice....
