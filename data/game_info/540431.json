Full disclosure, our guests haven't been sleeping too well recently. Even worse, their bad dreams have been coming to life. Not good.\u00a0We hope you can survive the nightmares and help us repair our humble hotel to it's former five-star glory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use WASD to <strong>move</strong> your guest within the confines of our hotel.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>During the day, our fearful guests can be found in their rooms wandering about. Help placate them using your handy\u00a0<strong>vacuum\u00a0</strong>(left-shift).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>When nighttime rolls around, nightmares will begin to manifest. The more afraid our guests are when they fall asleep, the more will appear. Use your\u00a0<strong>blaster\u00a0</strong>(click or hold down left-mouse) to remove these unsettling pests.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Convert\u00a0<strong>fear\u00a0</strong>into\u00a0<strong>moxie\u00a0</strong>by using your vacuum on scared guests as well as the fear particle dropped by nightmares after vanquishing them.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Use moxie to renovate the hotel. This is the only way to end our\u00a0night-marathon once and for all. The<strong> renovations kiosk</strong> can be located at the bottom of our foyer (press 'E' when nearby to interact).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the meantime, feel free to make use of our lovely\u00a0<strong>gift shop</strong> located at the north end of our hotel (press 'E' when nearby to interact).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>One more thing: if you inherit a guest for too long, they will become <strong>fatigued</strong> and will need to take a breather. To prevent this use the\u00a0<strong>character selection menu</strong> (hit space during the day) to swap with another guest. Be warned: when you inherit a new guest, you inherit their fear as well (which may affect your speed)!</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for helping us out! It means a lot.</p>\n<p>- Management</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>Robert Buckley (robertbuckley), Ben Sulzinsky (bgsulz), Josh Gardos (gardosj)</p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TOOLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Game Engine: <em>Unity</em></p>\n<p>Artwork: <em>Affinity Designer</em></p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<em>Ableton 10</em></p>\n<p>SFX:\u00a0<em>Audacity</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:31:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2ac574599765f5a8fcc72b49f56e946d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["robertbuckley"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
