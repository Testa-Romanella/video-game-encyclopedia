{"id": 403675, "slug": "pixurvival", "name": "Pixurvival", "name_original": "Pixurvival", "description": "<p>Pixurvival is a super sandbox in a pixelized world.<br/></p>\n<p>There is two very different, separated aspects:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Play the game</strong>, solo, or with friends,\u00a0with the included \"Vanilla\" content or with other player creations. In various game modes such as cooperative survival, team battle, in a procedurally generated map.</li><li><strong>Create your own Content Pack</strong>, thanks to the intuitive (but ugly)\u00a0editor, and share your own universe, playable with your own game mode.</li></ul>\n<p>With the editor, you can import your own tiny images, and set almost everything: items, crafts, spells, map elements, creatures, including their AIs, without any IT skills.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is focused on multiplayer (but of course, also playable in solo), farming, surviving, combat mechanics, and more things in the future (RPG, factory...). It is already ready for \"survival\" game modes, beat 'em up,\u00a0and almost\u00a0ready for battleroyale-like game modes !</p>\n<p>The included \"Vanilla\" content, was made with the content editor, it has for main role to showcase what it is possible to do, and makes the game playable \"as is\", with game modes including cooperative survival and (soon) battleroyale.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul><li>The game requires the Java client (version 8 or later), if you don't have it, you can download it here.</li><li>Unzip the archive somewhere, and run <strong>pixurvival.jar</strong>, that's it!</li></ul>\n<p>Refer to the file \"<strong>Controls\u00a0and commands.pdf</strong>\" to know controls and optionally the available commands. TL;DR: move with W\u00a0A S D, left click for base ability and right click to interact with map elements, some control keys are shown in the in-game UI as a reminder, in yellow.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: the game mode \"cooperative survival\" is also made to be played in solo, I'll change it's name in the next update.</p>\r\nHow to run a server\r\n<ul><li>First, you will probably have to\u00a0setup port forwarding\u00a0(unless for LAN), the procedure may vary depending on your router. The server requires TCP and UDP port 7777, this port number can be changed (see below).</li><li>Open a command prompt, and set the current directory to the installation directory (fast way for Windows: Shift key + Right click inside the installation folder -&gt; then choose \"Open command window here\")</li><li>In the command prompt, run the following command: <strong>java -jar server.jar</strong></li><li>If you want another port number than the default 7777, for example 8888, then run instead:\u00a0<strong>java -jar server.jar port=8888</strong></li><li>You can now connect to the server in the multiplayer menu of the game, using the IP address of the machine and the port.</li><li>If you have custom content pack in the <em>contentPacks</em> folder of the server and start a game with it, players who don't have it will download it automatically.</li></ul>\r\nHow to create your own content\r\n<p>If you have creativity to express, you can create your own content with the editor. The editor is intended to be intuitive, but there is too much to say to for this page, refer to the file \"<strong>Getting started with the ContentPack editor.pdf</strong>\". An exhaustive wiki is planned for the future.</p>\r\nDISCLAIMER : Development in progress\r\n<p>The game is in active development phase. There is still important features missing, such as an in-game\u00a0pause menu. There is known and probably unknown\u00a0bugs. I'm working on this project alone, during my free time, and this takes a lot of it, I'm on it for about... 4 years! I publish it prematurely in order to have feedback and suggestions. During the beginning of this\u00a0early development phase, you can <strong>claim it for free</strong>, meaning that you will <strong>own the game forever</strong>! But feel free to support the project by putting the price you want, giving feedbacks, and bringing your friends!\u00a0I hope you'll like it :)</p>\n\n<p>Follow me on facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/pixurvival</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:31:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/098/098d51c26d8203781e8dc386ad55c17c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pixurvival"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
