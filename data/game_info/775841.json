He does this by exploring each level, finding the large coin at the end, and that clears the level. The game is won by finding the gold trophy. Each level has a slightly different theme that matches the darkening sky to show time passing as he progresses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gameplay Goal: My game best fits advancement and completion. It is not heavily complex nor beautiful nor any of these other things. It's focus is entirely on advancing forward to collect\u00a0gold, maybe kill a few monsters on the way, and complete each level as best as you can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Workload: All me. I did not team up with anyone. I credited some scripts to the professor from the previous 2D platformer\u00a0project, and all of my assets from a creator called Lidfar through the Unity Asset Store.</p>\n<p>Contribution: As I did it by myself, my focus was on the game as a whole. But I guess my one hope going into it was to make something slightly goofy that a player could finish quickly and think that it was a fun little game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T12:30:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/701/701f35872cfbe96f089fdb61137bd037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iklaus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
