I\u2019ve had the support of some wonderful people, without whom Playne would not have been possible. I am eternally grateful to you early adopters, beta testers, friends and family.<br/><br/>I would ideally make Playne free - because I would like the benefits of Playne to be freely available to everyone. But this is my first game and I need to generate revenue so that I can spend my entire time building and developing Playne further.  I want to offer as much of my time and effort to bring about a happier world, even if its just a wee drop in the ocean. I hope this page tells you what my game can do for you, and I hope Playne can help you experience all the benefits of mindfulness.Why am I making Playne?I love meditation and I love playing video games. I think meditation is an extremely powerful tool that can help us live a better and more joyful life. You don\u2019t need zufus, incense sticks or crystals to experience the astounding benefits of meditation. All you are doing is learning about yourself and learning how to cultivate awareness. But I also know that sitting down and doing nothing can seem a little strange and challenging. That's why I've made Playne, because it's more than a game, its meditation.<br/><br/>Made with Love in Scotland!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf5cc960c788c54366ffaee1c0f82d0.jpg", "website": "https://www.playne.co", "rating": 3.83, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 87, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vismaya"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Vismaya"], "esrb_rating": null}
