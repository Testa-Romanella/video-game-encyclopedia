Regardless if this be of the Divine or otherwise, all life strives towards an end that those who live might deem significant.\" ~ Vrenmasil<br/><br/><strong>The great hunger of the Abyss has finally been sated, but still not all is well.</strong><br/><br/>Conflicts of divine ideology flare up once more in a magnitude not felt by the world since the collapse of the holy city. The world has been born twice over since then, but the scars of the past have yet to be mended. The Night Blade - a relic of the Dark that has tasted the blood of the Goddess Nyfrulia - has once again fallen into mortal hands. With it, a shadow spreads over a nefarious but otherwise visionless empire, its regiment reforged by the rise of a usurper whose true nature can only be attributed to his crimson eyes.<br/><br/>Fear being pivotal to his sovereignty, his reign has seen the village of Hronulum being cast into the depths of the sea and anyone who might oppose his order - Night Blades or otherwise - being made an example of through ghastly means of execution. Many seek to claim this man's life if nothing else than for the greater good of humanity, but justice eludes humanity's grasp and so the world remains lost in shadow...<br/><br/>What would drive a man to such ends, where even those who swear allegiance to him would rather him dead? Does he know the pain he's causing with his own existence? Is it possible that he feels the way they do but is too lost to know freedom? Only the crimson eyes can see.<br/><br/><strong>What To Expect:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Engrossing History:</strong> Extensive effort has been put forward to fully realize the history of Eylin and how it affects the time in which the player engages in shaping its future. Not only will you see it play out in real time, but those who go the extra mile to explore will discover special Mementos that open the door to fully interactive campaigns that further flesh out how the world has come to the modern day. Engage with the heroes and villains of history and become educated on the who's, where's and why's of Eylin.<br/><br/><strong>Strategic Combat:</strong> No matter your play style, all measures of overcoming your foes have been improved to their fullest - making all choices not just effective but engaging, too! Every elemental class comes tied with its own statuses that shape the flow of battle, and to go with this magical system are equally robust melee specializations. Each weapon has specific abilities inherent to their class, and with every character capable of dual wielding, the customization possibilities are vast. Even shields can be dual wielded as weapons for those who prefer a \"tanking\" class!<br/><br/><strong>Characterization Aplenty:</strong> To go with all the ways to explore and master the world of Eylin is a cast of protagonists and antagonists with their own motivations that develop throughout the game. From the very beginning, you're introduced to those who dream of a new life. As your understanding of each character expands, so does their relations to each other. By the end of the Tale, no one is as they started - all organically affected by the wages of everyday life.<br/><br/><strong>Riches Abound:</strong> Hidden throughout the world are many treasures, and some require great effort to obtain. Not only will you encounter many traditional treasure chests, but exploration of the countryside will yield fruits from a gladiatorial arena, a shady treasure collector and his riddling runes, a guild of fisherman and the hidden wealth of those who have separated themselves from a world of endless war. Wherever you go, there is always something to be found - even beyond the reaches of mortality.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/>12+ Hours of Gameplay<br/>Intricately Woven Story<br/>Developing Characters<br/>Immersive Combat<br/>Extensive Optional Content<br/>Six Historical Campaigns", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T02:10:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64de82f601447cc851a14f66ef6eaa0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Corfaisus"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Corfaisus"], "esrb_rating": null}
