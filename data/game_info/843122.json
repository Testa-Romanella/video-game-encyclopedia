Uncover things as you go.<br/><br/><em>My comment:</em></p>\n<p>This game is actually made over a busy school week. Initially I thought I would be worse off, but it turns out I actually got more time to sketch things out, so I can just implement them right away with minimal hesitation\u00a0when I get the chance to. Despite the shortcomings, this is the first thing I've ever made that\u00a0I can actually take pride from. I will be using this as an entry for my co-curricular studies in my school.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Brackeys, for his\u00a0tutorial on dialogue system and audio manager; Grant Marshall, for his Architext font.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T09:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a7f/a7f095effb83ff649442f2c6185d47c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["CreeperXD"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
