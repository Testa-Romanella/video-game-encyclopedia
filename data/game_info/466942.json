Your goal is to reach the end marked by a checkered flag. (well I guess maybe not on the first level) .To do this, you must transfer between Androids infecting them. Unfortunately, your control over them isn't absolute, in just a few seconds, they will realize your presence and begin to self destruct. You will then have to exit them before your demise and infect a new Android. However you can't be outside of an electronic body for long, so infect as quick as possible.\u00a0 \u00a0(Theme relation being limited control over the androids)</p>\n<p>Press SPACE to exit the TERMINAL and ANDROIDS</p>\n<p>WASD to control ANDROIDS</p>\n<p>MOUSE to control your virus when exiting a body.</p>\n<p>Music made with beepbox.co</p>\n<p>FIRST DISCLAIMER: There are only three levels\u00a0<em>(read below) AND BIG BUGS</em></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0SECOND DISLAIMER:\u00a0</strong>This was made on Scratch,\u00a0 as of now\u00a0 the only programming language\u00a0know how to use. Scratch is meant for beginners (I am too lazy to learn a better language) and as such it is not the best engine. Often times there are issues that seem like they can unrefutabely be a problem with the engine, and not my code. And sometimes the limitations of the language\u00a0 really makes things inconvenient. This game has bugs and below I will list the one you will probably notice, the ones you won't notice, and the one that caused there to be only only three levels. But considering this is my first game jam, my limited engine, just the 48 hours, and that I have a large horde of incomplete projects, I am proud of what I made despite the many many flaws. I think the idea was great just some infuriating code that got to me.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>BUGS:</strong> The thing you were waiting for... maybe<br/></p>\n<p>Major Bug: LASERS FLIPPING PERMA DEATH IM SORRY. Basically, when a laser hits you, it causes you to die like normal but for an unknown reason, it doesn't trigger the code allowing you to respawn. I know it has to do with the terminal because it doesn't go back to the \"ready\" animation, but there is no reason I can think of for it to not recieve the die signal ONLY when hit by a laser.\u00a0 ;] Also apparently you sometimes get perma deathed WITHOUT hitting a laser (just learned that recently) so I don't know, this wasn't my best\u00a0 for my first game jam, but I too lazy to try and go back, find the bug and fix it. Im sorry, but I just got fed up with the strange bugs to actually try to fix the ones that may have a solution.</p>\n<p>Minor Bugs: Very very occasionally you\u00a0can infect an android without entering it.\u00a0The problem there is one I am either 1 too lazy to fix it or 2 I can't figure it out. Your guess.\u00a0 It has to do with the fact that the virus and android aren't linked because the android is a clone limiting it's communication abilities. So sometimes the android will think it touched the\u00a0 virus but the virus doesnt think so. Another that I just realized after uploading my screen shot as the cover image is that the flag at the beginning isn't going to the goal and I'm mad because I already uploaded the project and that wasn't happening earlier so :p. Finally, sometimes the music jitters when looping because I have no idea, there is a set amount of time before looping the song so it shouldn't do that but I guess thats just how its gonna be.</p>\n<p>The evil one:\u00a0 So the reason why I couldn't make more levels I believe is Scratch's fault. Essentially, a signal is sent out whenever you reach the goal to tell sprites to go to their new positions. Going from level 3 - 4, everything works EXCEPT the code for the androids. The android code is unique because it has to account for respawning them after they go boom whenever you lose, and they are connected together because winning and losing is basically the same thing: lose-make more clones\u00a0 win-make more clones in new spots.\u00a0 The problem with this is that the code I used for going from level 3 - 4 is the EXACT same as the code for\u00a0 1 - 2 AND 2 - 3. Literally, I checked it many times. And I know it isn't the win signal not being sent because all of the other things work.\u00a0 So I blame it on Scratch because... I don't know what else to blame. Besides, even if the code worked, I would still only have 5 levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cb/0cba2682e9bbbcce43cde98cd9738d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["The Malix"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
