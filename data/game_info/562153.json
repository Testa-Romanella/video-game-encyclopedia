It was made in early February of 2021 as part of the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1 where the theme was \"Stronger Together\".</p>\n<p>You navigate the dark levels with a candle revealing scary shapes as being nothing more than furniture (coat racks), and collecting teddy bears as you go to increase your comfort level and field of view.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lot of the ideas that I had didn't make it into the game because of time (it was my first game jam), but I am pretty happy with what I managed over the course of the week.</p>\n<p>All assets in the game were made entirely by me with the help and support of my loving wife, Victoria. I plan to release a devlog of the process on YouTube. Search for SatchmoPlays and/or Comfort Devlog.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Comments and feedback are highly encouraged! Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:23:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d35a5eafd44234deb8f03499be9ec5df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["satchmo1991"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
