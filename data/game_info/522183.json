If any one of them tipped this balance too far in any direction, it could surely spell doom for all life as we know it.</p>\n<p>One day, a creature born of pure chaos attacked each and every colour, ripping away their precious protective charms and corrupting them with hatred and evil.</p>\n<p>The only way to bring them back to who they were is to cast out the chaos and return their respective charms. But who could do it? Well, luckily 2 colours (or shades, rather,) made it out safely; White and Black, who before this point had never experienced consciousness. Now we find ourselves following the story of these two shades as they explore thiss world for the first time solving puzzles and getting to know each other. This is the story of Frito and Brock!</p>\n<p>If you find yourself stuck somewhere, be sure to click on the characters on the title screen to see a mini tutorial on their moveset!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c84/c842fa973ae610e59c49dcb996c9aed0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamPaktGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
