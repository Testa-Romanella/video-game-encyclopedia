All you have with you is your compass and a map of the entire island, with a good spot to camp already marked on it. Using the compass, the map, and the landmarks around you, make your way to the campsite marked on the map!</p>\n<p>This game is short, the landscape is procedurally generated, and the player and camp spawn points are randomly generated. I'm excited about this concept, but I couldn't flesh it out quite as much as I'd hoped within the seven-day limit. Hopefully I'll be able to revisit this later on!</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move. Hold Q and E to access your map and compass, respectively. Press R to reseed the map, or Escape at any time to quit.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made over the week of 12/6/2020, as the twelfth in my deck of many games, where I try to make a game a week, every week, for a year.
