So the game gets faster and faster, creating a hectic and furious feeling and steadily challenging the player.</p>\n<p>If the game becomes too fast for the player, the blocks stacking high and the block-buildings have many gaps, the games speed decreases dynamically to let the player find his way back in the game and dissolve his miss buildings.</p>\n<p>The reward for the players effort is the score, steadily increasing, and a goldberg at the right side of the screen, steadily growing and changing from bronze to silver, gold and diamond. In normal mode he/she is also able to enter the online highscore list to compare him/herself with other players around the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f18bd5992763486fd1fc9310febf3b5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S4G School for Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
