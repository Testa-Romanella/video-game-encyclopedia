Pilot a ship from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and back. Take part in prototypical canal transits. A full 1-to-1 scale re-creation of the manmade waterway that changed the world, the Panama Canal! <br/><br/>A LITTLE HISTORY<br/><br/>Taking two countries over twenty-five years to build, the Panama Canal was the project they said couldn't be built. They said man and machine lacked the ability to cut thru mountains and the Continental Divide. They could only be right for so long. Begun by the French under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps after his completion of the Suez Canal, and completed by the United States, the Panama Canal opened for passage on August 3, 1914 and significantly cut travel time by sea between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and cut out the extremely hazardous journey around Cape Horn. Requiring the removal of 200,000,000 cubic yards of dirt, rock, and mud, and loss of thousands of lives due to accidents and disease, the Panama Canal is one of mankind's most important engineering accomplishments.<br/><br/>WHAT TO EXPECT<br/><br/>Simulating a journey thru the Panama Canal allows you to gain an understanding of what to expect on the real journey. After a trip through my Panama Canal, you will be graced with the knowledge a seasoned mariner would need in order to approach such a journey with confidence. If you plan on taking a trip through the Panama Canal then this simulator will teach you the canal waterways, the sea approaches, anchorage and port locations, and the locations of lighthouses, range lights, buoys, and signal stations.<br/><br/>If you've never been thru the Panama Canal in real life and never expect to take such a journey, have no fear, a trip thru my Panama Canal will satisfy your desire to travel through such an exotic and meaningful place with no risk at all. You'll be able to discuss this journey and its importance with anyone who has taken the real thing. And you'll probably be able to teach them a thing or two.<br/><br/>Panama Canal Simulator was built to accurately simulate the distances and times involved in transiting the Canal and it's surrounding waters. A full-journey will take over 24 hours and when you are done you will have experienced something most people only dream of.. a journey through the Panama Canal.<br/><br/>THE SIMULATION<br/><br/>Start just outside the canal and follow the buoys and range lights into the canal, or take the long approach from 100 miles out in the Caribbean or 170 miles out in the Pacific and spend some time at sea as you look for land and lights. Choose your time of day. Transit the canal at night using nothing but the lights. Accelerate time or immerse yourself in a real-time simulation of an overnight canal transit and hours at open sea. <br/><br/>Drive legendary ocean liners, cruise ships, or Panamamax container ships, or sail thru the canal on the winds of the Isthmus of Panama. Meet ships along the way and take care to avoid collisions. Watch for traffic and signals in the canal or watch the sun rise and set over the Caribbean and the Pacific. With buttery-smooth physics, rich vivid graphics, and ultra-realistic atmosphere and lighting, Panama Canal Simulator will set the standard for PC simulator games for years to come.<br/><br/>Nautical charts and Digital Elevation Model data were utilized to accurately recreate this dream world to an unbelievable level. With accurate latitudes, longitudes, elevations, and distances, and shorelines, lighthouses, and major features accurate to within meters, this is one of the most prototypical 1-to-1 scale digital environments possible. <br/><br/>Conquer one of the seven wonders of the modern world.. Conquer the the Panama Canal!.. One for your bucket list!
