{"id": 253781, "slug": "mozart-for-viola", "name": "Mozart for Viola", "name_original": "Mozart for Viola", "description": "Mozart for Viola is a great app for musicians of all ages and backgrounds to help improve their music reading skills in an entertaining casual game. The brand-new Viola version shares many of the features of Mozart 2 Pro and includes the Viola, Letters and Solf\u00e8ge instruments.<br/><br/>During the game notes are streamed from the right side of the screen. They have to be named in the order of their appearance with the current input instrument (i.e. Viola). Once a note gets too close to the clef on the left side of the screen it disappears in a cloud of vapor and the player loses one life. For each note named in time the player gets one point or more depending on level. The further the game progresses the more notes will appear in this steady stream and their range will widen to potentially include many ledger lines above and below the staff. Once a player has depleted all her lives the game is over and she might receive a high score.<br/><br/>Players have many options to customize the game and target specific areas in their reading progress. Options like setting a key signature, studying specific positions or starting out with half speed. All 4 strings can be detuned (scordatura) and left-handed stringing is supported as well. For the more advanced the start level can be adjusted to include a wider range of notes and note indicators can be set to plain display, scale degrees, note names and tone syllables. The new note info view in Mozart for Viola displays instrument pitches in music notation as an aid to look up notes one might have missed during the game and missed note highlighting points out the location of those notes that got away. <br/><br/>Designed for the beginning musician as well as the student and professional, Mozart is an excellent tool towards better reading in 12 minor and major keys, practicing Solf\u00e8ge, unfamiliar keys, clefs or just to have fun while learning. It is a great way to spend those couple of minutes in-between with a casual game that is fun and educating. <br/><br/>Instruments<br/>\u2022 Viola<br/>\u2022 Letters (C, D, E), Solf\u00e8ge (Do, Re, Mi)<br/><br/>Features<br/>\u2022 Very intuitive interface<br/>\u2022 All major and minor keys<br/>\u2022 Customizable clef<br/>\u2022 Adjustable tuning<br/>\u2022 Adjustable start level<br/>\u2022 Supports movable and fixed Do<br/>\u2022 235 instrument sounds<br/>\u2022 Missed note highlighting<br/>\u2022 Support for left-handed players<br/>\u2022 Training mode for range practice<br/>\u2022 Adjustable scale indicator display<br/>\u2022 Half-speed mode for beginners<br/>\u2022 Extensive documentation<br/>\u2022 Top ten list<br/><br/>You may want to consider the Mozart 2 Pro app (http://apple.co/1SfVVoc) which is also available on the App Store.
