The virus H8K9 created in a private laboratory was sold to a terrorist group, who had a desire to vanish North America from the map, but nobody could imagine the consequence of this attack. Instead, to kill people, the virus has transformed human beings into cannibals as zombies.<br/></p>\n<p>For this reason, many governments to avoid the virus spread created quarantine areas in most of the big cities, and Toronto was one of them.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, the intelligence of Canada knew that in Toronto, a company developed a cure for this biological pandemic. Many elite strike teams were sent to get the cure, but none of them have returned. As the last resource, Canada and United States Governments joined forces to send one single man to get the cure. This man is called Gruff Snake Plissken a one-eyed lone warrior. He has the skills to eliminate anyone without compassion just to accomplish his mission, which is to enter into the city, take the cure, and <strong>Escape from Toronto. </strong>He is a convicted felon, with no willingness to help the government. To convince Plissken to go to hell and come back, the Government infected him with the virus, which gives him 96 hours before he became a zombie.\r\n</p>\n<p>Plissken will use all his skills to survive or die trying to <strong>Escape from Toronto.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:14:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb2/fb2c2b7981614d702532ab8d8c709906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZeusAC"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
