This presently available iteration serves as a demo of sorts.</p>\n<p>This game has quite a large cast of characters (coming in at 16, one for each of the existing types) that you get to encounter in groups of four, depending on which track you choose at the beginning. Come back and play through all of them to meet all the MBT High students!\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is also a gender-blind gaming experience: you can romance anyone, and all the characters will be interested in you.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>The web version takes ages to load, so downloading it might be a better idea.
