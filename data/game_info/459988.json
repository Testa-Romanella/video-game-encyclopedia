Merchants ships\u00a0carried luxury goods\u00a0such as tea, silk and porcelain from Asia to the West. In return, the Asian goods were exchanged\u00a0for silver, medicine and all manner of Western contraptions such as clocks, watches and cartography instruments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alas, such endeavors were not without considerable risk. Following the shipwrecking of their mother vessel, your crew must start anew in the distant lands of the Orient. Undeterred and no less determined, your crew has mustered what little gold they could to purchase a small ship in one last attempt to recoup their losses. After all, fortune favors the bold in the age of merchant empires.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>OpenGameArt.org for contributing artwork and reference sprites.
