Discover a spaceship MOBA game with 2D combat in 3D environment, wide variety of play styles and fun gameplay for casual and pro gamers alike.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play - a game chock-full of what\u2019s cool about spaceships shooting each other up and with none of that boring stuff.<br/>\r\nWe set out to make a game with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play.<br/>\r\nSo we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn our game you will discover that: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS EASY <br/>\r\nA videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional navigation makes you dizzy and disoriented. But in CLR you struggle against your opponents, not against your controls. We simplified gameplay just enough so you wouldn\u2019t need to BE a great star pilot to FEEL like one.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS INTERESTING <br/>\r\nNo boring parts, only what you come for - going into combat to send some rockets into the other guy\u2019s hull.<br/>\r\nAnd if you eventually get a little tired of shooting, and start looking for more - be sure that we will give you more. Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS FUN <br/>\r\nWe don\u2019t really know what \u00abrealistic\u00bb starships will look like, so we don\u2019t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship. <br/>\r\nWe streamlined our gameplay as much as we could, and then we turned the coolness knob up to eleven!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec6/ec6576c6592bc580d38f82d36f73423a.jpg", "website": "http://www.clrgame.com", "rating": 1.67, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 347, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Net Games Laboratory"], "genres": ["Action", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Net Games Distribution"], "esrb_rating": null}
