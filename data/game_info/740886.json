After the first day in-game, the protagonist finds that they have a pet dog companion. The strange thing is that the dog is in color. On this second day, a miracle happens! The protagonist can begin to see the inner world and emotional color of everyone they meet throughout the day, creating an often contradicting <em>duality</em> of people\u2019s external presentations of themselves versus their innermost desires. After using this emotion perception ability, are people's true hearts and their appearances the same? Does everyone have their own inner dilemmas and desires? How will the protagonist make a choice when they see people\u2019 s true hearts? It's all up to the players to explore!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48e2a1872bb906a4eabef9d76cf4db2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["illiand9"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
