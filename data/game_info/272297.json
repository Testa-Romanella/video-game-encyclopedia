Order an entire kilo on a pallet, and watch as your life rapidly spirals out of control!</p>\n<p>-Self medicate your crippling depression by watching television and neglecting the well being of your offspring!</p>\n<p>-Work at a fast food restaurant and get yelled at by angry customers!</p>\n<p>-Take a fancy vacation to an exotic locale!</p>\n<p>-Spend all your food money on a 60-inch flatscreen!</p>\n<p>-Be fiscally irresponsible!</p>\n<p>Become Genghis Khan, probably!*</p>\n<p>-Eat nothing but greasy piles of sludge and die of congestive heart failure!</p>\n<p>This game has EVERYTHING. But it's more than just a game; it's an INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE. A true MASTERPIECE devised and executed by a MAD AUTEUR on par with Hideo Kojima, Stanley Kubrick, or maybe, like, Chris-chan, I guess.</p>\n<p>Honestly, this game's a lot more grounded than I probably made it seem in the description, but it's a novel\u00a0experience of what it's like to live in poverty. Please enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>*Note: This game does not literally allow you to become Genghis Khan.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/6648f0ffd874e25dbd4d16a2e76294c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scooterrito"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
