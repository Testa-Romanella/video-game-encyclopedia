Take advantage of limited opportunities to guess a random four digit number. Every time you guess, you can get a prompt about whether the number and position are correct, until you guess the correct answer (victory), or use up all opportunities (failure). According to different difficulty and guess times, corresponding points will be obtained.<h3>Game mode</h3>In simple mode, the answer does not contain duplicate numbers. <br/>The hard mode may contain repeated numbers - which will greatly increase the difficulty and, of course, obtain higher points.<h3>Achievement</h3>Unlock new achievements after obtaining certain points or completing specified tasks.<h3>Expectation</h3>If more people like it, we hope to continue to improve it, especially the introduction of battle mode and leaderboard, so that people from all over the world can play together.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T05:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/86169e5dfaf5e8f33f5e073f4c54aa4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarcusFromOz", "ClassJoy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ClassJoy"], "esrb_rating": null}
