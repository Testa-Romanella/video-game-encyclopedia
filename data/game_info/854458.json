Watch out for Alphy, who is always hungry for letters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom a grid of 36 tiles, you tap two at a time in an attempt to find a pair of matching letters. When you find a pair, you'll get that letter to use to spell words. In addition to letters, there are also power-up items to find on the board that will assist you. Such as a time increase and a bomb that will explode the remaining tiles on the board to generate a new board.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlphy is a curious little monster who hangs out on the board. If you get a pair of matching Alphy tiles, he will come out of the machine and eat one of your collected letters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWords must be three or more letters, and your earn more points based on the number of letters used.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game ends when the countdown reaches zero, and a final score is calculated.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe gameplay consists of memory matching and utilizing your collected letters to spell the longest words possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDr. Atoz is a vocal guide in the game and will give you feedback on how well you're doing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlpha Pairs is currently in development and will be available by Fall 2022.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T05:56:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95e/95e4b01357c0714d2a240dded78abb35.jpg", "website": "https://embraceware.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Embraceware"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Embraceware"], "esrb_rating": null}
