Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, \n      and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to \n      outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are \n      down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up \n      that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the \n      race!\n    </p><p>\n      Key Features:\n    </p><ul>\n<li>\n        JOLT \u2013 A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects\n      </li>\n<li>\n        VOID \u2013 Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Chaotic, fast paced rounds\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Skill and Timing based gameplay\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Multiple Tracks\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Multiple Game Modes\n      </li>\n<li>\n        Create your own Robot\n      </li>\n</ul><p>\n      The JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race.

If the player can time its use correctly; \n      they can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through \n      an obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n    </p><p>\n      Once eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID.
