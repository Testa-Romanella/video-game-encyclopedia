Willing to give anything to save their people from a cursed plague, they will fight the Blood Gods minions, and make great sacrifices for the greater good in this turn based combat game inspired by Darkest Dungeon.<br/></p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Artwork by Amy Cotton (http://www.amycotton.co.uk/)</p>\n<p>Programming by Finn Truman (https://finnttruman.wixsite.com/portfolio)</p>\n<p>Game Design by Matt Heinrich</p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Barbarian's Mighty Cleave and the Ranger's Barbed Barrage\u00a0can sometimes not hit as many enemies as the ability is meant to.<br/></p>\n<p>The Temple Guardians have wide hitboxes, which can overlap with another enemy's. So when you click on the latter you might click the Temple Guardian instead.</p>\n<p>The Blood Nightmare and Plagued Bloodhorror's sprites cover up the green targetting ring that appears when choosing an ability that needs to select a target. Rest assured, your ranged and spirit abilities\u00a0<em>can</em> hit them!</p>\n<p>Some spirit cooldown abilities do not go on to cooldown.</p>\n<p>The final boss has some incorrect behaviour. It tries to use some abilities early and can make melee attacks from too far away.</p>\n<p>Damage indicators sometimes overlap. This is most prevalent at the start of a combatant's turn that has multiple status effects applied to them.</p>\n<p>Very rare game crash caused by a draw event. Requires a restart. This might have been fixed, but since we do not know what conditions the bug operates under, we can only speculate.<br/></p>\n<p>- - -</p>\n<p>Made in GameMaker Studio 2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b0/7b0e9ab450d41a41de03507ac9ff7a38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["finnttruman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
