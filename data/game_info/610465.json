The goal is to be the top of the Leaderboard (have the highest level)</p>\n<p>How it works?</p>\n<p>First you need to create your Kaiju. You can name it and draw it yourself. after that the game starts.\u00a0 Your Kaiju can do 2 things:</p>\n<ul><li>Destroy Cities: This is the Idle mode where your Kaiju levels up over time (1 level/hour)</li><li>Fight against other Kaiju: you can beat other Kaijus to level up quicker. But if your Kaiju dies, it needs 5 hours to recover, so its a risk. The chance to win is based on your and your enemys level. (you will see your win chance)</li></ul>\n<p>Im really exited to see your Kaijus :) good luck to be the best ;)</p>\n<p>Alright... I did not think it would be that fast but of course... If you give people control to draw anything, then there will also be some stupid people who cant resist to draw none safe for work content. Im really sorry for that... I hope it will not get too messy... :/</p>\n<p>The full code of the game ist on\u00a0GitHub!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T04:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5e63adbf38ed60031a2cfca0db0bec6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DropMania"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
