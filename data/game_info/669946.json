{"id": 669946, "slug": "aiming-circle", "name": "Aiming Circle", "name_original": "Aiming Circle", "description": "<p>Aiming Circle is a game where the circle goes quick bouncing around as you try to aim it toward the squares to break them. Though be careful! Going at the squares at low speeds is bad. This game is joined in a tiny contest between me and Miyaki where the theme is<em> <strong>aim</strong> </em>and <em><strong>phase</strong></em>. If you are seeing this, play Miyaki's game here (no link yet) place in the comments which game is better and feedback. Note this game has 2 modes. Casual if you want a really hard game (like the others) where you have to break all the squares without dying. Also note, squares will keep on spawning from the top spawn point. In endless, you just have to stay alive and break as many squares to get score. The triangle is also your enemy and is invincible to momentum. Also to know when you need to refill momentum, the square spawn point at the top (though deadly) will spin and the inverted color means you have enough momentum.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Aim by dragging the circle backwards using the <strong><em>mouse</em></strong>\u00a0and it will fling the other way and to change the mode in the screen, <em><strong>Space\u00a0</strong></em>to slow time (though the momentum will go a lot faster) and to play the game in the menu screen and when the game ends.</p>\n<p>Credits: All be Takago :) and Palette by Snowy Owl</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T05:12:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d965dd3e8b44221b482c0ac4a25cc8b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Takago"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
