Swap tiles around on a set of ever more difficult boards as you try and reach the highest possible score on each. But be careful! Making an ambitious swap can never come free, and you may have to sacrifice tiles along the way to a high score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play the game using your mouse, simply select a tile and then another to swap it with. Each different color of hex has a different method of generating points, and the arrangement of hexes determines your final number of points.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Made as a team by members of the CSU Game Developers Association in 70ish hours (we were aiming for the compo time, but it is the weekend before finals) and with no pre-made scripts or assets (other then sound, but lets not talk about that).\u00a0</p>\n<p>* Miles (Programming, Unity)<br/>* David (Programming)<br/>* Jonathan (Programming)<br/>* Dylan (Art)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff84c123033a7a17b3e520ea55f9f496.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["smilewood"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
