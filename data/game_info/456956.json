Initially, it was only meant to be a test-project for starting to learn a new programming language, but with help from Daniel da Silva it quickly developed into a small game.<em> (He also made the Linux Port possible - yeah!)<br/><br/></em>You can also run the game on a Raspberry Pi if that's something you're interested in - just download the source code and compile for your needs. Or do whatever else you want with it, I honestly don't care. <br/><br/><strong>Key-Features:\r\n</strong><br/>- that awesome 1980's feeling you love and missed so much\r\n<br/>- 4 endings you probably will find\r\n<br/>- 1 ending you probably won't find\r\n<br/>- references to dumb memes you even forgot existed\r\n<br/>- guaranteed high-speed performance on every system (even on a potato if you somehow manage to run the game on it)\r\n<br/>- two colors and a ton of words</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1e/e1ebfeaf0885bbd39d2d6241439ea365.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["cigarettesandcode"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
