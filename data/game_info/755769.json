While working on this project I\u00a0have become a better coder, dipped into shader work, learned a lot about the don'ts of level design and just experimented with different tools. While this isn't my most recent/finest work I\u00a0feel like it will serve well as a benchmark of my skill progression.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The game is lacking polish and there are most likely a decent amount of bugs. If you have any feedback please feel free to share it, I know that this project is far from perfect but I'm using it as a learning experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The goal of the game is collect 3 tools scattered around the island, then escape on a boat.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Space - Interact</p>\n<p>Left Mouse - Equip/Unequip Torch (when you have some)</p>\n<p>Right Mouse - Use FireCrackers (When you have some)</p>\n<p>Escape - Exit menu</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>\n<p>I used various assets from the Unity Assets store, some free and some purchased. I also used some sounds from FreeSound.org.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:34:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/799/7997cb5501de8f1d12fbcf9b29742711.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Jastrzembski"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
