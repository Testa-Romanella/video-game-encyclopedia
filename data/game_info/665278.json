All of the effects are emulated with the context of it being pretend\u00a0play. The word choice in the text dialogue at the start and the game title help bring together the setting of this\u00a0being a childlike game. The audience isn't necessarily aimed towards children.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Base Game, models, and sounds created by\u00a0Max Myers!</p>\n<p>Assets, Tools and Tutorials I used:</p>\n<p>Sound Assets Used:</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/astrand/sounds/318782/\u00a0</p>\n<p>I reversed this sound by astrand using audacity because it made more visual sense for the engine to be starting up\u00a0not slowing down.</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/malakme/sounds/468926/</p>\n<p>Used Malakme's sound effect and manually copy and pasted a loop for the audio to match up with the length of time.</p>\n<p>Asset Store:</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/tgu-skybox-pack-...</p>\n<p>I used the Newdawn skybox made by Babycake Studio from their TGU Skybox Pack.</p>\n<p>Youtube Tutorials Used:</p>\n\n\n<p>I used this typewriter effect tutorial by Fire Brain Games with minor edits to the code as they used the text\u00a0system not TextMeshPro. I used unity's manual and some forums to work out what I needed to add to the code to\u00a0get it to work!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:27:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a5/3a57fd2b08338bb97322cf1c5b2b753e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pntherart"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
