As part of their role in the community, priests had the responsibility to\u00a0visit every person near death to hear their final confessions, pray for them, and give them Holy Communion.</p>\n<p>But when the Black Death began to sweep through the population of the continent, the Church was as unprepared to deal with the disaster\u00a0as the rest of the world. In attempting to fulfill their responsibility of caring for the sick and dying, many priests and other religious\u00a0fell victim to the plague as well.\u00a0Others, in the face of incomprehensible\u00a0destruction,\u00a0abandoned their parishes and fled to save their own lives.</p>\n<p>With so many of their number\u00a0dead or missing, the Church was forever changed, as the hastily-trained replacements\u00a0were generally perceived to be less scholarly and worthy of the extreme respect that the clergy had once held.</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>All content made by Kris24.\u00a0</p><p>Made for the Historically Accurate Game Jam 2.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T16:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/2976c1d4438d683cff4005e2c9ac73c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kris24"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
