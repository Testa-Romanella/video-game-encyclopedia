Use your botanical skills to navigate the treacherous alien landscape and find a way to refuel your rocket, but be careful... the plant life might not be vegetarian.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to collect all four solar flowers and then return to your rocket. Seeds you pick up along the way will give you access to new plants that you can plant and harvest fruits from. Various optional collectibles also offer an extra challenge.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming</p>\n<p>- Bartosz \u201cSztobar\u201d Szewczyk</p>\n<p>Art and Level Design</p>\n<p>- Lucas \u201cShogun\u201d Michalczyk</p>\n<p>Music and SFX</p>\n<p>- Daniel \u201cDans17\u201d Sousa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T13:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53c/53c7b4ce49bc623241e9d61ac9d4c5ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["shtobar", "Shogun", "Dans17"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
