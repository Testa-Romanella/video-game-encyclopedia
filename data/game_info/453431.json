With these portals, the player is able to do things from throwing enemies out of the level to skipping ahead in the game, being that the physics are perfectly recreated.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, of course, you can configure many different options. First, in an awesome wink to Team Fortress 2, you can put any of more than thirty available hats on Mario. Next, you can choose the colors of both Mario's clothing and the portals that he generates.<br/><br/>This character personalization will come especially in handy when it comes to playing multiplayer with friends, as the game allows up to four Marios to launch portals in the same game at the same time.<br/><br/>As if the large quantity of levels and options that the multiplayer game offers weren't enough, Mari0 includes a level editor that you can use to create your own levels, and what's even better is the ease of playing with those that have been created by others.<br/><br/>Mari0 is a fantastic game, a brilliant platformer that becomes even more fun when played with friends. What's more, it takes up less than five megs and is completely free. What more can you ask for?</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: ASDF</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:06:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a8/8a8a2d0dde2d7119d7948623328deda1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["SomebodyFuck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
