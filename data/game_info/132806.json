The enemies do not move, which I planned to implement, but since I didn't get around to refining the controls it really just ended up working better so you can aim. I want to keep developing on this idea and make actual levels (not just a big blank world), competent AI opponents, some actual graphics (bullets and such), and sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>I was just happy to get a working prototype done in time for the jam, hope you at least get a little amusement!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94c/94c9bd93bf1390c2c11d655b16cb230a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["atolVerderben"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
