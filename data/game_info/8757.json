{"id": 8757, "slug": "agent-awesome", "name": "Agent Awesome", "name_original": "Agent Awesome", "description": "<p>Agent Awesome is a strategy game for PC and iOS developed by Chaos Industries in 2015. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The player performs as Agent Awesome, a secret agent going through his former employer\u2019s building called E.V.I.L. (Engineering Vicious Ideas Labs). The player aims to deliver the agent from point A to point B on each of the 12 levels and get rid of every enemy on the way. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This is a third-person perspective tactical arcade. With each level, the player gets to see the floor\u2019s map.<br />\nThe screen consists of a map, a health bar, the amount of collected money and the timing line, so each level should be finished on time. The map shows the location of every enemy and their routes, so it lets the player choose his path suitable for survival and attacking. The gameplay has both combat and stealth modes. The player can mix those to fight all of the enemies and collect more money. Each point can be used for a character or a weapon upgrade and new weapon purchase. Every level is accompanied by a typical secret-agent-movie type of soundtrack and dialogues between the characters. </p>\n<h3>Reception</h3>\n<p>The game is praised for its humor and design. However, at the same time, Agent Awesome is criticized for incomplete settings and expensive weapon improvements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:48:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e20aa716bba921aece8e722215f2f6e1.jpeg", "website": "http://www.chaosindustries.com.mx", "rating": 1.84, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 30, "owned": 934, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 7}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 39, "ratings_count": 38, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 38, "platforms": ["iOS", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ashot Balasanyan", "Chaos Industries"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kiss", "Ashot Balasanyan"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
