After giving it some thought, I suggested that we make it together at after school daycare under the condition that any other kid that wants to contribute would be allowed to. She agreed, and once the permission forms were returned, we got to work.</p>\n<p>The kids drew their cats/people/fish/etc. on graph paper, which I scanned, digitally cut out, and dropped into the Unity Engine. Sprites with multiple frames required kids to use my iPad (max brightness, white screen, Guided Access on) as a lightbox to trace their pictures.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kids were loaded with great ideas (I had to explain the concept of \"feature creep\"). Fortunately, the simplicity of the core gameplay will allow fairly easy expansion of new levels, cats, possibly power-ups, and so on, so as long as the kids are up to it, the game will continue to grow and improve.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our team worked super hard on this, and I'm proud of the dedication and creativity they've shown throughout.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Hazel Stewart: Original game concept, art (inlcuding logo), voice talent</em></p>\n<p><em>Rob Derksen: Programming, project coordination</em><br/></p>\n<p><em>Aurora England: Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Ayane Zeze: Art (including title lettering), voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Brian Vu: Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Courtney \"Rose\": \u00a0Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Hayley Stewart: Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Kai T.: Art<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Kaydence V.: Art<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Lilia: Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Logan Glenn: Art<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Riya Sidhu: Art (including title art)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Wyatt Dillabough: Voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Maya T.: Art, voice talent<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>Various: Gameplay ideas/additions<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>Contact<br/></strong></p>\n<p>If you encounter any problems with running the game, please leave a comment.
