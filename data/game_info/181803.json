Help him dance his way to the top by tapping your directional keys to the rhythm of the beat. You get points for every level, but loose points for every death. You have to make it through a level before the song ends or everybody will be gone by then.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/>Stefan Zaufl: Programming, Animation<br/>Florian Spechtenhauser: Programming, Level Design<br/>David Portisch: Graphics<br/>Alex R\u00f6mich: Sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d928bba2bad6f4f9ed555bcc4dc12f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eisdrache", "Zuzek06"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
