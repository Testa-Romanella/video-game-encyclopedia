I probably would want multiplayer because that would be fun.</p>\n<p>I was bored of so many games with just moving forward. Backward. Sideways Then they call that many options of moving. I wanted a game with Karlson like movement that still had a ring of seriousness to it besides getting milk.(Milk is godlike tho)</p>\n<p>So yeah there you go.</p>\n<p>AND NO THIS IS NOT A KARLSON CLONE.
