In Gloryseeker, you play the role of a fame-stricken warrior who journeys to a battle coliseum. You choose which weapons to wield and which items to use on your quest to defeat the coliseum's champion. However, dark secrets abound, and your choices may trigger powerful yet dangerous consequences.</p>\n<p>In this game that infuses minimalist design and inferred storytelling, Gloryseeker presents a sliver of a\u00a0fantasy world within an interactive narrative. With eight achievements requiring a careful exploration of the game, Gloryseeker provides a brief yet engaging textbased experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-24T04:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d31a4e16efb0d9a9edae9f1a7a1d80f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lore of the Newts"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
