What seemed like a harmless and healthy distraction turned out to be a merciless cult that promoted itself to a regime once it took over the city. The resistance isn't what it used to be when it started out, but that's not going to stop us from trying to take back our city by taking down those evil clowns. This isn't just a game. This. Is. WARFAIR!</p>\n<p>WarFair offers players a unique experience in the world of turn-based strategy gaming. An immersive experience where information gathering through 3D audio and the use of a third-person camera is key, is our unique selling point.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T04:05:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/945a31d4fea91d275c106979b8f48443.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGAD Breda University of Applied Science"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
