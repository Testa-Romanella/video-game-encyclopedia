{"id": 94142, "slug": "mark-of-lost-royalty", "name": "Mark of Lost Royalty", "name_original": "Mark of Lost Royalty", "description": "<em> \"It all started five years ago...\"</em>\n<p>\r\n\t\tOn the same fateful night, King Lio of Rosaria and Queen Corette of Cepher disappeared. King Lio supposedly fled his country, afraid of the civil war it was fighting and afraid of getting caught in the middle. On the other hand, Queen Corette was murdered, leaving her husband King Arden and the rest of Cepher to search for the elusive culprit.</p>\n<p>Lucetta, the main character, is a girl of noble birth from Rosaria. Very much like her king, she unwillingly fled her country in order to escape the war and now stays under Cepher's protection. Over the years she has devoted her free time to looking into both incidents, especially anything regarding the disappearance of her king. After five years of staying in the foreign kingdom, she has decided that she must return home to investigate King Lio's case. With all of the other preparations in order, the last thing she needs to do is come in contact with King Arden and get his approval to move out of Cepher.</p>\n<p><strong>There is one problem, however: he plans to accuse her of killing his queen.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Characters</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Corvus: </strong>The lieutenant of Cepher's army, famous for his eyepatch exceptional skill as a swordsman and ardent devotion for his king. For some reason, he hates Volos to a severe degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Volos: </strong>The leader of Serpens, the thieves guild of Cepher. Easygoing and a bit foolish, he was one of Lucetta's first friends upon her arrival to Cepher. Allegedly, he stole something from Corvus, resulting in the other's contempt towards him.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Juna: </strong>A member of the Tigris Guild, responsible for foreign affairs. Soft spoken and tends to hide things. He is one of Corvus' acquaintances.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Arlo: </strong>A Rosarian knight who serves as Lucetta's personal guard. Not much else is known about him.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Arden: </strong>The King of Cepher. He has been looking into Corette's murder for the past five years. He knows Lucetta from when he would visit Rosaria.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Features</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Changeable Name</strong> for the MC</p>\n<p><strong>Word Count</strong> of 49,134</p>\n<p><strong>Route Demos</strong> for Corvus, Volos, Juna, and a fourth character that can be unlocked after playing at least one of the other three and selecting a <strong>specific choice </strong>in the prologue (Hint: you have to play the prologue again)</p>\n<p><strong>Custom GUI </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Image Gallery</strong>, 7 CGs in the demo and scene replay</p>\n<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Extras Page</strong>, which includes credits, developer's notes, and future plans</p>\n<p><strong><em>Post Game Questions</em></strong></p>\n<p>Questions you don't have to answer, but I'd appreciate it if you did!</p>\n<ol><li>Which character did you like the best and why?</li><li>Have you played Lost Royalty before, and if so, what did you think of this new(ish) version?</li><li>If there were to be an Ask Me Anything with me and/or the characters from this game/Vestr's Story, would you rather have it be through itch.io or through Tumblr?</li><li>How could I make things more interactive for fans of this game and Vestr's Story (ex.
