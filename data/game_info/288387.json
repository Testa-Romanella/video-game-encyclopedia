Your score is defined by the distance travelled during your run, the higher your score is, the more cars you will unlock! This mechanic put the player in a situation where he cannot just avoid other cars, he has to get close to them to maintain his speed. Our game looks like a retro racing game, cars made in pixel art, some post processing effects and synthwave musics give it an old school game style</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df6/df6dc47d3b7615671330b711528cf445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["steags"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
