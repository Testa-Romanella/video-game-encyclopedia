There's an issue with the vertical camera movement</p>\n<p>-Animation issues. Occasionally the idle jump animation will break, or the running jump animation will play for too long. This is because Unity's \"isGrounded\" function is the bane of my existence.</p>\n<p>-If you skip text too quickly then the icon doesn't always disappear.</p>\n<p>Fixing these issues isn't my top priority since ITA: Side Story is just a short side project, but if I feel like it, I may expand upon the game in the future. This game was made entirely by Paul Riggio -and I'm not the main programmer for Splee Team. They don't trust me with programming anything important. I hope you enjoy the small game I made despite that, and if you like the characters then check out the original ITA demo! Or the new one once that's done. It'll be better, I promise.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Modeling, programming, dialogue, artwork, and soundtrack was done by Paul Riggio of SpleeTeam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T07:02:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c1/0c1f45076ba04760a569edc3e0763488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SPLEE TEAM"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
