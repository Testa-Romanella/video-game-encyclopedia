You want to sing for all your undead friends...but you have no lungs. Time to build a body, so you can sing your heart out! Sing Me To Life is a point-and-click 3D adventure game, where players must follow lyrical clues and explore their graveyard home to find different body parts. Controls and Settings: The resolution should be set to 1680x1050 and\u00a0\u00a0there is no title screen or end as of yet\u00a0(recommend Alt + F4).</p>\n<p>The entire game controlled using the left mouse button. Click to move Olly the Ghost, and click on objects (or people) of interest to solve the riddles and collect body parts.</p>\n<p>I programmed the gameplay and cinematics\u00a0for this during GGJ2019, as well as co-writing the lyrics and doing a sizable amount of the design work. It's still a little rough around the edges so we'll be touching it up a bit over the next few weeks in preparation for play parties and other events.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f8e72b089debb314b976e95b96b870.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisMakesStuff", "Robyn Lawrence"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
