The scientist, with hope that he can still save his beloved creation, initiate a full system reboot in order to reset the robot\u2019s operational system to get rid of the virus. But there\u2019s a problem: the reboot takes 4 minutes to complete. Can you keep the robot\u2019s core stable long enough for him to be saved? In order to stabilize the robot you must do short tasks to fix the machinery inside the robot\u2019s head when they malfunction because of the virus. You can move with <strong>WASD</strong> and interact with <strong>F</strong>. Every time the robot says a line, a machine is broken! Malfunctioning machines will have a visual indicator that it\u2019s broken, and if the small battery next to it is shorting, you have to run to the fuse box and fix it so you can fix the machine afterwards!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:02:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f09/f09ded164b4eabd7fe25d25ebe47c394.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["carlinhu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
