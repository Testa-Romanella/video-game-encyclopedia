By applying green or blue chemical effects you start building two different DNA strands (animals: blue, plats: green). During the following two levels you can create a more complex animal or plant specimens by applying a mixture of blue and green DNA enhancing effects (!<em> Only one effect application per level is allowed</em>).   </p>\r\nGame Rules: \r\n  \r\n\r\nGoal\r\n  \r\n<p>The goal of the game is to advance as many animal or plant organisms to earn the highest score.</p>\r\nEvolution:\r\n<ul><li><em>Animals</em></li></ul>\n<p>You can advance a blue animal organism by applying blue DNA effect to keep its genetic material pure.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You can advance blue animal organism by applying green DNA effect to make it a \u201cnew\u201d blue-green and more complex organism.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But you kill \u201cnew\u201c blue-green animal organism by applying old blue DNA effect, therefore, stunting its development process.</p>\n<ul><li><em>Plants</em></li></ul>\n<p>You can advance a green plant organism by applying green DNA effect to keep its genetic material pure.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You can advance green plant organism by applying blue DNA effect to make it a \u201cnew\u201d green-blue and more complex organism.\r\n  </p>\n<p>But you kill \u201cnew\u201c green-blue plant organism by applying old green DNA effect, therefore, stunting its development process.</p>\r\nDNA effects\r\n<ul><li>Red square always kills.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Blue square either advances or kills depending on the rules mentioned above.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Green square either advances or kills depending on the rules mentioned above.
