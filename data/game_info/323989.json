Good news: they liked your application, but now they want you to prove your dedication by going on a little trip around the universe and documenting the things that you've learned.</p>\n<p>The Hobo's Handbook, aside from being a blatant reference to a certain book series by Douglas Adams, is actually an idea that I've had for a while now, but just hadn't gotten around to committing to. When\u00a0I found out about\u00a0GameDevNetwork's Book Jam, I\u00a0decided to use it as an excuse to sit down and develop my universe, which is perhaps best described as a romanticized parody of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.\u00a0The game itself is written in Twine 1.4.2. It's more writing than it is an actual game, but I\u00a0hope you enjoy it nonetheless!</p>\n<p>~\u00a0Cratmang\u00a0</p>\n<p>(P.S.: I am on twitter.
