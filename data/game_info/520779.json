You are sent to a town to defeat enemies and a creature that lies in the deep cave.</p>\n<p>In this topdown 2D adventure game you will be able to fight with enemies, interact with NPC's and dash your way through the level! You can play with the controller while in game, but the menu navigation doesn't work, still need to fix it!</p>\n<p>This is made as a demo for the official launch, which will come in the future! Lots of new stuff to be added still, like a map system, a mission system, more movement...! Hope you enjoy and share if you like it! Thanks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T04:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b4/0b4c2b60a81a8e1115dfc658ac35bc86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jo\u00e3o Cavacos"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
