Black cells are walls. The green cell is the starting point and the red cell is the finishing point.<br/>The explorer only knows the rooms he has been before. He can't see the exit and he can't see rooms that he has never been into.<br/>The explorer tries to find the exit in the fewest moves possible, given that he has no clue where to search first.</p>\n<p>Basic exploration algorithm:<br/>1. Search adjacent cells for the first empty cell<br/>2. If found, move there and place the direction of the movement made to the new cell<br/>3. Otherwise, move to the opposite of the current cell direction (backtracking)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T06:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98e/98e6debee7301683dfd24401cf8d61da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pantsik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
