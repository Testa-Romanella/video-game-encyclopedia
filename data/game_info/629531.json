I decided to go with somewhat close to LGBT+ colors for my rainbow.</p>\n<p>rus - red, orange,\u00a0yellow, green, light blue, blue, indigo</p>\n<p>eng -\u00a0red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet</p>\n\n<p>~~~ What I used ~~~</p>\n<p>- Unity</p>\n<p>- Aseprite</p>\n<p>no third party code or assets were used.</p>\n\n<p>If you are bored and have nothing better to do, check out my Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1sKui9gwUQ0VxXMoxhnqY3?si=KwyCjN1sQuq3fp-QHwhtnw&amp;...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:03:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f93c7a2e46efc936c7932f3b8cbe27a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["J28.14"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
