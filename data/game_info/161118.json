I guess It's better this way then, this game is not about dying bazillion times.\u00a0<br/><br/>I'm sorry about the lame theme approach but, as a first game, I had to learn how to use my tools and It took me about half the time I had to make a game. Better work next time I hope.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>PS : Stay a while in game after the \"End\" to see credits.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Kind regards,\u00a0<br/>M.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b44/b44bb24883f8ad785bc99019465dc2d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marcellus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
