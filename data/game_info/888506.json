The kitten can ride a boat sometimes. When you try to buy from the shop there's a random chance something bad happens. The boat is hard to control precisely. There is an enemy (jellyfish) who appears when the timer runs out and tries to get you. There is island gameplay and boat gameplay. The goal is only to get money and buy expensive items.<br/></p><p>Made for Sylvie's Jam #1</p>\n<p>Arrows - move<br/>Up Arrow / Space - jump<br/>Alt+F4 - quit<br/>All interactions are done by jumping</p>\n<p>Music - Kernherbst<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds - from freesound.org under Creative Commons 0</p>\n<p>No ending is implemented yet, sorry.
