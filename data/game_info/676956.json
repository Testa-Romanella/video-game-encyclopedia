Your goal is to collect Lucky Cats. Unfortunately, samurai have come to kill you. Luckily, you have a grappling hook to destroy the samurai and help you collect the cats. Holding left click will allow you to pull yourself towards an object. Right click will allow you to swing and slow your momentum down. Buildings and bamboo will provide plenty of the things to grapple onto. There are different types of tasks to get Lucky Cats, like killing samurai, racing against the clock, climbing bamboo, and searching for hidden Cats. However, each task has a time limit, and if you fail, you lose points. You can move with WASD and jump with SPACE. Good luck, young ninja.</p>\n<p>Credits-</p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Liam Healey- Programming Lead</li><li>Ian Ceron- Programming\u00a0</li><li>Mabel Reed-\u00a0Programming\u00a0</li><li>Zach McCarthy- Programming\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Artists:</p>\n<ul><li>Drew Abegg- Art Lead\u00a0</li><li>Elias Dodd- 3D Artist and Animator\u00a0</li><li>Miles Holt- 3D Artist and Concept Artist\u00a0</li><li>Jacques Plante- 3D Artist\u00a0</li><li>Conlen Breheny- FX Artist\u00a0</li><li>Kara Howard- Concept Artist, UI Artist\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Designers:</p>\n<ul><li>Liam Healey- Design Lead\u00a0</li><li>Joceyln Deslauriers- Designer\u00a0</li><li>Elias Dodd- Designer</li></ul>\n<p>Sound:</p>\n<ul><li>Mabel Reed- Music, Sound Effects</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acb/acb0f147e786d23cb9c1424bfbd2f43f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Drew Abegg"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
