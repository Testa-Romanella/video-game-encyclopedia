The attack tank improves upon the original charge \n      shot with the ultimate weapon--the super charge shot. It cuts a swath of \n      devastation through any armor. The defense tank features a shield that \n      bounces back any attack.\n    </p><p>\n      The hostiles have added new weapons like wave shots, scatter shots, \n      lasers, and drills. Hover units unaffected by the terrain and a cloaking \n      stealth system have also been added. Gargantuan tanks have also joined \n      the enemy's forces. The original's weapon systems are back too, like \n      ricochet, homing, and mortar-type shots.\n    </p><p>\n      There are 90 stages in all (60 regular and 30 bonus stages)--20 more \n      than the previous game. Strap yourself in and gear up for an intense, \n      futuristic tank shooting war--the original was only the beginning.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b00/b00952f552a527da97f7354f51c2b744.jpg", "website": "http://www.agetec.com/Nintendo3DS/tbt2.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Agetec"], "esrb_rating": null}
