{"id": 709167, "slug": "block-line-engineer", "name": "Block Line Engineer", "name_original": "Block Line Engineer", "description": "Block Line Engineer is a physics based sandbox automation simulation game where you build machines from basic parts like motors, rotating joints and connector plates. Once your machine is done you teach it how to move and maybe combine it with a different machine to form a block line. Block lines are moving blocks to block receivers. Optimize your block lines to achieve maximum throughput.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> <strong>Realistic Physics</strong><br/>Both machines and blocks are simulated in a way that mimics real life physics. Machines need to be driven by motors. Links with many parts attached are heavier. Weight needs to be taken into consideration when choosing the right motor (choose too small of a motor and you end up with a slow moving, overloaded machine.)<br/></li><li> <strong>Easy click and place machine building</strong><br/>Just click on whatever part you want to add and the game will show you were that part can be attached.<br/></li><li> <strong>Simple machine teaching</strong><br/>Just drag the link you want to move to where you want it to be and add a move command. Open or close the gripper and add a grip command. Play back your command chain to see your machine move through all the poses you defined (and hopefully do something useful along the way.)<br/><br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Unlimited possibilities</strong><br/>Want to create a machine with 6 independent arms? No problem. How about a machine with 2 Grippers working in tandem? Go right ahead. Want to activate a machine when another machine reaches the end of it's command chain? We've got that covered.<br/></li><li> <strong>10 challenging levels</strong><br/>Figured out a machine configuration that works great in the first level? Neat. You might need to rethink your approach in the next level though. Each level poses a unique challenge and there's no one machine design to rule them all.<br/></li><li> <strong>Detailed in game help</strong><br/>Being a Block Line Engineer is no walk in the park. Building, teaching and optimizing machines is complex work. But do not worry, for you are given The Block Line Engineer's handbook; An in game guide that covers everything from blueprint creation to machine disassembly.<br/><br/><br/></li><li> <strong>Blueprints</strong><br/>Proud of your newest design and looking for a way to reuse it quickly in other levels? Blueprints are the way to go. Drop your machine on a blueprint slot to make it easily reusable.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T04:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95c/95c43ed707773c3fbb9d2a3beb9f9cfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ElectronDust"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ElectronDust"], "esrb_rating": null}
