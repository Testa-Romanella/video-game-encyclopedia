{"id": 395695, "slug": "crosps", "name": "Crosps", "name_original": "Crosps", "description": "<p>Crosps stemmed from the idea of \"What is the least effective way of defending your farm from wasps?\" after my friend slapped a wasp out of mid air. After a solid hour of  laughing too hard at a farmer running into a field with 2 hand guns blindly shooting, I wanted to make a game. Change \"Dual Wielding Hand Guns\" to \"Stupidly Old Sniper\" and this game was born.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crosps is Duck Hunt meets pain.</strong></p>\n<p>With stupidly small wasps, and a cross hair filling the screen, precision and patience are a must have. And by God, you must have a lot of time to spare - although a simple concept, shooting the stupid wasps out of the air is bloody well impossible.</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"If you aren't already suicidal, DON'T play this game - 6/5\"</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>- Cameron Showell, Professional Robloxer</em></p>\n<p>Featuring a (soon to be) Story Mode, a Challenge Mode to snap your brain in half, and a stupidly infinite Endless Mode that if you play long enough you will fill your screen with wasps.</p>\n<p><strong><em>\"5 Stars, Very addicting, but Impossibly difficult\"</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>-Thomas McNulty, Car Boi</em></p>\n<p>So GO! Play now! Shoot those wasps! Loose your life to me! It's all worth it in the end....</p>\n<p>\"I rate it 10/10 for fun and 1000000/10 for me wanting to die\"</p>\n<p><em>-Joe Earp</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faf/faf2916adc9fa75e2c12bba458668282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blue Hood Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
