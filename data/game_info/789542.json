It took me quite a long to make considering it was originally planned to be part of the NaNoRenO22. Nevertheless I'm happy with the end result.</p>\n<p>I hope you like this game, but even if you don't, I hope it at least entertained you for a while, and maybe it made you consider checking Fauna and other Hololive members channels.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Instructions:</em><br/></p>\n<p>Extract all the files to a folder and Run the EXE file.</p>\n\n<p><strong>*Important*</strong></p>\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with Fauna's lore, I'd advise you to watch these two videos:</p>\n<p>Video1: Fauna's Halloween ASMR</p>\n\n\n<p>This video is what basically inspired this novel. It's really good as a standalone ASMR and it's full of Lore.</p>\n<p>Video2: Nemu's introduction video</p>\n\n<p>In this video we are introduced to Nemu, Fauna's friend and companion. There's not\u00a0 much lore about her but I find the idea presented on this introduction video very intriguing and that's why you see her in the game.</p>\n\n<p><em>Disclamer:</em><br/></p>\n<p>This is a Fangame, I can't and won't accept any donation nor money from it. All characters and lore are owned by Hololive/Cover\u00a0Corp. This game is a creative but unofficial take on them.</p>\n\n<p><em>Licenses:</em></p>\n<p>The game uses sounds, music, voice, and many assets I bought over time. Most of them are often found in Humble Bundle and Fanatical. If you have any inquiry about the License status there's a credits zip included there. If you recognize your assets and have a concern please let me know.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T22:41:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d7/2d7ebba80fa00f269237309d6293dc6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["N30HRTGDV"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
