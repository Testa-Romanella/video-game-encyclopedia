The condition for customs clearance is to click the block with the mouse to turn it over. When the images of the two blocks turned out are different, they will automatically return to their original positions, otherwise they will not return to their original positions. So you need to remember the avatar of the block, and when all the blocks are turned over successfully, you can pass the level and get gold coins. Each level is set with the number of times that can be turned over. When the number of times is exhausted and all the blocks have not been turned over, the game fails. The further the level is, the fewer times you can turn it over, and the more blocks and gold coins you need to turn over.<h3>Colorful cg illustrations</h3>The illustrations are full of beautiful girly images, whether you like black silk, sprites with pointed ears, or uniforms to play, you can find them in this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T03:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0e/a0eec5224b23c683990934f88829baad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 307, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Origin team"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Origin team"], "esrb_rating": null}
