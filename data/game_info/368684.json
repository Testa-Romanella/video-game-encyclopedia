The webgl version is a bit slow.</strong><br/></p><p>Enter a noir-inspired world as dark and as evil as your small intestine. Emily Coli, a bacterium on the run,\u00a0has a train to catch. The body she rode into seven days ago (on a nice caeser salad)\u00a0has gone to seed,\u00a0 and she's on her way to the stomach to get out before it's too late. She will face\u00a0pools of gastric acid, trigger-happy white blood cells, and... her past: P.I. Luke O'cyte, an immune-compromised former cop\u00a0 and former lover.</p>\n<p>Platforming puzzles revolve around\u00a0Emily's ability to split via mitosis. Her clones mirror her movement, which helps her short-circuit neurons to open doors, but may also get in her way.</p>\n<p>Created for August's PIGSquad summer game jam with the themes \"Edutainment\" and \"Ancient History\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a8/9a862083a6017d262b09a7110bd06053.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jonapulse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
