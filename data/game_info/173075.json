In Easy mode, you are allowed to continue controlling the piece after the landing. You decide when a new piece is created. Hard mode is like the Tetris you know, a new piece is created once your piece touches the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Press Z and X (or up-down) buttons to rotate the pieces. <br/></p>\n<p>M to mute/unmute the music.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Development story</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I swear that I had its idea in 2008. Neither I knew programming good enough, nor it was easy to make a physics based game at that time like now. I have seen that there are games like Not Tetris 2 and Tricky Towers, but I think the easy mode in this game is unique.<br/><br/><strong>Musics<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I got permission from Talha Kaya to use his music, \u00c7ubuklar, in this game. It's a great piece from his album, Small Games. <strong>https://talhakaya.bandcamp.com/album/small-games </strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/ecc85f2dcbc73b80ecf2f7ee40bd9b29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
