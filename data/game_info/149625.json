But stronger cubes cannot fuse with weaker ones, they destroy them instead!\u00a0</p>\n<p>So splitting your cubes into weaker ones and clever movement are necessary to beat the tight time limits or the other player\u2026 Do you have what it takes to become a combiner?</p>\n<p>Enjoyed this game?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let us know on:\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/combiner42</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/945/945f104fa26891630121f9fc4aafbd4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["slowpokes.art"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
