If you ask me, it was a bit lacking in the sound department, so, using FMOD, Ableton, Microphones and my favourite soundbanks, I redesigned the sounds from the ground up in the game engine.</p>\n<p>This time, I mostly wanted to work on creating the most oppressive atmosphere through audio elements, so there's no music at all, just layers and layers of interactive sounds that create a sonic hellscape.</p>\n<p>I'm fully available for collabs so DM me any time !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T12:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/218/2180e2b0518c4b4fa60b0a30a1de41f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peter Wojtek"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
