{"id": 391881, "slug": "do-squids-have-hearts", "name": "Do Squids Have Hearts?", "name_original": "Do Squids Have Hearts?", "description": "<p>\"Do Squids Have Hearts\" is a game about escaping a massive, scary shark, as a tiny, slow squid called Shinzo. But of course, life isn't that easy. The sea is also littered with naval mines, bubble streams and traditional Chinese fishermen (these guys really like squid). Oh, and if avoiding all of that is too easy, don't forget you also have to get the shark to eat mines, without hitting them yourself!<br/><br/>It's truly a dangerous game under the sea, but one question remains unanswered.<br/>Does Shinzo have a heart?<br/><br/>This game was made in a week by TonyStr.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e6/0e60087c04b55f335336a01a39436db9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TonyStr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
