The game is made in C# with Unity.\u00a0 For my part, I realized all the drawings, the screens and the interface. I also modified the player's movement system initially created to use the New Input System and to add the different sounds and musics of the game, which I sometimes remixed.\u00a0 I hope you'll like the game and don't hesitate to visit the credits to get our contact information!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T15:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2ad8dd6ba0b453d07590ba9bf24677ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Firrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
