Your job is to destroy as many enemy ships as you can while surviving the storm of bullets. If you stop for long, you will die!\u00a0</p><p>It is important to aim for the target on each ship. There are clear visual indicators for the HP on all ships, and the ammunition on your own. Each time you destroy an enemy, you gain 30 bullets (up to the max).<br/></p><p>Controls are WASD/Arrow Keys for movement, and left Ctrl or left button for shooting.</p><p>- - - - - - - -</p><p>I used sound effects I own from GlitchMachines (https://glitchmachines.com/). The background is from a photograph I took years back to replace a video that won't display with WebGL. All other assets were created by me for this jam.
