Down the well und up again is about a brave little Knight who one day decided to jump down the well out of curiosity. Now you got to help him get back up again!\u00a0</p>\n<p>My original goal was to generate the levels each time you play. For that I tried out an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. But generating playable levels proved difficult especially with such a short time window. What's in the game is one of the generated level structures but heavily modified to look better and be actually playable.</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun trying it out. I did an all nighter to actually have some gameplay ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T03:20:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/905/905aa1dd962b4befe1958b5dddef854a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yorschor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
