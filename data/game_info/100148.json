The rose's glass shell can only withstand a limited amount of damage. It's up to the prince to keep her safe from an influx of wild sheep and an overgrowth of baobab trees, which weakens the rose's roots.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0Kick, grab, and throw incoming wild sheep into the nearest volcano.
