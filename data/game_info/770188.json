Many shops will contain gadgets and tools for the player to use during their heists, which can be used as distractions or ways to trip pursuers. <br/><br/>A STORY-DRIVEN NARRATIVE FILLED WITH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS!<br/><br/>The narrative in 'Thieves' Paradise' is presented in a visual novel style. where the player will speak to one of three characters depending on the story they are presently on.

In addition to the visual novel segments 'Thieves' Paradise', the gameplay sections contain Radio Messages, which feature a character speaking directly to the Thief during their heists.

And it is up to the player to decide just how to go about accomplishing this.
