Different types of blocks are introduced over time; some are affected by gravity, some can't be destroyed, and some destroy the ball or make it bounce.</p><p>Press \"R\" to restart and Esc to return to the menu during any of the levels, or use the buttons in the scene. There is a specific order to the levels, but feel free to skip a level if you get stuck on it for too long. This is my first full puzzle game, so the difficulty balancing isn't great. There are multiple solutions for most of the levels, so feel free to play around and find unintended ways of completing the game.</p><p>There are particle effects in the game when you break blocks or complete a level, but if they don't work when you first open the game, go into the settings menu and disable then reenable the checkbox labeled \"Play Particle Effects\"</p><p>Let me know how you found it in the comments, or report any bugs or issues you found.\u00a0 Unfortunately there are a few minor bugs in the online version of the game, but it's still completely playable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T10:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9b/b9b768cdc2c93d344d7a71f0c1a92fa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NoahRobinson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
