This is my second game Jam. My game is about a world of chickens and the stealing of their eggs. You have to tape the feathers you find on to yourself to be able to be part chicken and be partially\u00a0<strong>connected</strong> to the chickens by wearing part of them. The feathers you wear / are <strong>connected </strong>to give you jumpiness and floatiness. Hope you enjoy my game!</p>\n<p><strong>Why does the ui look off?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Welcome to unity webgl its garbage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b98b489c2e8041765db3319dfb580311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["c0d3d"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
