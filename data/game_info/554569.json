I did all the coding/level design. Music from OpenGameArt. 2D Assets by MochiFishi. This game is pretty simple, just run and jump to the portal. There are only 3 levels.\u00a0 There are a couple of jump pads to help you with the levels. Use Left/Right Arrow Keys to move and Spacebar to Jump. You have infinite lives, the game will just restart the level if you die. Also if you get stuck, press \"R\" to reload. Thanks!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:21:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c6026519fb09b430e563590f8005ce7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["teamM.E.G"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
