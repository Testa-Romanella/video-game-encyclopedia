Put your skills to the test and let your creativity flow inside this paint booth simulator. Featuring realistic spray gun behavior that simulates a real world spraying pattern. Choose from multiple vehicles, including cars, concept vehicles and a plane. You can choose from either a paint gun, airbrush, or aerosol spray type, with the simplified controls you only require one controller. The side grip button will toggle your spray device, the trigger will spray, and and the touchpad will teleport. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe realistic spraying patterns can be controlled similarly to a real paint gun using pressure sensitivity. The further the trigger is pressed, the more paint will be applied.
