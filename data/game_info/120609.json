Critique is very appreciated!--Synopsis--A game about relationships and whether they are worth the effort or not. Also some Norse stuff thrown in because why the fudgy fudge fudge not. The game is primarily a walking simulator but there are a few video games. It is very voice acting heavy so if you can't handle my voice, then welcome to the club.--Known Issues--<p>-Some mini games may glitches such as allowing the player to fall out of a map or to fall into a pit that the player may perceive as a death pit. There is no death in the game though so you are always safe and should always be able to progress.</p>--Controls--<p>Movement: WASD</p><p>Look Around: Mouse</p><p>Interact: E</p><p>Pause Game: Escape</p>--Contact Me--<p>If you have any questions or would like to collaborate feel free to email me at:</p><p>Email: nichoreynolds@gmail.com</p><p>While I don't quite get it just yet, I occasionally tweet at:</p><p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/NichReynolds<br/></p><p>If you would like to check out any postmortems or personal project updates you can find them here at my blog:</p><p>Blog: https://touchmyhapticfeedback.wordpress.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/6884718b72664b9bea57dae6be9c02f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NicholasReynolds"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
