Based on student research of how holistic medicine lifts moods, this game gives the player reign to explore and learn about various ways holistic medicine can be used. Made for a\u00a0student contest.</p>\n<p><em>Note: While researching the topic of holistic medicine, I realized that this topic had a lot of depth. Because of that, patient experiences should be taken as generalizations, rather than something that should be directly interpreted.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong></p>\n<p>MUSIC:</p>\n<p>\"Misty Mornings\" - DJ Quads -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusFqutyfTWRqGhC8kHA5uw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f46/f46bb3ff8a678bf81a547b8e9f48e474.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cnnmon"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
