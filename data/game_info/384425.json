Kill all the enemies in each room to progress, and collect points to unlock secrets!<br/></p>\n<p>This is a demo that has 20 stages.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- Raccoons!<br/>- Treasure!<br/>- Local multiplayer!</p>\n<p>The demo is free, but you can support me by donating! Help me attend shows! Ideally the full game will have 100 levels and a sweet boss fight at the end.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>For the best experience, I recommend you use gamepads to play this!</strong></p>\n<p>No gamepads? No problem! Download the keyboard version instead. :)\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T06:45:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc0/fc0ab8d5aa872b8692e954763615eb9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marsbarnigiri"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
