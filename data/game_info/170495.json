In this game you are an evil creature living in a cave. Some explorers want to take pictures of you but you can't allow it. That's why you are going to kill them all before get out of the cave.<p>Some mechanics include hitting someone, throwing its body on other explorers or creating a shock wave that will make stalactites fall. The game is a mix of reflection and good timing. There are 14 levels. I wish I had time to make more but I had no time.</p><p>The game was created using C++ and the SFML library.</p><p>Results (among 1198 participants) :</p><p>#108 Fun 3.66<br/>#155 Overall 3.62<br/>#172 Innovation 3.50<br/>#188 Theme 3.83<br/>#259 Mood 3.30<br/>#330 Humor 3.00<br/>#412 Audio 2.85<br/>#475 Graphics 3.07</p><p>Link to the game in the LD website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa78d9b6a20e2e0b10302a6fdc89dd9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Quetzakol"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
