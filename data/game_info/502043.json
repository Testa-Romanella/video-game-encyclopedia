Since the deadline for the game to be submitted has passed for my class I won't be editing it until after it's been graded so please download one of the builds if you can't get past the intro bit.<br/><br/>Best experienced on Windows in full screen.<br/>( Android is second best )<br/></strong>Created within a week for NYU Game Center's Major Studio Fall 2020 class.<br/>The theme for that week was Virtual Pet.</p>\n<p>Note: Mac and WebGL builds do not have Text to Speech because it wasn't supported for those platforms :')<br/><br/>Use your mouse to feed and pet your cat. Figure out where your cat likes to be pet and how much food it likes to be fed.</p>\n<p>Sound effects were taken from NYU Game Center's Audio Library. <br/>BGM is a version of nyan cat I edited for funsies.\u00a0<br/>Plugin used for text to speech was from here.<br/><br/>If you would like to see what the game is like with text to speech ( although it's a tad buggy) you can see that here.</p>\n<p>One last small note I'd like to make about this game is behind the reasoning of the very detailed pronoun/name system. I was talking to one of my friends about how I wish I could do the thing where you go to Starbucks to try out a new name to see if you like how it sounds, but since COVID times are still upon us I was determined to find a way to do that with this game using text to speech.<br/> I didn't want to make this useful for just myself, so I tried my best to add as many options as possible for people to use.\u00a0 I know this doesn't entirely tie into the prompt, but I like to try to have fun \u00a0and learn something new\u00a0with my homework assignments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T07:22:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3feee5fae2a58f41d874ee5897cd64c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["gensuta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
