The theme for the fifth week was 'Cats'. Which meant that we could choose any game idea we desired, however it must involve \u00a0cats in one way or another. I chose to create a cat and mouse game where the aim of the game is to catch as many mice as possible before the timer runs out. There are some unfinished elements, such as the npc cats and inventory system, however i may continue working on it in the near future.</p>\n<p>Download the game and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Also check out my other games on my profile!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T04:20:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad6/ad67508e0a8668d6f7331755748148d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jacob Lister"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
