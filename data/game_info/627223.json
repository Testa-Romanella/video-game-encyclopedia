I didn't use any kind of game engines, so it was kind of hard to develop it (That's the reason it's too short), and I had so many problems, specially talking about <strong>performance </strong>between different devices.</p>\n<p>The project consists of <strong>4 files</strong>, 1 is music (composed by me), other 2 are sound effects, and the last one is the game itself.</p>\n<p>All the graphics<em> (except the opening and ending image, wich are stored inside the Javascript\u00a0as a BASE64 url, that stores the files in text strings)</em> are stored as <strong>Javascript functions</strong>, that draw pixels at certain positions, subtracting the <strong>camerax </strong>and <strong>cameray </strong>for giving the illusion of <strong>scrolling</strong>. The functions that draw pixels are called by the <strong><em>TILE DRAWING</em></strong> functions, that draw tiles formed of those pixels, that can also be mirrored horizontally and vertically.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>two </strong>drawing layers in the game, the <strong><em>BACKGROUND </em></strong>layer, and the <strong><em>ENGINEOBJECTS </em></strong>layer.</p>\n<p>I needed to use a lot <strong><em>MATH </em></strong>in this project, for example, in the ghosts room, i used <strong>sines </strong>and <strong>cosines </strong>for calculating the movement needed to reach <strong>BANIO</strong>. Math is also used in the mirroring of players.</p>\n<p>If you want to <strong><em>take a look at the code</em></strong>, you can download the<strong><em> ZIP file</em></strong> down there with the code (HTML with Javascript in a <strong>&lt;script&gt;</strong> tag inside) available to you.</p>\n<p>ENJOY THE GAME!!</p>\n<p><em>-JMIDEV, the developer/artist/composer of the game.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T10:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e1/0e1732e1190df1467e7499faad8a4296.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["JMIDEV"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
