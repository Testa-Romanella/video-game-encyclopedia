You can use pure, weak elements at range or combine them to deal higher damage at closer range, but only against an opposite type! You play as a scientist reclaiming his lab from an experiment which has gone wrong, causing the elemental beasts to appear and take control of the lab.\r\nUse your combat timing as well as quick reaction skills to switch elements on the fly and avoid damage, while taking out your enemies!\r\nThis game was made in 7 days for the 5th Brackey's Game Jam.
