In case of having a low level of tolerance,  the scientist does not know the risks posed by the work to be undertaken. One morning Gordon was sent to a test chamber to perform a standard analysis of the crystal. The consequences of the experiment, however, are catastrophic.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature of the Half-Life gameplay is the continuous interaction of the player with the environment. For example, the player can move the box to the desired height. On the base of interactivity were built a lot of puzzles that may require the player&#39;s ingenuity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-13T17:03:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d54/d54f0267a042f44c032d8ca264584ecf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.73, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 272, "owned": 4768, "beaten": 418, "toplay": 23, "dropped": 147, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 537, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 541, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Valve Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Valve"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
