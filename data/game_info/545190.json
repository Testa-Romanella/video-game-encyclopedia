I want to start the project off with simple interaction such as moving the player around the room then adapt this to have shooting basic objects in a room, if I can succeed at movement and shooting I will implement more features for the game! I have included a GUI to show camera FOV, Speed, frame rate with a graph and buttons to play Audio.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T03:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ccb/ccb9c624d788ffcb7a52b052cb7017c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheDoritoDom"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
