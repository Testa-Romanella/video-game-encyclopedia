{"id": 47307, "slug": "slide", "name": "Slide!!", "name_original": "Slide!!", "description": "Slide!! is a puzzle game. All you have to do is slide each block (or \"Slider\") on to the appropriate goal square. However, once you start a Slider moving, it will not stop unless it hits something (either a wall or another Slider). The game comprises 10 Tutorial levels that teach you how to play, then there are 25 Easy, 25 Medium, 25 Hard and 15 Bonus levels. In order to unlock levels you must earn stars. You earn one star for solving the puzzle, a second star for solving within a certain time limit, and a third star for doing so in the target number of moves (or fewer). Even if you earn three stars on all levels, you can re-play to try and beat your personal best. The question is: what happens if you 3-star all levels?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef3612e4cc7d7a236f88231d4d96c14.jpg", "website": "http://www.redchaingames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 15}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Red Chain Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Chain Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
