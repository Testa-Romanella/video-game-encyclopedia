It's a relaxing multiplayer online game where everyone plays a deer. Instead of chatting, questing or killing, people play with each other creatively in a virtual forest filled with magical surprises. The current version of the game has been going strong for 10 years with 170,000 registered players but we haven't been able to expand it because its technology is outdated. Now we want to continue the endless growth that we have always envisioned for this project .</p><p><strong>We are currently fundraising to keep the game, free and online, updating it to a new game engine so performance is better and making expansions and updates possible. </strong>See our IndieGoGo campaign at: http://igg.me/at/theendlessforest and BACK IT there or choose to give here at itch.io with a donation as you download the game.</p><p>You can download this game completely free at our website. This version is purely for people who want to give a donation when they download. The money goes to keep the server online.</p><p>Thank you and See you in The Forest!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0f1d59831490493af8ab20b632cff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 257, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tale of Tales"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
