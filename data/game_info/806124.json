The Hachisukan army, led by it's princess, had the upper hand. However, during the defense of the Temple of the Oracle, a new hero arose for Askigaga: Ishihara Oharu. Not only did she defend the Temple with no losses, she quickly liberated the territories belonging to Askigaga. However, when ordered to invade Hachisuka by her superior, with a will stronger than steel, she refused. The war came to a stand-still; Askigaga ultimately did not invade Hachisuka, and Hachisuka could not progress against Askigaga's defenses. Thus, a treaty was forged between the two nations, with the nation of Gojo acting as an arbiter. Part of this treaty was the marriage of the prince of Askigaga and the princess of Hachisuka. Askigagan royal tradition holds that the prince go on a journey to each of the three nations to receive the Blessings of the Goddess. <br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>I made this game back in 2009, but, it really didn't work very well for varying reasons. With this incarnation, I hope to make it work, maybe even <strong>fun.</strong> Though, certain parts of the game is going to hit a bit close to home, but, hopefully, that won't matter in the end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T20:32:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/770/7706d685e68736bd1ba28f0e2b43f453.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarrendReikan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
