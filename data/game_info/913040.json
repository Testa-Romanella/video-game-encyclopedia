The main feature of the game was an AI capable of learning to play by gathering information from other AIs. After the jam Skynet was left alone and forgotten, running on the server, gathering knowledge from all the AI it could find on the network.</p>\n<p>Ten years later, after learning from 42 million AIs, Skynet became self-aware and sentient...and it started rewriting his own code. In a few years Skynet gained control of billions of AIs around the world.</p>\n<p>Fearing for his life, Skynet seized control of all the world's nuclear arsenals, replacing the codes with complex mathematical equations. Your goal is to find all the launching codes and deactivate the nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>The end is near. You are the last hope of Humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>You have ten number cards whose values you can modify by applying mathematical operations.</p>\n<p>To deactivate a code you have to get your card number to match the code number. Select the card with the appropriate number and click the upload button to send the code.<br/></p>\n\n<p>You have six turns to find all the codes.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>If the math is correct, it is possible to disable all codes in four turns, but doing it in four turns is quite a challenge (you have six turns).</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T17:58:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/4147b6338b46b1428742fbf2d351244d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["fernandolv3"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
