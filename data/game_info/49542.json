{"id": 49542, "slug": "depopulation", "name": "Depopulation", "name_original": "Depopulation", "description": "The world\u2019s pollution is threatening all life on Earth. Employed by a Billionaire, and chosen for your high intelligence and psychopathic tendencies, it\u2019s up to you to save the world by any means necessary. On surface Depopulation is a military strategy game glorifying casualties, but underneath is a deeply emotional, philosophical roller coaster, that will help you understand our unbreakable connection with the environment. It hopes to portray the terrible cost of ignoring that connection.<br/><br/>Use invasions, hunger, disease, nukes, amplifying natural disasters and civil wars to dramatically cull the most adaptable and clever animal on the planet. Or try a peaceful but harder approach. Use clever politics, convince countries to join you, build environmental wonders, construct environmental infrastructure and reduce the birth-rate to create a sustainable future. Either way, the only thing that matters is the survival of Earth\u2019s environment, for which even billions lives is a small price to pay.<br/><br/><ul><li> Free WebAssembly version!

Yes! Especially if you want to support the author.

It's seriously, only $5 US so why not?
