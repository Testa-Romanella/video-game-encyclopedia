In chapter 2456, mention is made of a small piece of land where men will NEVER have the right to settle under penalty of being punished by the Gods themselves. You, Mayor, have definitely not read this chapter because you decided to set up your village there. . . What a pity! The Gods were furious and therefore cursed you : You who love to play with fire, the Gods have given you a nice deck of cards. On these cards are written all kinds of possible reactions, sometimes very nice, sometimes odious. Every time you interact with someone, you will have to take two cards and choose the one you want. <br/></p>\n\n<p>You will have to gather votes in anticipation of the upcoming elections. Elections are held when you only have two cards left<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow keys to move\u00a0<br/>E to interact\u00a0<br/>mouse to select an option</p>\n<p>This game has been made during the GMTK Game Jam 2020.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e9d2566e544f200e58d8b82dd6a6ae0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Pino Paprika", "Beli Bulbe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
