{"id": 826104, "slug": "wayward-suns", "name": "Wayward Suns", "name_original": "Wayward Suns", "description": "<p><strong>Wayward Suns</strong> is a sci-fi TTRPG about your plucky crew of Spacers\u2014misfits, vagabonds, and ne'er-do wells roaming the stars\u2014and how they changed the galaxy, or died trying.<br/><br/>Some few hundred years after\u00a0the Shattering, a galactic conflict that razed worlds and sent civilization reeling centuries backwards, the galaxy is beginning to start its forward march once again. As long-isolated pockets of the galaxy become reconnected, a veritable gold-rush has begun around the edges of the ALR network. You and your crew are at the forefront of this rush, looking for money, truth, long-lost knowledge, or refuge from whatever lurks behind you.<br/><br/>Wayward Suns is inspired by wide swaths of the science-fiction genre, from space operas to science fantasy. Tough-as-nails veterans mix ranks with mutants, exotic and inhuman aliens, and esoteric wielders of space-warping psychic powers. Normalcy is for core-folks, after all.<br/><br/>Wayward Suns offers deep, classless character building where players build unique skillsets from a massive variety of skills, traits, and character complications. With 14 playable species and a wealth of character options, it's almost difficult to make two characters feel the same.<br/><br/><strong>Future updates will include:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Ground and space vehicle combat</li><li>Rules for founding your own outpost</li><li>More art!</li><li>Filling out all those \"FLUFF\" boxes where flavor text goes</li><li>A GM guide</li><li>Periodic lore updates and releases</li></ul>\n<p><strong>While in early development, Wayward Suns is completely free!
