It can be played from start to finish, but still needs updated CGs, sprites, GUI and editing before it's considered whole.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<p>- Sometimes you will go to work instead of what you're supposed to do</p>\n<p>- Some voice acting is missing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Creed sometimes misses the place he's supposed to be in one on one time</p>\n<p>- The king and queen are placeholder sprites and they don't allign properly. Their mouths don't move either. That scene is just a mess lol</p>\n<p>- In scenes done nearer to the end, the lines aren't paced.</p>\n<p>- Some of the GUI is renpy default because I ran out of time due to personal emergencies etc.</p>\n<p>- Sleepovers are not available yet</p>\n<p>- Two dates are available for Robin, one date for Creed. Iris will always reject your request</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1eebad3c9d47db9a0c763dea07a97c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rooftops Revolution"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
