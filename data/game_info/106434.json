What's more, the game features nice multicolor graphics and superb digisynth music.<br/> <br/> What is Ice Guys all about? The story so far: During the last, snow-rich winter, from some unknown location lots of little, mean monsters came and decided to kidnap some snowmen! And so, lots of these beloved creatures disappeared over night from gardens, sidewalks and parks, leaving big holes in the beautiful winter landscape. Two former Antarctic researchers, which are now retired and have opened an ice caf\u00e9, can't accept this impertinence by any means. They work out a plan and decide to fight against the nasty little monsters, to let the snowmen return to freedom.<br/> <br/> Ice Guys features a unique game concept, Bubble Bobble could be a named as a far relative. The objective is to throw snowballs at the little unfriendly beasts, so that these get stuck in an avalanche. You then can push this avalanche, it will roll down and hit further monsters - but be careful, as you probably don't want to hit your team mate or even become a victim of your own avalanche! In the beginning the enemies can be defeated quite easily, so you can make yourself familiar with the game. But soon it will become harder and fighting the monsters won't be that smooth!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36ee552f10d03c1c54799d7aea675a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Protovision"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
