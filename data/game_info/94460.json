Each crew member consumes oxygen and carbon (aka food) periodically.</p><p>When harvesting planets, there is a small chance find new crew members or lose existing ones. New crew members will be assigned a random role (Builder, Scientist or Harvester). Scientists will automatically consume silicon to advance the artifact research progress.</p><p>Click the 'HELP' button for more information.</p><p><em>NOTE: You cannot interact with the crew screen or reassign roles, and the ship building is purely cosmetic.</em><br/></p><p>This entry was inspired by <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, <em>EVE Online</em>, <em>Aurora </em>and <em>Prison Architect</em>.</p>\u00ab RESOURCES \u00bb<ul><li><strong>Oxygen </strong>- Needed for crew survival</li><li><strong>Carbon </strong>- Used as food (if depleted, oxygen consumption increases)</li><li><strong>Silicon </strong>- Consumed by scientists to advance research</li><li><strong>Iron </strong>- Needed to build tiles</li><li><strong>Hydrogen </strong>- Used as fuel for jumping between stars</li></ul>\u00ab CONTROLS \u00bb<ul><li><strong>GENERAL</strong><ul><li>Right-click and middle click: Drag camera</li></ul><ul><li>Scroll wheel: Zoom camera</li></ul><ul><li>Left-click on a planet on the \"planet survey\" list: Harvest planet</li></ul></li><li><strong>BUILD MODE</strong><ul><li>Activate by clicking the button on the lower left of the 'Mothership' screen</li><li>Left click: place tile</li></ul></li><li><strong>GALAXY SCREEN</strong><ul><li>Left clicking on a star sets a new destination</li></ul></li></ul>\u00ab CHANGELOG \u00bb[LD36-v1.1]\r\n- Added sounds\r\n- Added help screen\r\n- Doubled fuel efficiency, for some reason", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5dc/5dc947508adc633141550df64e3ca6b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["fabsy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
