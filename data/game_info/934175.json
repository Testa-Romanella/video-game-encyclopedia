Through an engaging immersive experience, users will be able to live the myth firsthand, assuming the role of one of the seven Athenian boys or girls, a tribute imposed by Minos on the defeated Athenians. The project aims to be both educational and exploratory, as users will find themselves inside the famous labyrinth, with the objective of finding the way out, while escaping the dangerous Minotaur, and discovering the story hidden within. The project will have a strong narrative and interactive character: during exploration, users will uncover details about the famous story of Theseus and Ariadne, as well as about the construction of the labyrinth by the ingenious Daedalus, by solving puzzles, environmental challenges, and engaging with the game world.\r\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, the project should be seen as a prototype of a series of applications, each dedicated to a different ancient Greek myth; an educational application in which user choices will make interactions, paths, and actions to be performed anything but obvious.\r\n</p>\n<p>The aim of the application is to allow users to virtually immerse themselves in the mythological stories of ancient Greece and the events connected to them, such as the famous story of Ariadne and Theseus, the dynamics of the construction of the labyrinth itself, and, of course, the myth of the Minotaur, the antagonist of the story.\r\n</p>\n<p>The project is educational, exploratory, and logical: the work includes a vast narrative section, composed of dialogues with well-known characters of the time or collectible texts scattered throughout the game map, and interactive, during which users will be able to delve into the related stories, by solving puzzles and environmental challenges to progress in the narrative.\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>You need your <strong>Meta Quest 2\u00a0</strong>and controllers</p>\n<ul><li>To <strong>teleport</strong>, click the trigger button to select and press A to confirm;</li><li>To <strong>grab </strong>object, click the grip button on the controler's side;</li><li>To acces the <strong>menu </strong>grab the tablet on your left hip;</li><li>To light around you, grab the <strong>torch </strong>on your right hip;</li></ul>\n<p>You will learn specific actions as you progress in the game and by playing through the\u00a0tutorial.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<p>As the application is developed for VR, the interaction with the environment (objects and NPCs) is its key feature. Users can grab up to two objects simultaneously (one for each hand) through the controllers. This allows the player to move the objects in the surrounding environment to complete puzzles or progress through the story and, in general, increase the immersiveness. Here are some of the main interactions:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Collecting/delivering objects to/from various NPCs scattered throughout the Labyrinth;\r\n</li><li>Grabbing and using one's torch (stored in the \"right pocket\") to light various obstacles (doors covered in brambles) or light other torches to provide additional illumination;\r\n</li><li>Moving walls or objects to solve various environmental puzzles;\r\n</li><li>Inserting the correct objects/keys to complete mosaics;\r\n</li><li>Reassembling broken objects (amphorae, statues) to learn more stories about the various myths;\r\n</li><li>Dialogue with NPCs to learn about the various myths or elements within them to solve other puzzles;\r\n</li><li>Grabbing the menu (diegetic: a parchment) in the \"left pocket\" to access it.\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<p>Windows:\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>download the .zip file</li><li>extract the file</li><li>connect your headset to your PC</li><li>run the file 'The Labyrinth VR.exe'</li></ol>\n\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n<p>The Labyrinth - VR<em>\u00a0</em>is an independent game developed\u00a0for the\u00a0Virtual Reality course\u00a0(a.y. 2022/2023) of Politecnico di Torino as an <em>edutainment </em>application.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><strong><em>Team #5 (Alphabetical Order)</em></strong></em></p>\n<ul><li>Sacha\u00a0Baril\r\n</li><li>Dorsa\u00a0Bayat\r\n</li><li>Matteo Giuseppe\u00a0Filpi\r\n</li><li>Cristiano\u00a0Santalucia\r\n</li><li>Mattia Scagliola\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nReferences\r\n<p>Most of models and textures where made by us, using Blender and Photoshop.
