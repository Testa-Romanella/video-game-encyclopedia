With roguelite deckbuilding and hex-based tactics, players are no longer bound by simple attack and defense. Make use of dodges and knockbacks to stay alive!<br />\nFEATURESDynamic Deckbuilding<br />\nPick up dozens of cards, keep the ones you need, and craft a unique deck as you fight your way through randomized levels that present a different challenge each run!<br />\nHex-based Tactics<br />\nUnlike traditional deckbuilders that focus on attack and defense, the tactics element adds a dimension of positioning. Dupe your enemies into attacking each other, or use the terrain to gain an upper hand.<br />\nDual Equipment System<br />\nCarry equipment in both hands to enhance your cards! You can dual wield daggers for extra damage, go with a sword &amp; shield combo for rounded performance, or wreak havoc with a two-handed weapon. Figure out the best combination for each fight!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T09:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/0b9/0b96ea912bb9c6052784fccff6ee3d9a.jpg", "website": "http://www.pinixgames.com/", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 60, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 288, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["PINIX"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["IndieArk", "PINIX"], "esrb_rating": null}
