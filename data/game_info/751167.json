We also provide a digital ROM file compatible with the Analogue Pocket.</p>\n<p>You can load the digital ROM file on your favorite emulator, but we highly recommend choosing the original GameBoy black and white mode with four shades of green as seen on our screenshots. This is because the game was designed with the original GameBoy and GameBoy Pocket in mind. However, should you choose to play on the GameBoy Color, please switch to a more appropriate color palette to\u00a0not to ruin the immersion. The default colors the GameBoy Color uses (the bright blues and greens) will not be appropriate for the experience.<br/><br/>The demo is free, but if you liked it and are intrigued by the concept, please consider buying the full game so we can make more games like this one.\u00a0Thank you so much.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T06:52:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b1c2c6cf09e88bf12837b1f38c154a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["AppSir Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
