That's why we should mind very much how we act with someone during lifetime, so he or she wouldn't bother and make problems to us when passed away. People believe that spirits come out at night and mostly the spirits of bad persons we knew in life. Others see pictures of famous faces while dreaming and you get the story like \u2013 oh, my god, I didn't pray for that person, and now he or she is coming out in a dream to scare me or to fight with me.Believing in something is such a strong condition of a humankind, we are led by principles, by ideals, confessions and they teach us how to become better. Maybe being an atheist actually is the strongest confession one can choose, because you need to put negative sign in front of any believing possible.<br/><br/>In today's game we have prepared for you, we are giving some time back to the paranormal psychology. You may not believe in it, so you won't have, but you can enjoy the game and have real fun.<br/><br/>Witching Hour is a term that is used the mostly when the ghosts appear after midnight and when their power is biggest.
