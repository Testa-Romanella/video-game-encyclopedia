It's up to you to decide how to portion out work and prayer: do you send that spare villager to gather much-needed food, or to pray at the Fire God's shrine? Maybe those prayers will stop any future volcanic eruptions - which is good, right? But if your food drops too low, your people start dying.</p><p>This is a short game, over in about 20-40 minutes depending on how you play. In that time, the player goes from a tiny tribe of 2 people to an island swarming with villagers, covered in temples and assailed from all sides.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/843/84339bd187563a16390a141d2c49fbc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["James Patton"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
