If the gamepad doesn't work try to restart the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The game doesn't save your progress between play sessions, but you can use cheat codes to help you get back to the game easier. Read about cheat codes below.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>In the game you have 4 separate abilities which are teached to you at the start of the game: Sprint, dash, melee attack, ranged attack</p>\n<p>You can combine these abilities to be more effective in combat:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold down the shoot button to shoot a more powerful shot.</li><li>Dash into enemies to deal damage to them.</li><li>Press melee attack immediately after dashing to attack further.</li><li>Press ranged attack immediately\u00a0after dashing to shoot a more powerful shot without charging it up.</li><li>Buck bullets with the melee attack.</li></ul>\r\nOther controls:\r\n<ul><li>You can pause the game with the escape key or the menu button.</li><li>In the pause screen you can enter <strong>screenshot mode</strong> by pressing H on the keyboard or select on a gamepad. Enabling this will disable all UI while the game is paused.</li><li>You can mute the music by pressing M.</li></ul>\r\nCheat codes:\r\n<p>The game is around <strong>20 minutes to complete</strong>, but I know that some people will don't have that much time for it, or the game is too hard for them. So I added 2 different <strong>cheat codes</strong> to the game, so you can easily finish the game and check out the ending.\u00a0To use a cheat code, just simply start typing the code, no need to open any menu for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cheat codes:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>\"unlock\"</strong>\u00a0- Set the soul requirement for the end to 0, so you can finish the game any time.</li><li><strong>\"killall\"\u00a0</strong>- Kills every enemy in the current area you're in.</li></ul>\r\nSocial:\r\n<ul><li>Itch page:\u00a0https://vingames.itch.io/</li><li>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/DKpbVKk</li><li>Youtube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/channel/UCo-V8qAlHZWFRkUDCtc0cyQ</li><li>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/VinarkDev</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>All code and art was made during the one week period of the game jam.</li><li>Sound effects were downloaded from\u00a0https://freesound.org/\u00a0and modified by me.</li><li>Music was created by EmInSpace:<ul><li>https://www.youtube.com/c/EmInSpace</li><li>https://www.twitch.tv/eminspace</li><li>EmInSpace - itch.io</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09aa17641b601f8acbe2ae291b0d1685.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Vinark117"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
