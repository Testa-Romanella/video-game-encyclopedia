It was made over the course of a week for <strong>Coffee Jam</strong>. Six coffees assisted in the making of this game (see below).</p>\n<p>The goal is to get to work on time, but it's early and you're a little weak in the knees.\u00a0 What did you do last night anyway?\u00a0This walking thing isn't as easy as you remembered.\u00a0Luckily you have a travel mug full of coffee, hooray!</p>\n<p>Take a sip of coffee every so often to keep your balance and collision endurance up. Try not to run out of coffee though!</p>\n\r\n* A controller is recommended for this game.\r\nKeyboard Controls:\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>: Move, Menu Navigation<br/><strong>Arrow Keys</strong>: Camera<br/><strong>Space:</strong> Drink Coffee<br/><strong>Left Shift: </strong>Walk (while moving)<br/><strong>R:</strong> Quick Reset</p>\r\nPlaystation Controls:\r\n<p><strong>Left Stick:</strong> Move (walk &amp; run)<br/><strong>D-Pad:</strong> Menu navigation<br/><strong>Right Stick:</strong>\u00a0Camera<br/><strong>Cross:</strong> Drink Coffee<br/><strong>Triangle:</strong> Quick Reset</p>\r\nXbox Controls:\r\n<p><strong>Left Stick:</strong> Move (walk &amp; run)<br/><strong>D-Pad:</strong> Menu navigation<br/><strong>Right Stick:</strong>\u00a0Camera<br/><strong>A:</strong> Drink Coffee<br/><strong>Y:</strong> Quick Reset</p>\n\r\nIn Memoriam:\r\n<p>Coffee Chris<br/>Frappuccino Frank<br/>Coffee Candace<br/>Coffee Chloe<br/>French Vanilla Victor<br/>Coffee Cameron</p>\n<p>Audio samples found at\u00a0http://www.freesfx.co.uk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/034/03461208cf92bb2a8407dcf69228480a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kevin Whitmore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
