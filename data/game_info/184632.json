I wanted to explore creating some sort of roguelike, and I combined that with some inspiration from Die Hard and Max Headroom. It's current state is playable, but it's more a tech demo than a full game.</p>HOW TO PLAY<p>Navigate the mazes and kill as many red capsules as you can while you search for the floor exit (the bright yellow floor tile). Touching the red capsules reduces your score, and falling off the tower restarts your run.</p>CONTROLS<br/><ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> - Move</li><li><strong>Mouse</strong> - Shoot</li><li><strong>ESC</strong> - Return to Menu</li></ul>CREDITS<br/><ul><li><strong>Chris Langford</strong> - Code/Design</li><li><strong>Anthony Swinnich</strong> - Music</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51c/51c47fec77b7456ab908355e975c2c93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CLD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
