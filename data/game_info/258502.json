{"id": 258502, "slug": "two-ball-game", "name": "Two Ball Game", "name_original": "Two Ball Game", "description": "7 WORLDS<br/>- This game requires unprecedented skill, coordination, timing \u2014 and a steady VERY hand!<br/>- Explore the entire universe of 9 challenges over 7 worlds.<br/>- Replay or jump to any world, but be warned \u2014 you'll never survive the advanced levels unless you have earned your place the hard way!<br/><br/>The app consists of two fireballs rotating clockwise and counter-clockwise to avoid stationary and moving beams. As if that wasn\u2019t challenging enough, the rounds must be completed within a certain number of moves. This creates additional play value since you will want to keep playing the same round, even after you beat it, to improve on your score.<br/><br/>In the game ,,Two Ball Game'' there are 7 stages. Each stage of the app consists of several levels. As the stages increase in number, they also increase in difficulty and speed. For example, in level one you may be dodging a few stationary beams, but in level seven, the beams are different shapes and sizes, they may rotate and move in different directions, and they may turn invisible.<br/><br/>The levels become very challenging and addicting to conquer, so it is great that you don\u2019t get a certain number of lives. When you die you just go back to the beginning of the game you were already on, no dying and going back to level one!<br/><br/>This game will definitely test your speed and reaction time as moving beams zip by and you have to adjust the position of your fireballs accordingly. With the large number of games in each level and the large difference in skill requirements between levels, it\u2019s great for those who are new to games as well as experienced gamers.<br/><br/><br/>App Features<br/><br/>The home screen is simple and clean. Containing only three icons (play, settings, and game centre), it is quick and easy to navigate to exactly where you want to go. The settings screen is also simple, containing controls for the music and sound volume. The game has a pause feature so you won\u2019t lose your spot if you get interrupted, though this shouldn\u2019t be a problem since the games move so quick!<br/><br/>It is easy for beginners to learn the app controls with the help of the quick tutorial at the beginning of Level 1. It illustrates that when you tap the left side of the screen, the fireballs rotate counter-clockwise by a fraction, the longer you hold it, the farther they will move. When you touch the right side of the screen, the fireballs rotate in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>The app also allows you to share your progress with friends, via Google+ and Facebook so you can stay competitive!<br/><br/>MESMERIZING MUSIC<br/>= Audio in Two Ball Game features the electronic stylings of a world-renowned DJ.<br/>= Each hypnotic track has been specifically designed for the game.<br/><br/>Why It\u2019s Great<br/><br/>The app is simple and challenging, fast paced and fulfilling, addicting but easy to pause\u2026 It\u2019s the perfect app to have while waiting in a long line or when you have a free minute between classes.

And you can be an expert gamer or someone new to game apps to enjoy it!<br/><br/>UNIVERSAL APP<br/>| Enjoy Two Ball Game on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch!<br/>| Game Centre support<br/><br/>ULTIMATE SUPPORT<br/>= Contact us at [TwoBallGame@appidea.com]<br/><br/>Website: https://appidea.com<br/>Facebook: https://facebook.com/554637954658621<br/>Google +: https://plus.google.com/106406031217657105509", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/23628c648a1a5e5ef14e08786eeece35.jpg", "website": "http://appidea.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["zurab inaishvili"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["zurab inaishvili"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
