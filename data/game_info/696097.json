For a good cause as well! Used GDevelop5 to make it, because I don't know anything when it comes to actual coding languages. MillerTheGreat helped out with creating sprites, while I made the sound effects, and I genuinely enjoy how they and the game turned out. I hope you all like my first game :)<br/></p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Blast away trash and watch out for local sealife! If you accidentally zap sealife, you will be penalized. If you are hit, or let any trash escape, you will also be penalized. Try to get the highest score you can. Shoot Heart PowerUps to gain an extra life. Colliding with the PowerUp does not award benefit. Good luck and have fun!</p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Sound Effects may lag the first time they are loaded.</p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________<br/></p>\n<p>Default Controls are:</p>\n<p>Move Up : Up Arrow Key</p>\n<p>Move Down : Down Arrow Key</p>\n<p>Zap : Spacebar</p>\n<p><strong>Controls CAN be changed through settings if you'd like.</strong></p>\n<p>__________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>MillerTheGreatYT\u00a0- Sprite Work (Sock, Mask, Six Pack Can Holder), Playtester</p>\n<p>Pixel Font : Rainy Hearts -\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/rainyhearts.font</p>\n<p>Title Font :\u00a0Fighting Spirit TBS -\u00a0https://www.fontspace.com/fighting-spirit-tbs-font-f7045</p>\n<p>Developed with GDevelop5</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T05:55:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4892cd487ea69e9c20daec28519f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MagicalMCBoss"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
