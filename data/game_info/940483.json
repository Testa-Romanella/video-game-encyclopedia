This game is pretty cool but probably not very balanced. I tried to make a platformer + a roguelike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this game you play as\u00a0<strong>Agent 7\u00a0</strong>who has to go into a dream world and try and remember what he can when he wakes up. He can only remember one thing each run, and use it again in his next run, so pick what to remember wisely.\u00a0Thanks for Playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T09:31:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3b/a3bf14f4af5204f29b02d30370207cb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["WalkerSheep"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
