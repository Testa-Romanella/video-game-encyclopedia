The Alpacas knew that the world truly belonged to themselves, but stood no chance against the sudden increase of humans... So they decided to make a plan. \r\n</p>\n<p>First they will feign stupidity so that they can approach the humans and integrate into their society. This will give them the time they need to create more soldiers, who will each be ready to reclaim the world at a moment's notice. They will do this while secretly placing their alpha alpacas near strategic locations, where they will lie in wait until they are finally given the orders to attack. \u00a0</p>\n<p>You are an alpha Alpaca! Your role is to target and destroy a nearby military base to weaken the humans in the surrounding area. The base is well defended and it is unlikely that you will find a safe way in... Unless!
