The game is divided into sixteen levels.<br />\nThe player must get through each of them slaying hordes of enemies. Most of the levels consist of the arena-like room where you have to defeat waves of monsters to progress. Some levels end up with battles against huge Bosses that require player shoot specific parts of their bodies. The game takes place in different areas of purgatory. Some of them resemble specific historical settings like ancient Rome, ancient Egypt or medieval Japan. Completing specific tasks awards player with tarot-cards that give Belial special powers. <br />\nThe Belial\u2019s weaponry is different from that of Daniel through most of the weapons are similar in mechanics to their counterparts from the original game. Every weapon has at least two firing modes. For example, Bonegun can act like a typical shotgun or turn enemies into stone; razor cube can rotate metal projectiles at high speed, draw enemies to Belial or slowly shoot metal projectiles.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2007-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-12T09:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f62252dc22176f33db0e71593935481.jpg", "website": "http://www.painkilleroverdose.com", "rating": 3.28, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 1214, "beaten": 94, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 40, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 112, "suggestions_count": 627, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 113, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mindware Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": null}
