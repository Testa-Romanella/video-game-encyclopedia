In this Slenderman-style  game, you will impersonate Goya himself being trapped inside a nightmare  and being chased by his own art, in a terrorific intent of recovering  the control of his work.\r\n </p>\n<p>The game is about exploring a nightmarish house,  supposedly Goya\u2019s home, where you will find his art scattered around on  the walls. The goal is to find and recover these five pieces of art  without being trapped by Saturno, a soul-eating monster that will chase  you around the house.\r\n </p>\n<p>The sensation of being trapped in a laberynth will never  disappear, as the walls and hallways will move around while you collect  the art. The layout of the house will be different every time.\r\n </p>\n<p>The only room that will not be affected by these changes  is the central hub. Your starting point and safe area. Here will be  displayed the empty paintings that you need to find, and they will be  filled with the corresponding art pieces when you recover them. There is  no HUD in the game so this will be your only option to keep track of  your progress.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T05:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3dee09a1874d46fe8d5eff9d44b40da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YagoB", "Franc Porta", "Mefiso", "Lowy Sol\u00e9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
