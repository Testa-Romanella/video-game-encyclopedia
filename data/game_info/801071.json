Help Solana jump, shoot and think her way through the perils and dangers ahead to rescue the missing facility workers!<br/>There are nine levels in total, and a few secret areas to find and unlock too.<br/><h3>Enjoy the rewards!</h3>Zetria is made from fully hand-crafted pixel art, from the environments to the alien monsters making up the cast.
