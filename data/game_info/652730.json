If you survive for 60 seconds, you have won!</p>\n<p>Made for\u00a0<strong>One Minute Game jams #1</strong>\u00a0with the theme\u00a0<strong>Wired</strong>. The theme reminded me of old arcade cabinets with their components and wiring all within the machine. I tried to embrace the arcade-genre and emulate the aesthetic of the cabinet screens in the graphics for this game.</p>\n\nnano_3f8tei7tim3wjja3px1pqz7mjs11j7s5hpx7cyw6ktw8bhbykebgsn8bdq5c<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4bda21d3059a071c938240ed976833.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DirectCherry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
