The theme was 'Final Boss' and the limitation was 'Stuck in a Loop.' Feel free to play and enjoy the game.</p>\n\n<p>As of the time of writing, the game's story is finished. The only thing I did not add, is images. I had a few prepared, but I felt it would take too long to finish them, and so I removed them. At some point I may go back and re-add them to the game to make it look better, but by the time the jam is finished , they will not be present in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T07:56:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d15/d157bcebcaa078d464d5e4c2eccbe406.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NcsAsp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
