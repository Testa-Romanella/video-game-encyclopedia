They were left to live there as empty shells; for they were stolen the capability to bear any feelings. The children venture each year,\u00a0on a trip through the dark galleries of the cave, with hope of finding a way out to the real world. The journey is cruel and merciless, and they must cross the darkness with a special candle lit by their very souls. They say unspeakable things lurk through the tunnels of the cave, and many other temptations drive children astray from their paths, as sometimes they chase after feelings, which overfly the Grotto in the shape of shining butterflies.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30c/30c1b9f304d3bb284dd841280daf8c45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["leoroura"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
