And I have to tell you,  the road is not becoming easier. On the contrary, it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to be an indie developer. Not having the resources to go full-time, I am doing this as a hobby. But I can assure you that I\u2019m not taking it lightly. I\u2019m learning a lot, and my aim is to improve the games I create. I can just hope, that you will feel these improvements in this game. I know that I still have a long way to go, but I will do my best to create games that You and fellow gamers can enjoy.<br/><br/>In the end, I just wanted to say thank you for checking out my game. I hope you will have fun playing it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T02:28:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c13fb5b70ee8d47880dec758e66c5461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Bit Studio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["One Bit Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
