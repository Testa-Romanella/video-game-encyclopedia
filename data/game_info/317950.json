Made in Unity v2018.2.5.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>--Consists of five levels in which the player controls 2 characters, moving at the same rate and making identical simultaneous actions. The player's goal is to act as the \"brotherly bond\" between the two characters and help them leap over the obstacles that they face along the track.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>--I decided to make this game because of/for my brother, who's graduating high school this summer. I was thinking about the fact that we hadn't been talking in a while, and decided to make a simple game about the power of the bond between two siblings.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>-- Credits:\u00a0<br/>-Player model by Akishaqs\u00a0<br/>-Traffic cone model and texture by Ninjacupcake Indie Studio\u00a0<br/>- Fence model and texture by Timothy Porter\u00a0<br/>-Street texture by LowlyPoly\u00a0<br/>- Level design and documentation by Peter Cimino</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:15:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff207e747977d7f0aea7c7e211a00c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PeterCimino"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
