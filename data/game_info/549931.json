The player can move about the overground with the A &amp; D keys or the Arrow Keys. By pressing the spacebar, the player can position their drill-hook and, by pressing the spacebar again, launch it down into Earth\u2019s surface to clear away the dirt and find special objects. Rocks and boulders will get in the way, but if the player hooks onto something special, they can mash the spacebar to drag it to the surface. Good luck excavating!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2021! The theme: Lost and found.</p>\n<p>By Jared Nolen and Nathann Latimore.
