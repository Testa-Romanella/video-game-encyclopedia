For mouse and touch controls, press along a cardinal direction from the player character and it will move in that direction.</p>\n<p>Press the Spacebar or the left\u00a0button in the bottom right corner\u00a0to toggle between Push mode and Swap mode. Some obstacles can be pushed, and others can be both pushed and swapped.</p>\n<p>Press R or the right\u00a0button in the bottom right corner\u00a0\u00a0to reset the room and try again.</p>\n<p>Hover over objects on the game board to see a Hint about them on the bottom of the screen.<br/></p>\n<p>Reach the green portal to finish each level.\u00a0Try to collect all the gold squares!</p>\r\nInfo\r\n<p>I wrote this little Boulderdash clone for\u00a0Remake the Classics Jam. I started 5 days into the jam, messed around with basics for several after that,\u00a0and I didn't finish as much of the game\u00a0as I would have liked. Many mechanic ideas had to be cut, and the small collection of\u00a0levels\u00a0was made haphazardly on the last day of the jam!</p>\n<p>Still, the game can be played and finished, so I am entering it in the jam anyway!</p>\r\nTrivia\r\n<ul><li>This game was written in C and uses SDL2, stb_image, minimp3, and some little libraries of my own. The web build uses Emscripten.</li><li>The game code itself is\u00a0only 3758 SLOC spread across 15 files, excluding generated files for audio and sprites. A big chunk of that is for generating the asset files, so the actual amount of code for the game is closer to ~2500 LOC.</li><li>The web build of the game has a smaller compressed size than the native build.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T14:33:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533f390bb59d73cf73084c30061eed06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["charlie.zip"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
