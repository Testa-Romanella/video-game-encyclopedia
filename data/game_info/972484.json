Choose among the proposed maps, unite and combine the elements to create your unique mix, reflecting the process of fierce battle in abstract 2D space.<br/><br/>You can move up and down, and capture the nearby elements. Captured elements will deliver their sound, and by combining elements from both players (air, water, fire, earth) a unique musical blend is created. With capturing two elements, the spells become available depening on the elments pairing: air+water, air+fire, water+earth, fire+earth. Hitting enemy with the spells reduces their hit points, while captured elements increase hit points. When the music ends, the player with most hit points wins the match. <br/><br/>Play multiplayer against other people, then you have controls: W,S - movement, E - capturing, Z,X,C,V - spells.<br/>Play locally with a friend or alone, then the 2nd player has controls: Up, Down - movement, Enter - capturing, J,K,L,: - spells.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T04:05:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65c35952ceb21cf88456860b8eb1864.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yamir"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Yamir"], "esrb_rating": null}
