There is also a power-up in form of \"Jumpboots\", which will double your jump-height.<br/>If you die, you will drop whatever Goldbars and power-ups you have collected and respawn.<br/>If you lost all of your lives, then a Grave will appear, displaying the name of the dead Player.<br/>'ndyans will shoot arrows which will kill you and if you run into either an 'ndyan or a vulture, you will lose one life. Same goes if another Cowboy shoots you.<br/>You can also use your knife to stab, but that should be used only as a last resort.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T03:59:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72bdcaf8bcdf3f39518985c7326d26d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lord_Santa"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
