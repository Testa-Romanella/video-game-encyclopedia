Each liquidator has their own set of skills to provide a variety of approaches for each hazardous challenge. Whether they all make it out, or succeed at all, is in your hands. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>This project is dedicated to all the liquidators, first responders, and support units that responded to the Chernobyl disaster.</strong> Through interactivity, people have a fresh way to experience the danger and horrors of their mission firsthand, with this being only one of many. It is our goal to raise awareness/support for the people that contained the fallout. <br/><br/>Originally, we did this by promoting donations for Chernobyl Children International and similar organizations in lieu of paying for the game. However, as the devastating war in Ukraine has unfolded (including a terrifying standoff at Chernobyl), we are now asking that players donate to the UNICEF fund for affected Ukrainian children. <br/><br/>UNICEF Ukrainian Children's Fund: https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/where-unicef-works/europe/ukraine<br/><br/>(We are not affiliated with UNICEF, Chernobyl Children International, or any other organization. We chose to showcase UNICEF and Chernobyl Children International because of their reputation. This game was an independently developed student project by a small team of volunteers from various backgrounds.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T20:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fabdf70bd700adecc94796ec2484a687.jpg", "website": "https://www.liquidatorsarchive.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 260, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CL1986", "Gray Unit"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Juggernaut Entertainment", "Gray Unit"], "esrb_rating": null}
