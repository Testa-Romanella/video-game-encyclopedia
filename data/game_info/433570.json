Solve puzzles and talk to NPCs. You've played RPG Maker games before, you know how it works.</p>\n<p>There are 3 chapters to play, each with a major puzzle to solve and some little ones inbetween. Maybe an hour or so of gameplay. It's not finished and probably wont ever will be, but I may add to it some other day.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is not actually called Funny Dog Game, but it would be rude to say the real name so. There. Consider the title screen to be a fun surprise.<br/></p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n<p>Arrows - move<br/>Shift - hold to run<br/>X - open menu, cancel<br/>Z - confirm, talk,\u00a0 examine, etc<br/>F5 - restart<br/>ALT+ENTER - fullscreen/window mode<br/></p>\r\nIN THIS ESSAY I DISCUSS SOME DESIGNER'S NOTES\r\n<p>Sorry, this page is so lazy and disorganized. It's a poor excuse, but it fits the game better than you may think.<br/></p>\n<p>I made this game when I was frustrated and angry. I still feel that way sometimes. The result is a frustrating and pointless game. Not because of the gameplay, I am proud of that part, but the narrative and enviroments are not. I made the first part on a tv and had no clue that the colors were so wack. I forget if I ever adjusted it or not. I don't like to think about it.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a puzzle game I made. It doesn't really have a point but I like it a lot because 99% of it was made by me. The remaining 50% was by the RPG Maker community programmers (full credits avaliable in game), may their souls rest in peaces. They're not dead, but they still deserve your prayers for working with RPGM MV's code base. I started this game with RPG Maker VX Ace and then ported it over to MV at some point with intent to continue it. I didn't.<br/></p>\n<p>Is this a comedy game? If it makes you laugh, then maybe it is. It's up to you.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is where I found out I like designing puzzles. That's about it.\u00a0 Also I like the music I made for this game. I don't have more to say than that about that. Really.<br/></p>\n<p>The not-actually-it's-name, \"Funny Dog Game\", came from someone who recognised my game on another site that I posted updates to and was like.... Oh, it's that game with the funny dog. It's a nice interaction I'll remember for a long while I think. A good memory. That place doesn't exist anymore (at least not how it did) and it makes me sad sometimes, but oh well. Things changed or maybe I just didn't understand how it really was in the first place. 2016 was very weird, as you all know.<br/></p>\n<p>Re: a fed up Cortok who needed to do something that makes them feel productive so. I'll feel better sooner or later. Probably tomorrow. Actually I already feel a bit better.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:58:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3cacaab34b1510e06a374c3753945367.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cortok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
