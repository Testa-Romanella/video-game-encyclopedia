Good luck figuring out which ones!<br/><br/>The main idea of the game is that you can Jump and Dash for mobility around the arena while throwing Axes at other players. You may also find Treasure Chests while battling which when opened will grant you Axe Upgrades, which are very powerful tools to come out on top of your friends.<h3>The Modes</h3><h3>Axedown</h3>The main objective is to push all players out of the Arena and not die while doing so. Every player gets a set amount of lives and when they are thrown out of the Arena they lose one. The last player alive wins.<h3>Deathmatch</h3>The players' main objective is to score Kills by pushing other players out of the Arena, without any regard for their own lives as there are infinite of those. This mode is timed, when the time ends the player with the most kills reigns victorious.<h3>Treasure Hunt</h3>This mode, unlike the others, doesn't have anything to do with Kills or Deaths. There are glowing Treasure Chests that spawn around the map and the main objective is to open those, scoring a point and giving all players the same random Axe Upgrade.<h3>Our Plans</h3><br/>We plan on making this game as great as it can be.
