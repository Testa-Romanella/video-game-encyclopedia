Tiro is an apprentice star spirit. In order to graduate a full Star themselves, they must complete constellations using fragments of stars.<br/></p><p>Very simple gameplay controls, only use the mouse to control Tiro. Red stars are anti-astral and will destroy themselves and another star fragment if they collide. White stars flock together, as do the anti-astral stars.<br/></p><p>All assets used were either made myself (including music) or provided to me by the SFAS specification.</p><p>I really hope you enjoy my game and would love any feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1f0a18daccdfa1f5be87a22df64e7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JDodger"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
