Developed for my Experimental Games Class at Drexel. I have included the paper I submitted below. I recommend that you play in FullScreen Mode. <br/>\"<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nI have created StarField 476 as a way of conveying my thoughts about\r\nthe AAA games industry currently. I am conveying my thoughts on big\r\ndevelopers, specifically EA, Bethesda and \r\nTreyarch, shipping\r\nincomplete, slapped together, cash-grab content for full $60 and then\r\nexpecting their consumers to spend even more money for features that\r\nshould have been there from the beginning, or pay for content that\r\nwill give them a boost in the game leaving others behind.\r\nSpecifically I am targeting Star Wars Battlefront 2, developed by EA.\r\nThey launched the game with content that would take 3,000 \u2013 4,000\r\nhours or $2,100 to unlock all of the content in the game, players\r\ncould get a huge boost in the multiplayer content by getting better\r\ncharacters and guns for an extra $20 at release. The single player\r\nmode that was hugely advertised and ended up being 4 hours long.\r\nBattlefield 5, another EA game that heavily influenced me had very\r\nsimilar issues to that of Star Wars and also shipped with normal\r\nmodes such as the \u201cpractice range\u201d and the \u201cTides of war\u201d\r\nmodes that were not available in the game until December 4th\r\nand December 6th. </p>\n<p>As I could not get\r\naccess to the assets of these games I was referencing, I utilized the\r\ngame covers of these games as well as Fallout 75 and Call of Duty 4.\r\nI use these title images to show going into the game what you are\r\nexpecting to get beyond the first paywall. I also used still images\r\nof Storm Troopers from the star wars series as enemies in the game,\r\nthis is to show the slapped together appearance as it is just a\r\nliteral skin on an already existing shooter game. These have no AI to\r\nexaggerate the poor attention put into the AI and design. I also\r\nutilized a gun that I received from the asset store and created my\r\nown laser shots to resemble that of star wars series. </p>\n<p>I hope to get across\r\nthat you work hard for your money, it takes a long time to earn $60.\r\nThen you finally pull it all together and purchase a game, Star Wars\r\nBattlefront 2 for instance, and as you get into the game, you find\r\nthat it is poorly put together and that you don\u2019t even get the full\r\nexperience as you hit paywalls and timewalls within the game. This\r\nrequires waiting for the content that should have been there or\r\nworking for more money to get the full game. I hope that this pushes\r\nplayers to rethink what they are paying for when they support these\r\ncompanies, and to see that they are being exploited.</p>\n<p>\"</p>\n<p>The following assets are not mine:</p>\n<p>Fallout 76 image : Bethesda</p>\n<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 4: Treyarch<br/></p>\n<p>BattleField 5 image: EA</p>\n<p>Starwars Battlefront 2 Image: EA</p>\n<p>StormTrooper Image: Disney</p>\n<p>CGY_ATM: CGY (Yemelyan K.)</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi Gun Light: Factory of models</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi Sfx: Little Robot Sound Factory</p>\n<p>Tileable Bricks Wall: Game-Ready Studio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-18T03:43:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/720/720d575e964fee3d3f486d51d66f2bee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SurrealGaming"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
