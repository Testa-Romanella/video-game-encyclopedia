You're dropped into a maze of rooms with the goal of finding the trophy that completes the game, but make sure to finish with a high score!</p>\n<p>Your trusty axe is the only form of attacking you have. You can throw or retrieve your weapon and ricochet the axe off walls. The\u00a0axe wil damage any enemy in the way, but you have no defense mechanism after throwing it.\u00a0When enemies are closing in and you don't have your axe in hand, evade by dashing through or around enemies and even over spikes!</p>\n<p>In the title screen, you can select either starting the game or learning how to play. Use 'W' and 'S' to move the selection up and down, confirm your selection by pressing \"Enter\" on your keyboard. The game is not compatible with controllers or game pads, only keyboard and mouse. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/337/33770f479d330430bcf2ab5527331691.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Judah Avery"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
