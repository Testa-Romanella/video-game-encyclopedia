I started out without realising the audio mixer existed but once I came across it and worked out how to use it, managing volume levels became a lot easier.</li><li><strong>Secondary camera:</strong> I haven't done one of these before and it was interesting setting it up (the little system scanner in the bottom right) and working out how best to show the contents of the system.</li><li><strong>Shader graphs:</strong> Expanding on my experience using shader graphs in SyRec I used shader graphs here for showing not just damage flashes, but ongoing damage status on ships and asteroids.\r\n</li><li><strong>Parallax background:</strong> I've experimented a bit with parallax  backgrounds before but this is my first serious go at it and I'm really  pleased with the results. It's especially important in Stellar Miner as  it helps visualise your movement speed, as you can be in areas with no  other frame of reference for your movement.\r\n</li><li><strong>Rogue-like system generation:</strong> I've always been interested in procedurally generated levels for games and this is my first serious application of this.</li><li><strong>Object dehydration:</strong> There is potential for THOUSANDS of asteroids to  be spawned in a level in Stellar Miner, and managing so many dynamic  physics objects has a massive processing cost. So asteroids that aren't within a certain radius of the player, and that are in no danger of a collision are \"dehydrated\" (basically, turned off and stored in a list) so just their velocity and acceleration are handled in a much faster and simpler function, leading to:\r\n</li><li><strong>Job system and burst:</strong> Stellar Miner is my first time using the Job system  in unity and also using Burst to make it run even faster. I used these  to handle the velocity and acceleration of the potentially thousands of  asteroids that may be on a level, so that they don't hurt the game performance.</li><li><strong>Coroutines:</strong> I used quite a few of these to manage timed events, such as the damage flashes.</li><li><strong>AI coding:</strong> I had to do a TON of math to get the AI working well! They use exactly the same controls and thrusters as you do so have to account for stopping distances, relative velocity and so on. This is my first dynamic AI that doesn't follow a simple planned script. I also used an \"aggro\" system so they wont start chasing you right away, and only attack if you damage them or loiter near them.</li><li><strong>Math:</strong> Just to reiterate, TONS of math doing all this. It was fun implementing my background in physics and mechanics!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Bugs and issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you look closely at the videos I recorded you can see the asteroids (but not enemies) seem to be slowly falling into the star. This only seems to happen when I'm playing in Unity Editor and I haven't seen it happen in the actual build.</li><li>The \"panic button\" doesn't work perfectly and can sometimes leave your ship oscillating between -1 and +1 rotational velocity. Maybe I've done something wrong but it's been hard finding out precisely how torque and inertia are actually implemented internally in Unity and what torque is required to zero out a rotational velocity. It was a bit of a guesswork to even get it working as well as it does.</li><li>Not really a bug, but projectiles can collide with each other. I'm undecided if I'm happy with this or not. The problem it causes is that if a ship is rotating while firing, the projectiles will sometimes hit each other.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Future features<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>AI improvements: </strong>The AI is a decent challenge but is still quite basic. In later versions I'll add target leading to enemies (so they can react to your movement speed and also use weapons beside lasers), and path finding/obstacle evasion (so they're not so easy to bait into asteroid collisions).</li><li><strong>More ships and weapons: </strong>I haven't even used all the ships and weapons in the space sprite set I've used. There's a third tier of massive ships which also have a massive weapon slot. I'll also add more individual variants (e.g. a homing version of missiles) of each weapon.</li><li><strong>Planet destruction: </strong>Once I've added the firepower of the top tier ships, I'll be adding <strong>planet</strong> destruction. If a system doesn't have enough asteroids? Just go blow up one of those planets. And don't mind the defenders, the atmosphere burning up, or all those bodies going flying off into space when it shatters. Gotta get that loot.</li><li><strong>More enemy types: </strong>Once the enemy AI is upgraded and I've implemented all the ships and weapons, it's time for the enemy to get a firepower upgrade so they will have access to the same range of equipment as the player.</li><li><strong>Menu improvements: </strong>I want to add some more specificity to the menu - e.g. the actual thrust, mass and armour ratings of each ship, but I might need to make some additional art assets beyond the pack I've used.</li><li><strong>Enhanced sector preview: </strong>I'd like to add a \"threat level\" rating to each sector, indicating how well protected it is (and how much loot it has).</li><li><strong>Star system features: </strong>There are a number of extra features I want to add to star systems. For example binary or trinary stars, moon and rings around planets, and surprise hazards such as comets shooting through the system at incredible speed, or the whole system falling into a black hole.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T14:24:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a71e102005bd7e3b35331cddc65a886e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seph"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
