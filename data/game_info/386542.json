We can observe his personal life and even influence it with side effects.<br/><br/>The scene of the game takes place in the body of the protagonist. We see everything that happens to him in real-time on the little screen. We have at our disposal various types of cells of the immune system, controlling which we protect the body from the attacks of harmful bacteria and viruses, as well as train the immune system. Special actions can cause side effects that affect the plot. For example, on a date with a girl, the protagonist can vomit and they break up, which makes the hero depressed and begins to abuse drinks (carbonated lemonade with a high sugar level).<h3>Key Features:</h3><ul><li>Story twists caused by your actions<br/></li><li>30 levels (days from the hero's life)<br/></li><li>Various bosses<br/></li><li>8 types of cells of the immune system that can be upgraded<br/></li><li>Fighting that are requiring difficult tactical decisions</li></ul><br/>I am involved in music, soundtracks for games and the development of small prototypes, and this is my first big independent project!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T02:32:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ff7114adfb7dcfcb596d1afe92d1ebf.jpg", "website": "http://rubelgames.com/listeriawars", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rubel Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rubel Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
