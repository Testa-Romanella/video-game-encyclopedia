{"id": 889344, "slug": "the-royal-feast", "name": "The Royal Feast", "name_original": "The Royal Feast", "description": "<p>You are invited to an annual feast at the Monarch's Grand Palace. However, because people consume each other as food here, the feast will eventually break into a bloody campaign of cannibalism. Your chance of survival depends on the hidden identities of all the guests.</p>\n<p>Traitors masquerade as ministers to build trust with the monarch, only to stab them in the back. Ministers protect the monarch and try to uncover the traitors. In some cases, even the ministers can\u2019t be trusted by the monarch. Everyone knows who the monarch is, so they must use their power to discover the identities of the guests. Everyone knows one role that\u2019s in the game, but no one has the full picture, so learning what your fellow guests know is of utmost importance. Gather money, interrogate guests, and when the time is right, kill who you think is your enemy. Nobody can be trusted.</p>\n<p>- Player interaction</p>\n<p>- Full of surprises/twists</p>\n<p>- Strategic thinking</p><p>Credits:</p><p>- Rosemary Wu: Project lead, Game design, Art</p><p>- Henry Goss-Grubbs: Producer, Playtest manager, Game design</p><p>- Jaden Fragoso: Game design, Rule editor</p><p>- Kaan Ust: Game design, Art</p><p>- Dehao Tu: Game design</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T17:57:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a669ed978ab48d89ac87890779c2723b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["rosemarywu"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
