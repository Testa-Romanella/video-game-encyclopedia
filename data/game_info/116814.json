For both the story and visual style I took inspiration from \"The thief of Bagdad\" a 1924 classic silent adventure movie with Douglas Fairbanks. Game mechanics are of classic  ultra-hard side shooter. In particular I was inspired by \"Agony\" a beautiful yet unforgiving Amiga game from the 90s. Finally most of the enemies come from \"Kunstformen der natur\" a book by Ernst Hackel full of litoghraphic illustrations of bizzare creatures perfectly organized with Prussian precision and devotion to symmetry.</p><p><strong>Music</strong><br/>I would like to thank two musicians who supplied their work <br/>http://sublevel9.net/ - square_wave / Ty Hodson (most of the music in game)<br/>http://miniature-records.com - Minoo (only level 2 music)</p><p><strong>How to play</strong><br/>Use arrows, and Z, X, C or 1, 2, 3 keys to move around and shoot.<br/>I strongly recommend to play the stand alone versions as they can go fullscreen.</p><p><strong><br/>Feedback</strong><br/>@tigsource<br/>@useflashpunk</p><p><strong>Press</strong><br/>Kill Screen<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4aa/4aa76efbd51ae4ed51443948160db591.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["rostok"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
