It seems you have a very good grasp on the theory of anthropomorphization and the history of how primitive organisms evolved to take on more anthro forms over time.\u00a0\u00a0We would like to now officially welcome you to the team here at Phylolabs and give you quick overview of your position here as a lab equipment tester and how you'll be assisting us with our current major research project.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Project SPLICE:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As you've probably already heard in the news recently, there's been an endemic taking hold among the main phylofolk genera, which include the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Plantfolk</li><li>Mammalfolk</li><li>Reptilefolk</li><li>Fishfolk</li><li>Birdfolk</li><li>Insectfolk</li></ul>\n<p>A virus is spreading around\u00a0causing genetic decay within these genera. The way the virus works is that it goes into the very dna of its host and removes vital nucleotide bases.\u00a0 Through this process, the virus seems to be able to change the fundamental behavior of its host. There have been reports of lizardfolk spontaneously changing color, bamboofolk's natural rate of growth being stunted, the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Our lab is currently being funded by the city government in order to find a possible cure. We've taken a sort of role model species from each genera listed above who's been infected with the virus and used them as test subjects. Our research has finally paid off.\u00a0You'll be assisting Dr. Mavey Mangrove, the founder of Phylolabs and current project lead with testing out his new device which he believes could be the solution to this endemic, the Phylosplicer.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Phylosplicer</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>This most recent invention of Dr. Mangrove's is able to split damaged strands apart so that it may go in and replace the missing bases with appropriate ones to complete the base pairs. Once you inject the device into your test subject, you'll be able to see the split strand and control the enzyme on it\u00a0by moving it up and down a molecular chain to fill in the bases. The enzyme itself will show you what current base it holds. \u00a0There are two base pair types for you to match bases with: Blue/Yellow and Red/Green. If there are two or more adjacent pair types next to each other on the strand with missing bases, you can add the proper bases and clear them out of the strand for a combo stack. Each combo stack you make improves the stability of your subject.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>You'll have to be quick though. The virus has also has the ability to control enzymes that will cut off your dna as it moves along, making junk dna and\u00a0further increasing your subject's instability meter shown at the bottom of the phylosplicer hub. If too much junk dna is made, then the subject will become completely unstable and...well...I hope you read the death clause in your contract...as we are not responsible for any major\u00a0injuries you incur during you time here at Phylolabs.</p>\n<p>The way the device is set up the controls should be pretty intuitive and we believe you'll be able to learn them quite quickly once you start a splicing session.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alpha Testing and Feedback</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The Phylosplicer is currently in it's alpha phase of testing so we are looking for\u00a0feedback on the following:</p>\n<ul><li>How well the user can learn the controls</li><li>How difficult, easy the gameplay is</li><li>Any major bugs or issues that occur</li><li>Overall flow and feel of the gameplay</li></ul>\n<p>We've set up a forum here on itch.io for you to give us this much needed feedback so that we may further improve on this device and eventually find a cure for these good phylofolk. You can access it by clicking on the \"join the community\" button below this decription.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Once again, welcome to the team and we look forward to having you working with us at Phylolabs!</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Fiona Friskee</p>\n<p>Head Lab Assistant at Phylolabs</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T08:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4d/f4daf60b070864abd5d6e70d535542eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phylofolk"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
