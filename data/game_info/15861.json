The game is one of the few that allow the player to assume the role of a Sith disciple, although you will eventually have to choose between the light and dark side of the Force. The protagonist is Starkiller (a reference to the early draft version of Skywalker), the secret padawan of Darth Vader himself. The young apprentice is tasked with hunting down and killing the few remaining Jedi Knights. He will travel to various planets of the galaxy far, far away and fight Jedi and rebels using his lightsaber and special Force abilities, such as telekinesis and force choking. Both types of attacks can be used to form combo movements. Defeating enemies earns Starkiller experience points that can be used to level up his skills.<br />\nUltimate Sith Edition includes three additional levels: two DLC missions set on Tatooine and Coruscant and a previously unreleased level set on Hoth. The Tatooine mission starts the Infinities plotline, which follows the non-canon \u201cdark\u201d ending of the original game. The Hoth mission concludes it and sets you up against the famous Luke Skywalker.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2009-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-07T05:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b2d/b2db4496b084b235742cf6e9894bbf36.jpg", "website": "http://www.theforceunleashed.com", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 137, "owned": 2447, "beaten": 389, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 85, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 363, "suggestions_count": 498, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 368, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Aspyr Media", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Aspyr", "Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
