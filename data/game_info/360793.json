This is my third year participating in the GMTK Jam, thanks for checking out my entry!<br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay for this game (\"only one\" gun) was inspired in part by Hockey games of all things<br/>The rules are simple, you have a few guys on screen and you need to take out the enemies.<br/>Each guy can shoot 3 times with left click before throwing the gun again with right click.</p>\n<p>Pro tips:<br/>Skeleton enemies can be stunned by a gun throw, which would pass right through a ghoul<br/>The bullets from the gun does damage, but so does the blast from the barrel!
