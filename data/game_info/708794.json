One day, the villagers were attacked by the wild boars while picking up herbs near the edge of the forest. The chief of the village is looking for a person who is familiar with the local map and brave enough to go deeper into the jungle to investigate what caused the animals that normally live deep inside the jungle to panic and attack people on sight. The Blacksmith takes on the role and starts his journey outside of his workshop. Once deep inside the jungle, the Blacksmith encounters a giant King Boar - the one that scares the smaller boars away. The Blacksmith will defeat the King Boar and bring peace back to the village once again.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong></p>\n<p>Thong Huynh -\u00a0Artist, Programmer, SFX &amp; Ambient Sound Designer<br/>(all sounds come from my mouth if you wonder)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:54:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb05d037eee3624cc87b38fb313ed294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thong-Huynh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
