Pick up powerful items and use them to wreak havoc.<br/></li><li>Throw things at your friends. Then trash talk them with taunts and emotes!<br/></li><li>Eat some pie and unleash powerful abilities to turn your enemies into mush!<br/></li><li>The levels are riddled with screamingly unnecessary explosive dangers. Use them to your advantage!</li></ul><br/>Lore<br/><br/>\"Battlements gaze down from the mountain above the once mighty city of Brimstone - now obscured from sight. The era of enlightenment that had once fuelled new innovations and scientific discoveries has now turned to time of onslaught from a new industrial age.<br/><br/>Haze smothers the city, the canals are clogged with putrid filth and the citizens are reeling with fear. For those not struck down by illness or devoured by the grinding teeth of machinery, there is little hope. From within the shadows, a more sinister evil stirs.<br/><br/>Grotesque scenes of supernatural happenings are emerging, leading to rumours from the already trembling people. Glimpses of ghastly figures in the shadows, monsters roaming the streets and dark powers dwelling in the citadel.<br/><br/>Adding fuel to the inferno of misfortune, deep within the bowels of the city there are whispers of a new discovery - a haunting, corrupting, sulfuric substance, known only as plague fire.<br/><br/>With terror around every corner, the civilisation teeters on the brink of chaos. While some search for ways to benefit from the recent turmoil, hunters and healers of ageing ideals have entered the streets seeking to purge the city of evil. With most citizens in hiding, confronting those still walking the streets will often lead to all out brawls.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T17:04:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b2989d5b1e99c26813d007d211844c36.jpg", "website": "http://brimstonebrawlers.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 428, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ategig"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ategig"], "esrb_rating": null}
