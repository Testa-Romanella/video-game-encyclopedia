Controlling bizarre gravity powers to draw in its prey, assist the frog in satisfying its hunger in a never-ending struggle for survival. Tilt your device to manipulate gravity and guide space bugs into range, then slurp them up with a very long tongue, all the while making sure to avoid consuming any of the hazardous objects that are also drawn to the frog.<br/>____________________________<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>-110+ levels of bug-slurping, hazard-dodging action!<br/>-Tilt your device to send space objects in any direction you please. The more you tilt, the faster they go!<br/>-Move the frog with a single finger. It follows your touch as your finger runs along the screen.<br/>-Tap anywhere on the screen to use the frog's long tongue to catch every bug in its path, then slurp them all up!<br/>-Avoid colliding with or swallowing any inedible and other seriously harmful objects you find. Hazards abound!<br/>-Interact with and avoid a diverse range of objects, with more spectacular threats as you progress through the game.<br/>-Think quick, but avoid being rash, else you might end up eating more asteroids than you can chew (and also comets, and satellites, and worse).<br/>-Compete with other players to get the highest score on the Game Center Leaderboard!<br/>____________________________<br/><br/>Need support?
