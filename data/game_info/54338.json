You&#39;re playing 1080 (Ten Eighty) Snowboarding, a game so intense you&#39;ll be brushing the snow off your goggles. With five different boarders, eight different Lamar snowboards, more than 25 tricks, a Half-Pipe and six different courses, this is as close as you&#39;ll get to the real thing without hopping on the next ski lift.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T12:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/84b/84b12cb8af0d29ea0a30f9cea3a15bb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 15, "beaten": 35, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 31, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
