You can follow our up-to-the-minute progress in our public Trello production board, posted in the Steam forums. The scenario for the Primoid is as follows:<br/><br/>After your space yacht undergoes an irksome Rapid Unplanned Disassembly, you find yourself marooned on a large planetoid outside the orbit of Mars. To overcome this interplanetary Robinson Crusoe scenario, you need to use your Atomizer and Assembler tools to gather local resources and turn them into various vehicles, contraptions, and even backup bodies for yourself and your friends!<br/><br/>Explore, survive, and ultimately build a resource-intensive spacecraft to escape the dangers and mysterious caves of this circular world. Onto the next uncharted Planetoid for a completely different adventure - built by us or anyone in the Contributor Community!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-10T19:36:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32c49ab27e9aa2f64ac1348490e2b7f5.jpg", "website": "http://www.planetoidpioneers.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 48, "toplay": 3, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 443, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Data Realms"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Data Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
