More dextrous individuals can attempt this game with fewer players, but it is not recommended.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Read on for details. The short version:</p>\n<ul><li>Moving the mouse will move the targeting reticle</li><li>Typing a key will fire a letter</li><li>Alternate between the\u00a0<em>numpad</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>arrow keys</em>\u00a0to move</li></ul>\n<p>Objective</p>\n<p>You control a light in the sky, shining upon the world. The objective of the game is to keep your light shining for as long as possible.</p>\n<ul><li>Hitting CLOUDS\u00a0will cause your light to dim greatly. You can't afford to hit many.</li><li>Hitting STARS\u00a0will cause your light to dim very slightly.</li></ul>\n<p>You can gain score by destroying\u00a0<em>clouds</em>. Destroying\u00a0<em>clouds</em>\u00a0is also recommended to for survival.</p>\n<p>Moving</p>\n<p>Moving is essential. You primarily move to avoid getting hit. Movement is done by alternating keypresses between the\u00a0<em>numpad</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>arrow keys</em>. You only can move a short distance per keypress. Mashing of keys is highly encouraged!</p>\n<p>For example, in order to move up, you must alternate between pressing the\u00a0<em>up arrow key</em>\u00a0and the\u00a0<em>numpad up key</em>.\u00a0<strong>Note that NumLock must be turned on.</strong></p>\n<p>Destroying Clouds</p>\n<p>Typing a letter will cause a letter to fly towards your targeting reticle. The correct letters must hit a cloud in the correct order for the cloud to be marked.</p>\n<p>Once all the letters in a section of a cloud are marked, that section can be right-clicked. Right-clicked sections will turn transcluscent to indicate that they are destroyed, and can be safely moved through.</p>\n<p>Right-clicking all the segments of a cloud will cause it to be destroyed, earning you points.</p>\n<p>Bad things happening</p>\n<p>Targeting reticles, letters you fire, and even yourself, can temporarily get slower. In general, making a mistake in one aspect of the game will cause other aspects to be more difficult. For example, letting the wrong letter run into a cloud will cause you to move slower. These slowdowns can happen by:</p>\n<ul><li>Failing to alternate keyboard presses (e.g. pressing the arrow keys twice in a row)</li><li>Colliding into a star or cloud</li><li>Having the wrong letter collide with a cloud</li></ul>\n<p>Having too many slowdowns happen too quickly can cause you to move in the opposite direction!</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by the verse\u00a0<strong>Ephesians 4:32</strong></p>\r\n\u00a0Be kind and compassionate to one another,\u00a0forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.\r\n<p>Music and SFX - previous project</p>\n<p>Font - Soft\u00a0Marshmallow from dafont.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T04:33:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/616/616fd9479c5d666d0a9d21069f285f2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sarriest", "AnthonyMoh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
