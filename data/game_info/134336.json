So it is your duty to fight with other player to be the biggest empire before you run out of place.</p> Claim territories, Build your empire, Gather natural ressources and fight with your friend for world control ! Note : Not yet tested so it's definitely unbalanced but i think i'll update that game later when I have the time. Controls : <p>Mouse for interacting with the world</p><p>Arrow key to move around the planet</p><p>While it's a Ludum Dare game, i'm happy with the result and i might try to make a better version of it in the future, as well as balance this version of the game and an AI if i have the time ;)  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d10/d108725880739a271909fa25c9b7c405.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Kavehes"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
