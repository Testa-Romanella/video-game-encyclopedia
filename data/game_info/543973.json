The limitation for the jam was to combine 2 genres. Here I have put together the classic Breakout arcade with a top-down shooter.\u00a0 The game is posted in a prototype stage with only 1 level.</p>\n\n<p>How to play -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use A and D to move the paddle back and forth to keep the shooter from falling into the darkness. Left click on monsters to shoot them. Don't let the monsters touch you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I have plans to improve on this project and add some levels. Your feedback and suggestions will be greatly appreciated and this is the first game I have even released on Itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T08:24:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86d/86d58b0e00b5f1f52f65cd9fc575a815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clonethirteen"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
