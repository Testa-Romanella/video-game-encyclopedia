The goal is to keep dodging and keep yourself on screen, all the while everything is getting more difficult to oversee with a sense of hecticness.</p><p>In theory it takes a maximum of 5 minutes to finish this game. There is only one level and this level takes that long. Can you beat Vitare in 5 minutes? If you can, I'm very impressed, in which case you're obviously the better gamer!</p><p>Do not expect too much, I've decided to publish it anyway simply because I thought it was quite fun to play afterward, but I may of course be delusional after playing it myself for so many times while testing it!</p><p>Any bugs, hints or tips? Comment and I'll try to fix it! Or tweeting @caelesticode is also a possibility :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df346135d3702ef80bdc019c14681f05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["caelesticode"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
