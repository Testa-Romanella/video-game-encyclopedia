It can also change direction (use the touchscreen button on the left, the left arrow key on PC/Mac).</p><p>Mice are always hungry. This one will need a whole lot of cheese. Feed it and it will run faster. Let it starve and it will fall asleep.</p><p>Source code is available on Github.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/106f085c901320e519336ca729129cd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["RodZilla"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
