We've been playing them for decades, and we love them - so we're making one. Combining our favourite elements of everything that came before, we hope to mix it up into something deeply entertaining.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we've drawn on film noir for the story's inspiration, we're leaning much more towards the comedy side of \"comedy-noir\". Expect some serious topics, addressed seriously - but we don't want to burden the whole game down under the weight of unrelenting grittiness. We feel that there's enough of that in the world already.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFun comes first, and we aim to be funny before all else, with comedy inspired by the likes of Taika Waititi. We strive for humour that anyone can appreciate, and writing that won't force you to mute your speakers when playing in public. So snuggle up with your favourite floofball and discover Nine Noir Lives!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T19:14:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbba79db3e7b60b2f2279b029be175c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 41}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Silvernode Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Silvernode Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
