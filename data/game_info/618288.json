You can complete the level by getting both characters to go to the computers then the correct microphones then interacting as intended.\u00a0However the blue character door does not open. To complete the level you must do all this then get the yellow character to their door and interact.</p><p>Sorry for the issue guys.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faad3dc9907f09f47cf577bfd534ef10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lone Rabbit", "EsiX", "HmmDeveloped"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
