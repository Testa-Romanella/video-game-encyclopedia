left the world devestated and created an apocalyptic climate disaster</p>\n<p>The only way humanity could survive was to create giant power spheres around the world to protect themselves</p>\n<p>For a while, the peace lasted, but then the old feelings of mistrust between East and West re-emerged</p>\n<p>Once again, the world was thrown into conflict .....</p>\n<p>It is your role as Commander to use your power and defeat the enemy</p>\n<p>On loading you will be presented with a screen of options</p>\n<p>OPTIONS SCREEN:</p>\n<p>Play, this will take you to the main game screen</p>\n<p>Difficulty, allows you to make the game more easy or more difficult to win</p>\n<p>New game, select Western, Eastern or Random Alliance to generate friendly, neutral and enemy countries</p>\n<p>Load Game, load a previously saved game</p>\n<p>Save Game, save a game you are currently playing</p>\n<p>Turn time, set to None for turn based mode, or set a time between 1 (fastest) and 10 (slowest) for RTS type game</p>\n<p>Guide brings up this guide again</p>\n<p>Sound option, to increase, decrease or stop the game sound effects</p>\n<p>Quit the game and accept defeat</p>\n<p>In the middle of the screen is a spinning world</p>\n<p>Each side of the world are gold rotate arrows to pause the spinning and rotate the world slower</p>\n<p>Underneath is a gold rotate arrows to view the full game screen map and the sphere alliances</p>\n<p>To return to the spinning world touch again</p>\n<p>Touch the World to start the main game screen or press Play</p>\n<p>MAIN GAME SCREEN</p>\n<p>The main game screen has the following indicators and controls</p>\n<p>A Build Icon to enable you to build additional units in friendly spheres</p>\n<p>A world map Icon to enable you to return to the options screen</p>\n<p>A time and day indicator</p>\n<p>In normal turn based non timer mode touch the time indicator to advance the time by 1 hour</p>\n<p>In RTS type game the time will update automatically, to pause and unpause the time update, touch the time icon</p>\n<p>At 21:00, the day will end and additional units will automatically be created, and additional power added to each sphere</p>\n<p>Two information bars are in the lower centre of the screen</p>\n<p>Touch the \"End the current day\" bar to end the current day and progress quicker</p>\n<p>To the right is a \"Harness Power\" control, to enable you to harness all friendly sphere power levels</p>\n<p>These will be added to your level of power indicated in the bar below this control</p>\n<p>Be careful however, as friendly spheres without power can be more easily converted later on in the game</p>\n<p>You must first place your Capitol city in a friendly sphere before the game can start</p>\n<p>Touch the world map to scroll around the world</p>\n<p>Use this to view friendly spheres (blue), neutral spheres (green) and enemy spheres (red)</p>\n<p>When your target cursor enters a sphere, details of the sphere will be displayed and Options you can control</p>\n<p>Each sphere has:</p>\n<p>A regional name</p>\n<p>A current level of power</p>\n<p>A maximum level of power</p>\n<p>A daily charge level of power (this charge is added to the current level of power at the end of each day)</p>\n<p>An industry to create new unit types each day as follows:</p>\n<p>Armoured Units, Mechanized Units, Special Forces, Repair Units, Snipers</p>\n<p>You can control neutral spheres by Converting them to friendly, Guarding them with a unit, or investing in them</p>\n<p>Each controlling action will add three hours to the day clock</p>\n<p>Converting a sphere will enable you to harness its power and build units in the sphere</p>\n<p>Investing in them makes it less likely that your enemy will convert them for their own use</p>\n<p>You can convert an enemy sphere into a neutral sphere, but it will lose all its power</p>\n<p>To convert this sphere into a friend you will then need to invest power into it first</p>\n<p>All of the above uses certain amounts of your power so be careful you don't go negative and lose the game</p>\n<p>Using the Build option in a friendly sphere will enable you to build additional units.</p><p>\u00a0These include:</p>\n<p>Factories in which you can invest to add more fire power and hull strength to your next unit build</p>\n<p>Power Plants, which will add an additional 1000 power to your own power at the end of each day</p>\n<p>To protect the above from the enemy you can also build Bunkers and Pill boxes</p>\n<p>Bunkers target Armour and Mechanized units</p>\n<p>Pillboxes target Special Forces and Militia</p>\n<p>These are fixed units which cannot be moved so are good to defend factories and Power Plants</p>\n<p>Building any unit will advance the day time by 1 hour and all units will respond and engage if within range</p>\n<p>Selecting a factory will enable you to chose either Fire Power or Hull Strength upgrade mode</p>\n<p>You can then select the unit type to upgrade and use part of your power to upgrade the unit up to its maximum value</p>\n<p>The next unit builds will then be built to these levels of fire power or hull strength</p>\n<p>Greater fire power will enable you to destroy the enemy more quickly</p>\n<p>Greater hull strength will enable your unit to absorb more hits from the enemy</p>\n<p>Touching a friendly unit will allow you the option to set it to Guard its position, or roam around to find the enemy</p>\n<p>Touching an enemy unit will let you know which of your units it can target as follows:</p>\n<p>Assassins target your capitol (reducing your power) and your snipers</p>\n<p>Special Forces target your Capitol (reducing your power) and your Specials\u00a0</p>\n<p>Militia targets your snipers and mechanized units</p>\n<p>Mechy units target your armd and mechanized units</p>\n<p>Armour targets your buildings, and your armd units</p>\n<p>Each day the enemy will be building units, upgrading units, and trying to convert neutrals to be enemies, and eventually will convert your friendly spheres</p>\n<p>If the enemy converts all spheres to enemy, the game will be lost and you will have been defeated</p>\n<p>If you lose all your power by the end of a day, the game will also be lost</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated":
