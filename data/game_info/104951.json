The planet is no longer inhabitable. The remnants of humanity are scattered on 5 space stations on the fringe of the solar system, where some of the best scientists are conducting experiments in pursuit of a \"cure\" that grants immunity to the Earth's harsh environment so humanity can once again return to their homeworld.</p>\n<p> You play as an experienced scientist who was just employed by an organization called A.R.K. A new spot recently opened up at one of their labs and you jump on the opportunity - but something is amiss. After a few weeks of working closely with some key members of the research facility, you begin to uncover the dark secrets hidden away in the depths of the station.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Gareth Hudson - SFX and Script<br/></p>\n<p>Kristy Lin - Background Art and Script</p>\n<p>Reilly MacKay - Character Art</p>\n<p>Sanaa Memon - SFX, Script, UI</p>\n<p>Yinting He - Programming and Script</p>\n\n<p><strong>Music credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p> http://www.purple-planet.com<br/></p>\n\n<p>-Sheridan Game Labs-</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8b/d8b12b24d2d945c4530ecb2181abcc38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sanaa M."], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
