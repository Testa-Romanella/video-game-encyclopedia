However, your dice get worn down from the action and eventually need to rest up.</p>\n<p>Each time a die lands on a result, the <strong>wear</strong> causes that result to become more likely in subsequent rolls.<br/></p>\n<p>Dice can be sent to <strong>training</strong>, where they receive less <strong>wear</strong> but don't risk losing you a wager.</p>\n<p>Dice can also <strong>rest</strong>, which removes some of the <strong>wear</strong>.</p>\n<p>If a die is completely worn down,\u00a0it shatters and is lost forever.<br/></p>\n<p>If your money\u00a0goes below 0 credits, that's game over.</p>\n<p>How long can you last in this endless game?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Click and drag dice between the four areas (Shop, Fight, Train, Rest).<br/>Click the\u00a0<strong>Next Day</strong> button to advance and see the result of the fight.</p>\n\n<p><em>Made during GMTK Game Jam 2022 (theme: \"roll of the dice\").</em><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game Design and Programming:</strong><br/>Zereijin</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sound, Music &amp; Graphics:</strong><br/>FydaTECH<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Game engine:</strong><br/>Godot 3.4.4</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Music and sound effects\u00a0created with:</strong><br/>FL Studio 20<br/>YMCK Magical 8bit Plug 2\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Art created with:</strong><br/>Aseprite</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T18:04:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70d/70dd0c3c9c1d21dfdc019919f08d1a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Fyda", "Zereijin"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
