He informs you that you have been sleeping for hours, and he barely managed to save the ship from crashing into an unknown planet.\u00a0 You must now return to your loved ones in earth.</p>\n<p>It isn't that easy though. You see, at this part of space big objects exist, with gravitational forces than can cause distortions in spacetime. This means that by getting close to them, time passes faster for the people on earth than it does for you. The same thing is observed when driving your ship, because it is capable of reaching speeds close to that of light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the phenomenon of \"Gravity Assistance\" can speed boost your spaceship when exiting the orbit of a planet.\u00a0Your goal is to travel to earth, without causing such a big distortion that your returning becomes meaningless. Balancing speed with time is crucial. Will you make it home, Commander?</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Each time you play the game, you are randomly assigned one of the random spawn points on the map, as well as one of the 4 available original soundtracks. Make sure to play the game a lot of times! Surprises are always there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse to set movement direction.</p>\n<p>Left click to increase speed.</p>\n<p>Right click to decrease speed.</p>\n<p>ESC to open pause menu.</p>\n<p>ENTER to continue dialog.</p>\n\n<p>Made by a group of friends from Greece for the Extra Credits Game Jam #5.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0George Tsakonas</p>\n<p><strong>Art:</strong>\u00a0John Miaris</p>\n<p><strong>Music &amp; SFX:\u00a0</strong>George Soulantikas (TWEL)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T05:59:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/210/21083aa10737d937cce362aae35d7b98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["geotsak", "TWEL"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
