But the traffic hasn't been stopped. You'll just have to work around them I\u00a0guess. Don't worry if a few innocents end up\u00a0in the water in the process. I'm almost entirely sure they can swim.</p>\n<ul><li>Controls are all on an XBox controller, and are shown\u00a0in game.</li><li>Features 6 incredibly detailed\u00a0challenging levels.</li><li>No winching the cars to the goal. Your mum didn't raise you to be a cheat!</li><li>Built by a team of one, in about a day and a half. For the GMTK Games Jam.</li></ul>\n<p>No need to complete levels if you don't want to. You can skip back and forth as much as you like.</p>\n<p>I raided lots of my old Flash projects for sound effects. Graphics are a mix of unique assets built in ProBuilder during the jam, and a few free assets from the Asset Store. Mainly Broken Vector's low poly car pack. Although the code to make them run around was all written in the jam. I've also used RayFire, which is a paid plugin I\u00a0own from a different project. I've probably missed some attribution stuff. It's hard enough to keep track when you're working on a full project, let alone in a rushed games jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c9/1c9b2568bb7de0dbf3e6e972cf5aca93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Deeperbeige"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
