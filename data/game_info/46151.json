Those who enjoy seeing just how far they can make it down a never-ending tunnel will find an exorbitant amount of replay value here. If you fit into this category, then this game should be on your iPhone.\"<br/>-theportablegamer.com<br/><br/>\"Putki is a fun little reaction based tunnel game. In a nutshell, all you do is fly through a never ending tunnel and dodge the oncoming obstacles. This is strictly an accelerometer based game so you wont be needing all your fingers for those pesky virtual buttons. As you fly down the tunnel the game treats you to a bit of a psychedelic overload all while blasting out a thumping techno beat.\"<br/><br/>\"Fun, fun, fun!!!
