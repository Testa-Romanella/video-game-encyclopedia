Help him escape by\u00a0<em>destroying everything in his path. </em>Bounce the ball around to wreck computers and get points.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong><br/>Stomp the ball to send it upwards. Gently bash it to send it rolling. Sometimes waiting for the ball to settle is best. There's a time limit, but you're not penalized for taking too long.
