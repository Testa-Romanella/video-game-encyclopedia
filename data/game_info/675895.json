Theme: <strong>Unstable!\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>You are an unstable psychopath hell bent on killing ALL the Tangerinos! Don\u2019t let them stop you, or take down as many of them as you can before they stop you! You\u2019re not the only thing that\u2019s unstable. The floors are too!\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WSAD</strong>\u00a0- Move\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong>\u00a0- Aim\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Left Click</strong>\u00a0- Attack\r\n</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>1. Chop the Tangerines for points!</p>\n\n<p>2. The Tangerines will throw apples at you in the hopes of thwarting your rampage. However, a well timed attack on an incoming apple will\u00a0<strong>DEFLECT</strong>\u00a0it back at the Tangerine! Mastering this is the key to a high score!</p>\n\n<p>3. Moving around will crack and eventually crumble the unstable ground. Destroying the field will also give you points! But be careful, if you destroy too much of the field, it will be harder to move around and make you vulnerable to the Tangerine assault!</p>\n<p>Have fun and comment below your high score! The developer high score is\u00a0<strong>814.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nChangelog\r\n<p>[6 Oct 2021]\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fix extremely low fps on some devices\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>[5 Oct 2021]\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Initial release\r\n</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Programming and Art:</strong>\u00a0https://twitter.com/swineyX\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Programming and Art:</strong>\u00a0https://twitter.com/arvz88\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Made with Unity, Maya, Blender.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:56:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/90e/90e6eb67c9ca074c43e6de6342d4aea3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arvz", "swiney"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
