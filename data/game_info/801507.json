I\u00a0use simple concepts. This series is aimed at beginners but does assume you have some type of idea.\u00a0<br/>You can watch the video streams here\u00a0https://tinyurl.com/p101-lmag<br/></p>\n<p>You can download the source code for each episode here by reading the comments under the videos.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to learn Amiga Assembly from scratch I\u00a0have another series which is called The Complete Amiga Assembly Course. This goes in detail and you will need to have patience since it starts very slow but as you go along your knowledge will grow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is the link to this series\u00a0https://tinyurl.com/A68K-ENG</p>\n<p>If you need any help please get in touch with me on Discord that is the best medium for me. Here is the link\u00a0 to all my social media\u00a0https://linktr.ee/phaze101<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important Note</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that this series has 16 Episodes but in the following weeks I will be releasing the remaining episodes. All supporters have access to the these including the source code.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Enhancements\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Note also that although the series is finished I am still enhancing it and the final version of it will be released here. So consider the last stage of it as still in development.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Survive by avoiding obstacles by staying to the left, middle or to the right while falling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0You have 3 positions</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0attached to left wall</li><li>\u00a0In Air in the middle</li><li>\u00a0Holding to the Right wall.\u00a0</li></ol>\n<p>In the middle you can't stay there for long. If you do you will die.</p>\n<p>There are 2 bars. One is your energy and the other one is your depth meter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Touching any object decreases your energy and the further down you go the more obstacles to avoid but also your score will increase per object you avoid.</p>\n<p>Game ends when you lose all your energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>\n<p>Two Options</p>\n<p>1. Hard disk Install -\u00a0Download the file, copy it to your Amga Hard Disk and run it from your Amiga.</p>\n<p>2.
