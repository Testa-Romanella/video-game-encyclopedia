The player finds themselves in the consciousness of Skye Lockwood, a woman taking a retrospective look into her memories of her high school relationship with her roommate at their all-girls boarding school Greybrook Academy. Players walk through Skye's dorm room and interact with the various objects scattered around the room. Doing so, they recover short audio scenes depicting memories attached to Skye and her girlfriend Olivia's possessions in the room.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0want to invite the player to think about missed opportunity, regrets, closure, acceptance, and letting go. Players will see how Skye and Olivia had a beautiful but short-lived relationship as Skye's inevitable graduation draws nearer and nearer. Throughout the game, the tension builds as Skye and Olivia fall in love and try to determine the fate of their relationship. They will inevitably go their separate ways at the end of the year when Skye graduates and Olivia is left to complete two more years of high school. The game's ending is characterized by a somber emptiness as the girls distance themselves from each other and Skye realizes that if she truly loves Olivia, she must let her go.</p>\n<p>By the end, the audience realizes that they are Skye, now in a place of retrospection and reflection on this era of her life. Skye realizes that though she loved and lost and never fully realized the potential of her relationship with Olivia she must now come to terms with and accept that fact. I want the player to leave with the feeling that what Skye had with Olivia was real and good despite its short life and somber ending.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/353/35333b179897ad39579b9f457ac025d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["katesmith"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
