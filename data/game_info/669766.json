That's why I'm the winner of this Game Jam :D\r\n\r\nPurpose of the game: When the computer gives us a signs of life (the green light), we turn on the computer by pressing the white button (starting the computer).\u00a0\r\n\r\nThen we start the game. If we destroy all the enemies, we win the game and go to the next level. If we can't kill the enemies and the computer is down time, the game is paused and the next boot time is awaited. If you miss a unlock time, the game will reset and you will have to start over! So be careful!\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nBy the way, controls are very basic, just move, jump and shoot!\r\n\r\nAnd if you have any feedback, you would make me happy and improve it by commenting here!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T04:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85a/85a9d0a62c994c48e57c4f202a35f999.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["frkn.cs"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
