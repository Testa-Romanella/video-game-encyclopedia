Without her presence in the sky, the balance between day and night is now disrupted and Solveig, her sister and goddess of the sun, is now alone to oversee the world. Without Aysu by her side, the warmth of her sunshine has weakened, slowly plunging the world into a glacial era. Aysu, lost without any means of communication with her old kingdom, learns to survive in a world that despises her. <br/><br/>Aysu is eventually found by her sister. However their consolation is sadly brief, as  the Goddess of the Night is now too weak to rejoin Solveig in the sky and restore the balance. Worse, without her powers, the shadows are her only safe haven against the very sunrays her sister's casting on the world!<br/><br/>To restore themselves and the world, the two siblings must embark on a perilous journey to search for the missing shards of Aysu\u2019s celestial body that were scattered throughout the snowy plains and the frozen oceans of a never-sleeping world.<h3>Feature list</h3><ul><li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Navigating the game relies heavily on the shadows cast by the environment. The player controlling Solveig can change the time of day and thus altering the angles and lengths of these shadows. This has the effect of creating new paths for Aysu and gives access to places that Solveig didn\u2019t have access to.<br/></li><li><strong>Solar Energy</strong>: Solar energy is used throughout the game to power and activates specific elements to solve puzzles. Solveig can interact with those elements if they are in the sunlight through her ability of focused beam.<br/></li><li><strong>Wind Power</strong>: Aysu, her, cannot activate the solar-powered elements, but can still interact with them - and other elements, such as enemies -  by pushing them with her wind powers.<br/></li><li><strong>Agenda</strong>: Changing the time of the day does not only modify the shadows; it also affects the world in several ways:<br/><ul><li>Enemies will act differently depending on the time of the day.<br/></li><li>It will transform the environment accordingly to the players\u2019 actions. For instance, a wall of ice blocking the path that the players got rid of at noon will most likely be still intact if Solveig goes back to the early hours of the day.</li></ul></li></ul><br/><strong>NOTE: This game is only available in coop.
