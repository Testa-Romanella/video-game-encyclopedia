You do, however, get to take pride in knowledge that you are the champion!<br/></p>\n<p>The format? One player controls a nimble car, with the ability to turn invisible\u00a0and lay traps. They must collect as many Point Orbs as possible to end the round.</p>\n<p>The other player controls a heftier vehicle equipped with a big old boulder catapult and a system-disabling EMP cannon.\u00a0They must use their tools to prevent the other player from collecting orbs through cold-blooded car murder.</p>\n<p>Switch roles, rinse and repeat, the player with the most Point Orbs wins!</p>\n<p>Grab a friend, it's fun!</p>\n<p>We are students from Falmouth University Games Academy. We worked really hard on this and we hope it brings you some joy! :)</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Abigail Salter - <em>2D Concept Art, UI Design</em></li><li>Alessio Acampora - <em>Programmer</em></li><li>Andreea-Cristiana Papuc - <em>2D and 3D\u00a0</em><em>Environment Art</em></li><li>Christopher Katunda - <em>Art, 3D Assets</em></li><li>James Spencer - <em>2D Textures, Animated Textures, Particle Effects<br/></em></li><li>James Moyse - <em>Team Leader,</em>\u00a0\u00a0<em>Design, Programming, User Experience</em></li><li>Lachlainn Hayes - <em>Rigging, UI Animation</em></li><li>Robert Doman - <em>Vehicle and Environment, 3D Art, 2D textures</em></li><li>Louis Dyster-Pearson -<em> Design, Sound</em></li><li>Dovydas Asinovicius - <em>Tutorial Design</em></li><li>Roberts Ikaunieks - <em>Writing<br/></em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Music\u00a0Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Title Screen:<em> Factory on Mercury,\u00a0</em>Eric Matyas</li><li>Main Game: <em>Action Chase Music</em>,\u00a0Alex Lisi\u00a0</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T04:49:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57ba9fc755886f11e5989682def9aa5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MothTrap Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
