{"id": 13559, "slug": "puzzle-cube", "name": "Puzzle Cube", "name_original": "Puzzle Cube", "description": "Puzzle Cube was initially developed as a game jam entry for the theme \"Life in 2 Dimensions\". It provides a variation on the challenge of solving the 3x3 cube, by limiting the view of the 3D cube to a 2D perspective and limiting the controls somewhat. The cube can be manipulated to any of the possible configurations that a Rubik's Cube* can.<br/><br/>This current version of Puzzle Cube has been developed and is being published as a resume piece. Because of this, it will always be free! With enough interest, development will continue, adding more features to the game.<h3>FEATURES</h3><br/><ul><li> Online Leaderboards<br/></li><li> Various Music, Background, &amp; Cube Skin settings<br/></li><li> The timer can be disabled (must return to the main menu to re-enable it)<br/></li><li> Tutorial Video Link for learning to solve the cube<br/></li><li> Keyboard &amp; Controller support (tested w/XBox One Controller)</li></ul><br/><br/>* Puzzle Cube is not associated with or endorsed by Rubik's Cube.
