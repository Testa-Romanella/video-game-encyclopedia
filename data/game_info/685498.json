Well, I don't care because you are going to play this game anyway. In this roughly 10-15 minute game, you will feel joy, hardship, sorrow, sexual arousal, and everything in-between.</p>\n<p>In this game you play as Marisa Kirisame, a famed main character of Touhou Project. One uneventful day in the Forest of Magic, Marisa discovers a new type of mushroom that she has never encountered before! Upon eating this mushroom, her spirit becomes metaphorically rock hard and she is never the same again. She must go on a journey to find more of these mysterious mushrooms to satiate her craving for more four-dimensional experiences.</p>\n<p>Gameplay features a combination of <strong>platformer</strong> stages with a Touhou style <strong>danmaku/bullet hell</strong> bosses (don't worry, it's not that hard). Arcade style, meant to be played in one sitting.\u00a0Minor but insignificant bugs might appear.\u00a0Avoid explosive fumos nefariously created by the CCP, jump over yukkuri pits, dodge fairies and ying-yang orbs, find collectibles, and more await you in the game! Soundtrack is composed of many chiptune style remixes of some classic Touhou songs remixed by yours truly.</p>\n<p>Here are some reviews:</p>\n<p>\"I'm still addicted to crack but that girl with the blue hair is funny.\"</p>\n<p>- Homeless Man</p>\n<p>\"ramaseta, famous member of the Nya Guys, has really outdone himself this time with this game. The game's message is just a really good message to spread and is just an overall great game in general. I've never played Touhou before but I'm sure this game sums it up pretty well.\"</p>\n<p>- Anonymous</p>\n<p>\"The bullet hell bosses aren't particularly impressive and the platformer segments are just stupid.\"</p>\n<p>- Asshole</p>\n<p>\"\u5927\u5bb6\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u6d2a\u7f8e\u73b2\u3002\u6211\u53ea\u60f3\u8bf4\uff0c\"\u739b\u4e3d\u838e\u5403\u8611\u83c7\u55d1\u836f \"\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u6700\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u662f\u7535\u5b50\u6e38\u620f\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002\"</p>\n<p>- Hong Meiling</p>\n<p><strong>Meiling seal of approval!
