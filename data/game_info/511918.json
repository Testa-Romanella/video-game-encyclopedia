Since I'm still a beginner, I figure I should start out\u00a0making the simple stuff. This game is largely based off a popular game I'm sure you're familiar with, so the gameplay should immediately be familiar to you. The big hurdle i had was getting the Asteroids to spawn properly. So pardon me if they're a bit off. Other than that, the game could maybe use more time in the oven so I might update it every now and then. but i think its current state is serviceable.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>oh yea and\u00a0Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Credit to:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Figgy - pipe gawd</p>\n<p>HandsomeUnicorn (https://handsomeunicorn.itch.io/) - for the Asteroid sprite.</p>\n<p>Anokolisa (https://anokolisa.itch.io/) - for character sprite</p>\n<p>Craftpix (https://craftpix.net/) - for the space GUI</p>\n<p>Komiku (https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Komiku) - for music</p>\n<p>Valem (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJlesN59MzHPPCp0Lg8sLw) - for helpful tutorials</p>\n<p>GameSupplyGuy (https://itch.io/profile/gamesupply) - for sound effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:40:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b5/8b5f8601a991bad78116fb363a7fcd09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GhostDome"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
