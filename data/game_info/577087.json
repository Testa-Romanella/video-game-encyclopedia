Therefore we thought to make a nice and relaxing atmosphere work in a stylised art style inspired by some examples of older games and animations. In our final concept, water is an essential resource that you need to use to help your flowers grow and keep the water crystal clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plant Pot Hero was a nice break from our current university unit and a lovely change compared to our other projects. All team members put many efforts and souls into this project, bringing it alive and vibrant.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits ------------------------</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ludophobic Llama:\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Development - Niall Colvin &amp; Adam Wood\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Character Modeller -\u00a0Iuliia Rozsa-Bakacsi</p>\n<p>3D Assets - Adam\u00a0\u00a0Wood, Bethany Stacey</p>\n<p>ArtWork - Bethany Stacey\r\n</p>\n<p>Audio - Freesound.org\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T07:38:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd3/fd3e93b323b22bdf6ecef041d8afa197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Niall Colvin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
