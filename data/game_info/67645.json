Burn the Rope is a unique game for the pyro in all of us. All you have to do is feed the fire! <br/><br/>Burn the Rope is a challenging game where you try to burn as much rope as you can in each level. There\u2019s a catch! The fire only burns upwards, leaving you to rotate the puzzle to keep your flame alive! <br/><br/>As you progress through the levels, you\u2019ll encounter bugs crawling along the rope. Different bugs have different reactions to the flame. For example, the ant changes the color of the flame so you can burn different colored ropes, and the spider shoots out a web bridge so you can access parts of the level that you could not before. <br/><br/>Burn the Rope is incredibly fun and addictive. You will actually feel like you\u2019re burning a rope, yet there\u2019s no need for a fire extinguisher! <br/>Features: <br/>\u2022 112 exciting levels with more coming soon! <br/>\u2022 Incredibly fun and addictive! <br/>\u2022 Unique controls ! <br/>\u2022 Beautiful graphics and cool fire effects! <br/>\u2022 Easy to learn, hard to master! <br/>\u2022 Fun for the whole family! <br/><br/>Check the gameplay video: <br/><br/>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGf_SPHNUs", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0af/0af3fbcba04fbeb7677952e6c49cfa55.jpg", "website": "http://www.burntherope.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Big Blue Bubble"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
