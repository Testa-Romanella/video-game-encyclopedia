You are challenged to a gauntlet of puzzles and the only question is: Can you master the pixel grids\u00a0without getting a headache? The challenge is on!</p>\n<p>This is a 16kb Commodore 64 cartridge game, a quick weekend project that might look very familiar. There is no tutorial or manual yet, you can use a joystick or\u00a0W,A,S,D (fire is left shift) to move the pointer, or the cursor keys to step the cursor. Use fire or Space to toggle squares.</p>\n<p>The solution to each puzzle is to put the correct number of blocks for each row and column on the board, as shown in numbers along the edges. When a solution is complete press fire again to move to the next. This is a C64 implementation of a Nonogram puzzle:\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram<br/></p>\n<p>This is a first playable version and may have some bugs, such as no music, I'll look in to that perhaps. Accidentally the game starts on puzzle 2, to start on the first, tap left a couple of times before pressing fire!</p>\n<p>Update: Removed the logo during gameplay (obscured the playfield), moved keyboard fire to CTRL (tab on PC emulators), 35(!) mostly C64 related puzzles, start level is 0 instead of 1, can use keyboard to start/go to next puzzle.</p><p>Older Updates:</p><ul><li>Showing the groupings of pixels instead of just the total number of pixels per row and column</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ed/2eda77452981b98960cd2aa9514972a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sakrac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
