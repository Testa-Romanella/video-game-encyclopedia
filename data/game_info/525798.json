Here, within a kingdom ruled by tyranny, a man discovers the music within us all.<br/><br/>Resonance: Rhythm in You is the first title by the upcoming studio Resonance Games. Follow the story of our nameless Hero as he traverses the town of Zephra, a place that is no stranger to hardship. After stumbling upon a mysterious power, however, the world will unravel into unforgettable quirky characters and beats from a variety of genres.<br/><br/>Engage in Resonance's completely unique musical battle system, inspired by RPG combat systems and driven by the beat. Explore the world, interacting with a variety of characters and get a taste for the narrative-rich world we hope to develop.<br/><br/>We're considering this the 'alpha prototype', an experience that hopes to capture the essence of what Resonance: Rhythm in You hopes to become. We've begun finding people for the team, developing our business model and getting work done on concept art and our eventual pixel-art aesthetic. Please keep in mind that most of the assets in this alpha prototype are placeholder, and meant to give you, the player, a reliable sense of what we are aiming for.<br/><br/>We hope you'll leave a comment with your feedback, and if you're interested, join us on our Facebook group at:<br/> https://www.facebook.com/resonancegamescommunity <br/>or follow Resonance Games' founder on twitter @Trinity_Xtreme (we are currently working to build a Discord community and a website too!).<br/><br/>In a world slipping into the monotony of silence, can you hear the music?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T04:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a61789c87ddb7c7c718a4cb625d960b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Resonance Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
