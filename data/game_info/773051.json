With simple one-button controls, a wonderful soundtrack, and beautiful art, the task of murdering chickens remains one of the most fun tasks around.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>~ ~ ~</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n<br/>Left Click: Interact\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>~ ~ ~</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Explanation:\r\n<br/>My  intention with this jam was to learn how to use Godot, so I decided  that one of the most straightforward ways to stick to the theme and stay  motivated was to remake one of my old games, many of which are  arcade-y, high-score type games. Chiken Chop was my favorite game from  back then, so I decided to remake it into Chicken Chop 2! Chicken Chop 2  differs from the original in that it rewrites literally every system  from scratch, is written in a new engine, and is actually good. I\u2019ve  opted out of ratings since this is basically just the same game from 3  years ago, but just refurbished and ported. Thanks for playing!\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T11:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da6301aec0279a59fac49b5290b7b7b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmCannon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
