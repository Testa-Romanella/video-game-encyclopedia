Minigames that capture the essence of making a complete game. Perform well in each of the <em>Code</em>, <em>Art</em>, <em>Dialogue</em>, <em>Physics</em>, <em>Music</em>, <em>Effects </em>and <em>Debug </em>mingames to result in a higher-graded result game!</li><li>5 rigorous grading categories that indicate the victories and shortcomings of your produced game, and an overall position in the Ludum Dare leaderboard.</li><li>Hyper-realistic energy system - Ludum Dare Simulator 2019 simulates actual fatigue and encourages you to take a short break to recover. A lesson we could all learn from.</li><li>Infinite gameplay - Ludum Dare Simulator 2019 uses a complex Deep Learning algorithm to simulate Ludum Dare jams from the future! /s</li><li>Brilliant soundtrack from Mitch Murder and Waterflame!</li><li>Really bad pixel art (as per usual)!</li><li>4 entire instrument samples!</li><li>A cute robot!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Instructions/Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Once you've entered a Jam, click on any of the Code, Art, Dialogue, Physics, Music, Effects, Break or Final Polish buttons to move to that room.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Code </em>- <strong>Click and drag </strong>instructions to get the robot to its destination tile.</p>\n<p><em>Art </em>- <strong>Click and drag</strong><em> </em>over the canvas to replicate the source image.</p>\n<p><em>Dialogue </em>- <strong>Type </strong>any of the words before they dissapear.</p>\n<p><em>Physics\u00a0</em>- <strong>Move the mouse </strong>to control the racquet and deflect as many balls as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Music </em>- <strong>Use the number keys</strong> to reproduce the drum loop as accurately as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Effects</em> - <strong>Click </strong>on the crosshairs before they disappear.</p>\n<p><em>Break </em>- <strong>Do nothing </strong>while you recharge your Energy meter.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Debug\u00a0</em>- <strong>Click </strong>or\u00a0<strong>press Space </strong>to fire hasty-code-patch bullets at the bugs. <br/></p>\n<p>In some of the games you'll find golden items - interact with these to get an extra second in the <em>Debug</em> minigame.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits </strong>(because I didn't have time to put it in-game)</p>\n<p>Music by Mitch Murder - https://mitchmurder.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Waterflame - https://www.youtube.com/user/waterflame89</p>\n<p>Some sound effects from freesound.org by jacklilley, Soughtaftersounds, cabled_mess, _stubb, Splice Sound, beerre, soundscalpel.com, cgeffex, studiomandragore.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Since we <em>(I) </em>have aimed to produce the most accurate game jam simulation possible, the game can sometimes incur relatively traumatic flashbacks to impending deadlines, spaghetti code, lack of sleep, writer's block, terrible pixel art drawing, bad theme decisions and/or submission website outages.
