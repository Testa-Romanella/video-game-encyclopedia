Select the direction of flight, hold the left mouse button, and start conquering new heights. Remember: despite the fact that the tea fuel is constantly replenished, its amount is limited, so use your opportunities wisely. Otherwise, you will feel the bitterness of falling down and constant loss of progress, as well as utter hopelessness. The game is made in the \u201cOver It\u201d genre, which became popular after the release of \u201cGetting Over It with Bennett Foddy\u201d back in 2017.<br/><br/><ul><li>Challenge yourself to reach the top of the unyielding mountain.</li><li>Journey through the unique map with different locations.</li><li>Prepare your mental health for constant falls.</li><li>Fall over and over again, losing all your hope.</li><li>Accept your fate or keep struggling.</li><li>And finally, feel like a real Flying Kettle.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T02:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47adec2a580664804f0d06f1137dfe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maxkres Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Maxkres Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
