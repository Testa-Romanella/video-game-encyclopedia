Something innovative! </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hektor </strong>is a captivating and honestly challenging match-4 arcade game of the old school and not just another \"match-3-gems-bubbles-candies-or-whatever-to-annoying-music-kind-of-game\"! <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe goal of Hektor is to match 100 tiles each level. Find cross-shaped combinations of at least four pieces in a size-changing, chaotic playing field. Be careful not to click wrongly or you have to collect even more tiles. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe clock is ticking! However, combining three stars in a row will provide you with a time bonus. So, better react quickly and use your bonuses and power-ups wisely if you want to beat your high score. Enjoy infinite, randomly generated levels and a variety of skins. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThis is not the next Bejeweled. But maybe that's a good thing! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHektor has:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Unusual, innovative play principle </li>\n<li>Challenging playing field <br/>\n</li>\n<li>Infinite levels <br/>\n</li>\n<li>Bonuses and power-ups <br/>\n</li>\n<li>Super cool sounds <br/>\n</li>\n<li>A variety of designs <br/>\n</li>\n<li>Lots of love </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fc/6fcfd4dd00e21f65e9eace91b64e325e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Der Schamane"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
