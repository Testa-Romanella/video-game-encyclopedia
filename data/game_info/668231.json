I wanted to use games as a form of art and share the project with others and maybe get in touch with a publisher to release the newest Proteus.</p>\n<p>My goal was to make 3 empty but \u201cinteractive\u201d environments/spaces (voidscapes) with each their own theme. I wanted to get down and dirty on the surroundings and tell 3 separate stories about our environment and nature.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>But during the development of my games, I got really depressed (again) and finally sought out some help, and the overall theme of the voidscapes evolved into empty space and my personal depression. While I can see the beauty of life it has no meaning to me. Beauty, happiness and good times always remind me of the periods where I can\u2019t feel those anymore, where I can\u2019t find the consolation in beauty (and things I liked before).\r\n</p>\n<p>I wanted to depict 3 stages of my depression. The first one (ZEE) means isolation, and how your normal surroundings feel distant and alienating. The environment that\u2019s supposed to be comforting is suddenly chaotic and empty (but yet filled). The second is about filling the void on your own terms and in your own way, others (friend and family) can be a big influence on it (in a good or bad way).\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the third is about acceptance and calmness, but there will always be an endless void in the background. There is always a chance for depression to surface again.\u00a0 (You can find all of them on my itch page)\r\n</p>\n<p>buh bye &lt;3\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:33:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc02fe174242349c98eafda6258f7a0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Katpatat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
