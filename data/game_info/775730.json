Midway Games (the same company that published classics such as Mortal Kombat, NFL Blitz, Rampage, and more) released said FPS, Area 51, to the public on both PC and consoles. The game is considered a loose remake of the 1995, arcade, rail shooter of the same name. Area 51 offers both a creative, story-driven campaign along with intense, action-packed multiplayer. <br/></p>\n<p>In campaign mode, the player controls protagonist Ethan Cole (voiced by David Duchovny of X-Files), joined with HAZMAT Team Bravo as they are sent in to seek out HAZMAT Team Delta after the team was attacked by an alien mutant. Early into the game, Ethan becomes \"separated\" from the rest of HAZMAT Team Bravo and the player is forced to navigate and survive on their own as they uncover the secrets of Area 51... the real Area 51 hidden 3 miles below the surface of the Earth. Along the way, Ethan encounters mutants, alien lifeforms (one of which is voiced by Marilyn Manson), and alien weapons, as well as classified intel regarding conspiracy theories, the origin of the mutants, and a pact between secret societies that puts all life on Earth in danger.</p>\n<p>In multiplayer mode, players can host/join games using OpenSpy servers (emulated GameSpy servers) and choose from 19 maps to engage in game modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, infection, capture the flag, and hold (territories) with up to 16 players.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: This account is not affiliated with Midway Games or Warner Bros.
