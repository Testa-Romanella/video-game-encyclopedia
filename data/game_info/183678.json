More huts means more putties, but be careful too many putties currently drop the frame rate.</p>\n<p>Oil rigs - You can send a putty to this building and they will collect oil.</p>\n<p>Furnaces- Putties need to burn trees and oil to turn it into energy. Build more of these so putties don\u2019t have to walk as far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/829/8294414e2477c0df2b19ac88da694c55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimmothySanchez"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
