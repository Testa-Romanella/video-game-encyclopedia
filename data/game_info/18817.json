Luckily, thousands of years of human colonization have left countless derelict space craft, abandoned space stations and the crumbling remains of human settlements ripe for looting. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the galaxy is not quite dead yet. Genetically modified organisms, hardened for hostile environments, ancient mechanoids with corrupt A.I, rival scavengers, and countless hordes of humans who succumbed to a genocidal nanite plague, infest the dark corners of mankind's broken legacy.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/>Derelict will not hold your hand. Nor will it take you to A&amp;E and call your mum when you've raided a derelict full of millennia old, raging androids, armed only with a knife. (Okay it will a bit, but only because my testers made me put a tutorial in).<br/><br/>-  A wide range of hand crafted and randomly generated open worlds to explore.<br/>-  Dozens of weapons, ships and equipment pieces to loot. <br/>-  Multiple difficulties. From rogue light to rogueaaaAAAGH.<br/>-  Hordes of enemies to gib.<br/>-  NPC's to aid or end. <br/>-  <strong>Grim Epitaphs.</strong> Seek out shrines lamenting your death for phat lewts.<br/>-  State of the art 2D graphics with a customisable player character.<br/>-  Original 15 track soundtrack by Aramid and Dephin.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Totally non-biased quotes from people who've played during development:</strong><br/><br/>\"It's allright.\" - Developers nephew.<br/>\"Pretty sure I had fun.\" - Part time QA Tester Arpz.<br/>\"Looks like mario.\" - Developers mum.<br/>420/10 wpuld epitaph again. - Dr Tester, PhD<br/><br/><strong>Message from the Dev...</strong><br/><br/>The game has been a labor of love over the past 2.5 years since I drunkenly decided to try and make a game, it's been coded and designed in my spare time, and tested by my hardcore group of friends. The aim was to make a top down shooter where you weren't constrained to loading up arena's and just fighting waves, one where you actually felt a part of the world.
