It actually made him wet his pants and jump off the bed to run out of the house even after he was awake.<br/><br/>Please bear the ads, because they buy us coffee.<br/><br/>The Dream:<br/>----------------<br/><br/>There lived a horrid looking, old, cruel woman close to Palan's house. She was believed to be a witch and a merciless creature.  Palan himself has witnessed her squashing a baby squirrel, which fallen out of her mango tree.<br/><br/>Like everyone, One day she died. But,only after 3 days, people found out about it. When the ambulance took the corpse, Palan saw an emaciated black leg protruding out of the body bag.<br/><br/>Few days later, Palan went to the old lady's house to look for mangoes. This is the first time he is visiting it. When he was looking around and heard a noise from the old lady's room. To his surprise, the abandoned house was not locked, therefore he then went to the room where the noise came from.<br/><br/>Inside the room, What he saw freaked him out. Inexplicably, Her body bag was back there in her old wooden bed. Still he could see that creepy leg sticking out. Frightened, Palan turns towards his house and cries for help.  As he turned back to check on the leg again, to his horror, what he saw was the most unbelievable. The leg was crawling down towards him like a snake.<br/><br/>Screaming and sweating, Palan jumps up on a table close by. But, that creepy leg followed him like a snake in the floor. But, It did not attempt to climb up. Palan jumps on close by stuff and tries to escape. Unfortunately, A box he jumped on collapsed and he fell down on the floor. Lying on the floor, he saw that Scary Leg dashing  faster towards him like a snake towards its pray. About few meters from him, with a hissy noise the creepy leg raised its foot(head?) a bit and opened its eyes. It was the most scariest thing Palan has ever seen.<br/><br/>But, just a second before the leg touches him, Palan woke up waking up the whole village. And, now you have a game to feel his experience after 15 years.
