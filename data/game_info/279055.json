Each player is given 3 re-rolls per game that they may use to replace newly-revealed letters with a different letter, for a chance at more matches on screen. The game features 3 game modes:<br/><br/><ul><li><br/>* Score Attack - All instances of a revealed letter are awarded to the player. Player reveals all letters, then play switches to the next player.<br/>* Strategy Mode - Players can only select 3 of the instances of revealed letters on screen. When all letters have been revealed, play switches to the next player.<br/>* Versus Mode - Players can only select 3 of the instances of revealed letters on screen. Both players are working off the same screen and can absorb opponent pieces via having a scored tile to the opposing sides (of left and right, or above and bellow) of a piece or pieces to absorb them. Players take turns, as play changes to the next player after \"End Turn\" is selected.</li></ul><br/>Goal of the game is to get the best score. Scoring of complete words will earn the player bonus points.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:49:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d1/0d1fe38b6959e624610ca005764f956d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jason Free"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Steam"], "esrb_rating": null}
