The patched and unpatched version.</p>\n<p>Patch simply fixes a problem that prevented the player from going past wave 2 and added a health bar. The other version is the one that was submitted to the ITC GameJam with the problems :|\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The red button is suppose to be the nuke button. If you scroll up you will notice there is a plane with a nuke in the sky. That was suppose to drop the nuke, but sadly I ran out of time to implement that so the red button is a one time use that skips to the next wave.</p><p><strong>Timelapse:</strong></p>\n<p>Made for the ICT Winter Game Jam of 2018:\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/2018-february-ict-game-jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35f/35ffaedeea30a5aa396c5e43d6c54c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RamilHinshaw"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
