Space will call up the Minimap - unless you are on a sand tile, in which case you'll try and dig. Sail or Swim into ships or ominous looking water to start the Sea Fighting portion. Walk into Towns to call up a quick Town menu. Walk into Pirates to start the Sword Fighting. You can sail off the map in either direction, and it'll generate a new area. Sail the Infini-seas!</p>\n<p>Sea Fighting: Left/Right to turn the ship anti-clockwise/clockwise. Pressing Up/Down increases/decreases speed. Space fires a cannon ball at your nearest enemy. If you turn tail and go the opposite direction, you can flee. If you get to a ship, you can fight the Captain ( and potentially steal their ship as well. ) You can also blast them out the water by shooting them to bits.</p>\n<p>Sword Fighting: Up - high attack. Down - low attack. Left - block. Right - powerup ( which makes your timer cool down much faster. ) If your timer cools down and you haven't selected an action, you'll just stand there open to attack; but may be useful to get out of sync with the enemy!</p>\n<p>Treasure Hunting: Arrow Keys to move around. Space to dig. The numbers represent how many spaces you are away from *something*. Hit a rock and lose a shovel - you can buy these in a Town Shop. For each\u00a0Map, you'll get a higher chance on getting a chest. If there are no more things in the ground, you'll automatically leave, and you can leave at any point by walking off the side of the play area.</p>\n<p>Town: Each town gives you two options - a little shop to buy or sell Shovels and Maps, and a Tavern to replenish your crew, which leads into Grog Drinking.</p>\n<p>Grog Drinking: Space will always drink. By default, Up will leave the table, Left to hold your mug out to the left, Right to hold your mug to the right, Down will slam the mug and spill your drink. For each full mug you drink, you impress a new recruit. Spill too much and the barkeep gets you. However, each full mug makes you hiccup which can shuffle the controls around.</p>\n<p>There is no sound.<br/></p>\n<p>I'll try and get better images up soon - but that lovely \"I did this on a laptop\u00a0track pad, 5 minutes before submitting\" title screen will likely have to stay due to the rules!</p>\n\n<p>Changelog:</p>\n<p>18th August 2018</p>\n<p>Minor bug fix to allow playing full screen for fist-sized pixels on those 4k monitors, rather than the 512x512 postage stamp. Also fixed missing \"Made With GMS2\" splash.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf5/cf5da1cff9ab877427cf35cba799f915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arcade Badgers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
