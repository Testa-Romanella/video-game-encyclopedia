Take turns placing numbered cards down on a 5 x 5 grid to score lines both vertically and horizontally. The scores for each line are determined by the sum of the cards. Here&amp;#39;s an example: <br/><br/>(1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 0) would score 12 points.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, right? Well, here&amp;#39;s a couple of twists:<br/><br/>First, pairs of cards anywhere in the line count 10x their face value. Here&amp;#39;s an example:<br/><br/>(1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 0) would score 25 points.<br/><br/>Second, triple cards anywhere in the line count 100 points regardless of face value. Here&amp;#39;s an example:<br/><br/>(0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0) would score 103 points.<br/><br/>That&amp;#39;s all there is to it but remember that your final score is only your lowest scoring line, and you want the highest score possible!<br/><br/>So build evenly and don&amp;#39;t neglect weak lines...<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>FEATURES<br/><br/>* Solo play: compete against players from around the world as you strive to be the best on the online High Score table!<br/><br/>* Versus play: challenge a friend (Pass&amp;#39;n Play) or the AI to go head to head. This time, one player takes the columns, and the other takes the rows. The player with the lowest scoring line loses!<br/><br/>* Not feeling our music? Play your own and still enjoy the game&amp;#39;s sound effects.<br/><br/>------------------------------------<br/><br/>Please be sure you&amp;#39;re running firmware version 2.2 or higher on your iPhone or iPod Touch.
