I am recruiting for a game designer, I want to start with just a few \"minigames\" like, right now I'm concentraiting on getting the \"hunt the heretic\" on the planet's surface to work.. starting with one heretic, who eventually infects the whole planet if left unchecked.. and I gotta do a lot of reseach to see what kind of tools the Player would have in setting (WArhammer 40,000).</p>\n<p>new version today.. I'm really happy with this test build..\u00a0 please excuse the floating cities or any gigantic statuary</p>\n<p>below is a video from last year, test of concept, everything works the way it should, but, it was janky... new version works better, but \"warpsapce\" still doesn't look as nice as in the vid.. </p>\n<p>I need a writer too</p>\n<p>I need a writer, badly</p>\n\n\n<p>Jan 6th.. working on a game design doc, finally... I'll just post what I got at the very bottom.. I could use some help with game design, writing, art and code, etc. I've made some good games in the past, Halo CE, MechWarrior 4, Spec-Ops, Train Sim, Crimson Skies, others, but i'm more of an art person than a programmer, or music person, or writer...\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>in the warp, almost completely obscured, is the Astronomicon.. which the Player will have to use for navigation sometimes.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>REALLY BASIC GAME DOC..\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Limited, like just a tiny section of what the whole game\r\ncould be. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scope.. Player is a Mid Level Member of the Ecclisiarchy,\r\ngiven a random selection of troops and equipment and ships\u2026 Characters too.\r\nPlayer exists for a time in a Simulation of the Warhammer 40K universe, using\r\nsscripted events to portray the different ages of the Imperium. Player has very\r\nvery little effect on the Galaxy as a whole, but can have a big effect\r\nlocally.. Universe generates 10 random worlds placed nearby the Player and 3 or\r\n4 \u201cstory built\u201d worlds that are the focus of the campaign story.. Like, a\r\nShrineworld, where the Player is based out of.. a Forgeworld where the Player\r\ncan get resupplied, Terra, certain worlds in the Eye of Terror. Most worlds\r\nwill be randomly placed, and the player should be able to explore new systems,\r\nanywhere in the galaxy, solve some mission tasks, and raise in prestige to\r\nmaybe being declared a saint at the end of the game </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game starts, player is given a ship and starts at their\r\nShrineworld, surrounding the Shrineworld is 10 or so randomly placed worlds..\r\nthe Player can generate a \u201cwarpgate\u201d and enter Warpspace.. In Warpsapce\r\ntraveling between worlds is gonna be weird.. right now there are almost no\r\nobstacles or dangers in the warp, I want to change that to make warptravel\r\nreally harrowing especially for a long journey. In the Warp there are currents,\r\nthese currents shift and move about the relative position to each other in the\r\nWarp.. so a \u201cwarpstorm\u201d might be generated randomly in the warp, the storm\r\nmight make travel to another world difficult or impossible\u2026 sometimes isolating\r\na world for centuries. </p>\n<p>Time.. Time right now is set to six minuetes realtime equals\r\n1 year in gametime.. Game has a scope of about 10,000 years.. Player wouldn\u2019t\r\nlive that long.\u00a0 I'm hoping to be able to make a kinda \"bookmark\" list of different start dates, and have scripted events fire off at specific times.. just a few eents, some text, describing great moments in the Imperium..\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stuff for Player to do in game.. </p>\n<p>Explore new worlds</p>\n<p>Create and order troops, ie, play a card in the hand.. </p>\n<p>Visit a forgeworld for repairs that might take decades</p>\n<p>Orbital bombardment</p>\n<p>Collecting and delivering Imperial Tithes</p>\n<p>Make interesting decisions based on scripted events</p>\n<p>Combat (space combat is 3D, ground troops move across a\r\nglobe)</p>\n<p>Equipment Cards, Mission Cards, and the Imperial Tarot.. at\r\nthe beginning of the game and at the start of each age some random cards are\r\nchosen and thrown on screen.. equipment cards are just stuff and troops.. say,\r\nplayer creates a \u201ctroop\u201d.. think of a strike force.. in this Troop, player puts\r\n5 cards.. 1 card is a mercenary unit, 1 card is a special equipment, one card\r\nis an assassin (some character in the Player\u2019s entourage), and the last 2 are armor\r\nand weapons for the character.. </p>\n<p>there should be a \u201chand\u201d of mission cards the player can\r\nplay on whatever troops they want.. IE, 2 Assault Cards, would limit how much\r\nground forces the player could control, plus a \u201cspy\u201d mission card.. so, the\r\nTroops AI would be based on their Mission Card, and the Troops abilities and\r\nstats would be based on the equipment cards.. if set up right, this system\r\nwould be nicely expandable.. so I\u2019ll start really small, like 2 variants of\r\neverything. </p>\n<p>Imperial Tarot.. to make the game interesting and explore\r\ncertain questions in the 40K universe, at the Start of the game and at the\r\nbeginning of each \u201cage of the Imperium\u201d, one to three random Tarot Cards are\r\nthrown up on the Screen\u2026 like, \u201cThe Emperor\u201d and this card would maybe give a\r\nbonus to all the Imperial worlds for the Age.. and \u201cthe Shadow in the Warp\u201d..\r\nmight decide that the Tyranids are heading straight for Earth.. or maybe,\r\nreversed, they are wandering randomly through the galaxy.. you know, just\r\nexploring some of the contradictions and mysteries of the 40K Lore. But, will\r\nalso make the game nicely repayable. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player should be able to do what they like, but has a\r\nresponsibility to visit worlds in their jurisdiction, expand the faith, collect\r\nand bring the Tithe to the shrineworld.. or something. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spaceship.. eventually the ships will all be procedurally\r\nand randomly generated.. just going to start out with the smallest capitol ship\r\nI can think of.. There should also be escorts, etc.. The ship itself really, is\r\njust a Troop, like any other.. I think I\u2019ll call the spaceship a \u201chand\u201d so the\r\nplayer could have cards in a spaceship hand, or maybe another \u201chand\u201d on a\r\nplanet based fortress.. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Player amasses points, gains special equipment, and\r\neventually dies and gets judged and scored at the end of the game. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Combat\u2026 I\u2019m thinking about this.. but each part of the ship\r\nis divided up into destructible components\u2026 so all the guns on one side of the\r\nship could be destroyed, but the otherside could be fine.. the main problem\r\nwith simulating the combat so far.. is there hasn\u2019t been all that much to see..\r\nbut I\u2019d like to explore the capabilities of one of the smallest of the Imperial\r\nships.. and orbital bombardment. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:55:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/038/0381cbc9061ec28c7e6f5db990dfc838.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DerrickMoore"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
