The music is 100% royalty free from both artists.</p>\n<p>And yes the game was made in 4 days, currently I am in a mandatory service which leaves me with no time for game development... But luckily i\u2019ve got a 7 days vacation with 3 of them not knowing about the jam, so I was left with only 4 days for the jam :D</p>\n<p>I've enjoyed every last second of those 4 days and wish I could have continued the rest of the game jam days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Hope you enjoy playing A Lost Star!</p>\n<p>If you can give any feedback, it would help me a ton to get better as a game dev :)</p>\n<p>THANKS!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec8/ec899133855334cba2103b45c8709a9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HangingSpiders"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
