With their homeland destroyed, Hikaru, his sister Aki, and a group of unlikely characters embark on a journey to end the evil general's campaign of terror.<br/><br/>As they find themselves drawn into General Nero's increasingly sinister plot, Hikaru and Aki realize they have an opportunity not simply to face their destiny, but to shape it.<br/><br/>Ashes of Lemuria harks back to classic RPGs of the 1990s, with chibi character design, random battles, a strategic turn-based combat system, and a fully 3D explorable world.<br/><br/>THIS IS A DEMO SHOWCASED AT A EXPO BACK IN 2017. It is advised to use a Game Controller (Xbox or other).</p>\n<p>BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR FEEDBACK BEFORE RESUMING DEVELOPMENT.</p>\n<p>SOLO DEVELOPER.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:14:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f064753e5d856b1b0a3b822aaa337e41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr.Croft91"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
