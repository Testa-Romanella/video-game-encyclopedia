Light is shrouded in darkness, certain objects seem to defy gravity, and there is a suspicious red button in the room, and most importantly, the only door appears to be locked.</em></p>\n<p><em>Find a way out.\"</em></p>\n<p>This game was created by my friend and I during a 24 hour event. We were locked in a building, and tried to create what we could based around the theme of \"Peculiar Space\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>\n<p>Future plans: My current plan as of finishing the jam is to avoid working on it. It's got a nice core concept, and maybe with some polishing, it can turn into something incredible. As of now, I don't believe I'll work on it too much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks -Ryan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-15T03:38:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2dbb4cb8cdbb0155eeda3a4a62f10e7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ZaffreSheep"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
