{"id": 183942, "slug": "vishnu", "name": "Vishnu", "name_original": "Vishnu", "description": "<p>(Ok, the jam is over, so now let's be honest. This is a bad game, and I'm not gonna make it better. Don't play it.)</p><p>-----<br/>Shiva is trying to destroy the bad stuff to transform it into good stuff, but he's a bit out of whack today. Vishnu has to protect the good stuff while allowing Shiva to destroy the bad stuff.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Use the left and right arrows, or A and D (or Q and D, or A and O, or I and A, or whatever works in your keyboard, because SCANCODES!) to move Vishnu around. Press Ctrl to create a shield that will block Shiva's arrows.</p>\n<p>Vishnu is a pair of blue dots in the bottom of the screen, and Shiva is a blue dot in the top that shoots pink arrows.</p>\n<p>In front of Vishnu, there is a row of green dots representing good things. But they automatically transform into bad brown things after a while. You have to allow Shiva to shoot the bad brown things to turn them into good green things again. But if Shiva accidentally shoots a good green thing, it is destroyed forever! Good green things will make your score go up, while bad brown things will make it go down.<br/></p>\n<p>Vishnu can place golden shields in front of green and brown dots. A single shield occupies two dots. You can't place a shield on top of another shield, and you need at least 2 power to place one (your power meter is shown by smaller yellow dots on top of the screen). A shield will wear out with time. The more power you have when you create a shield, the longer it'll last. With time, you will regain spent power too.<br/></p>\n<p>Despite your efforts, all things get destroyed eventually, and that's when the game ends. Try to keep things as green as possible for as long as possible for a high score!<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I apologize if someone feels insulted by my shallow knowledge of hinduism and/or deliberate distortions and/or crappy game.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first jam game! And my first published game! But I'm not too happy about the results. I feel this idea could be a good game, but I'm not sure it can be found in that lovecraftian code.</p>\n<p>I had been wondering whether it's possible to make a great game for the Meggy Jr. RGB, so I tried something in that vein. I guess I'll keep on wondering. And I'm not sure if Meggy Jr. can really make those colors...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/add/add8e8dc93c25bd7f465717f86f9696c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DanielBzD"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
