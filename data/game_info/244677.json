Come on in and say hi!\u00a0<br/>https://discord.gg/urAwQGQ\u00a0<br/><br/><em>\"What is your motive in creating a reality bent around one's desires? Your motivation? It very well could save our lives one day, but I see no reason to attempt this feat now.\"</em>\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Deprimerie\u00a0</strong><br/>Deprimerie is a short, linear RPG with lots of branching paths and optional content. The game aims to be around 4 hours long for the main story, and 5.5 hours if you do all the stuff needed for the True Ending. It follows the adventures of Tyson, who's put into a weird world after having a strange encounter with a kitchen sink and a house fire. He soon learns he must travel this strange land and save this world, or fall to the power of Nightmare and erode away.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Things to do in this world\u00a0</strong><br/>- Fight against the forces of darkness!\u00a0<br/>- Recruit a wide variety of party members!\u00a0<br/>- Buy powerful skills and inherit them to party members!\u00a0<br/>- BECOME THE ENEMY FOR A SHORT WHILE\u00a0<br/>- Date your neighbor\u00a0<br/>- Hopefully not a lot of grinding\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Release notes\u00a0</strong><br/>A few years ago, I decided to make a unique type of RPG. I wanted to tell the story of a kid lost in his own dreams. Unaware of the already existing community for similar games like Yume Nikki, I, along with my friend ShinyKitten07, decided to make a platformer RPG hybrid. And while that hybrid idea has been lost in it's development cycle and while it has shifted from multiple engines (GameMaker, RPG Maker 2003, and now RPG Maker 2000), the game still maintained it's core focus: exploring your mind and the crazy thoughts of yours.\u00a0<br/>And now, after two years, the game is finally done.\u00a0<br/>This is Deprimerie.</p>\n\n<p>A paid add-on, titled Deprimerie: STORM of the FUTURE, is in development and plans to add over 3 hours of new content, including a large-scale update to\u00a0<em>Out There Somewhere,\u00a0</em>Deprimerie's prequel!</p>\n<p>STORM of the FUTURE will contain two new optional dungeons, as well as a 1-2 hour sidestory telling the story of STORM and how what happened after the ending of\u00a0<em>Out There Somewhere.\u00a0</em>It will also contain new scenes of dialogue and a brand-new epilogue mode, as well as improvements to the New Game+ mode!</p>\n<p>STORM of the\u00a0FUTURE is being developed by all the original developers and now with enemy redesigns by\u00a0<em>Skylight </em>and redone graphics by\u00a0<em>Shiny Kitten.</em>\u00a0It will be around $5 when it releases, and we're aiming for an early 2019 release!<br/></p>\n<p>And, of course, you'll always be able to play the core Deprimerie story for free.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89f/89f09a2ea8ab9965869474e4cb0901ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["starspire"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
