Shoot blocks and clear rows to move through space in your fancy spaceship. Our team consists of four guys. We know each other from university and study computer science. We programmed this game in our spare time, because we were interested in game development and wanted to gain experience in working in a team and coding.</p>\n<p>Have look at the code or download future releases on our Github Page.
