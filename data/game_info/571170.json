Players move a cube with detachable \"plates\" on a sticky grid. If the players cube touches the grid with no plates between them, the player falls through and loses. Players can attach black plates onto empty faces of their cube by stepping onto that grid space. Players win by reaching the yellow plate in the level.</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move. In later levels, players can be in contact with more than one grid surface/tile. Use Spacebar to toggle which grid surface you are moving on.<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my game!</p><p> My links: <br/>https://linktr.ee/enriquecmarcelo <br/>https://enriquecmarcelo.github.io/</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T08:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1bef2d20a129d2b17de7fe474c1480c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iShorty"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
