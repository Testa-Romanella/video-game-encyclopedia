It is a point-and-click adventure with several possible outcomes that depend entirely on your choices. You play as the Nameless protagonist in his search to find his dear friend who is lost somewhere on an \"abandoned\" spaceship.</p>\n<p>It's highly advisable to save as often as you can as death is a possible outcome for your character and nobody wants to rage quit.</p>\n<p>Since this was made by a one-man team if there are any bugs or issues please let me know and I'll try and fix them as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>***EDIT 10/07/17: \u00a0Fixed spelling errors***</p>\n<p>*** EDIT 12/07/17: Fixed (hopefully) looping bug in final battle**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/579/579671ad7a7dbb2421f89d638e1201ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OliveBug"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
