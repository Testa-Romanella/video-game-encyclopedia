The funeral home is secluded, surrounded only by a dark forest and a lonely road. The door closes and she is left alone with her aunt ... or maybe not with her aunt anymore, but with a demonic creature. The demon chases the girl \u2026 or is it just trying to protect her from someone? Is this a nightmare, or is it reality?<br/>The game has a creepy atmosphere and tension. The action develops quite quickly and engages players from the beginning. Players solve mild puzzles and search for various items. They explore different environments: a funeral home, a morgue, and a demonic world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We've probably all attended a funeral. Each of us has felt that uncomfortable atmosphere of sadness \u2026 maybe fear. We think about the departed person and what will happen to him or her. Now, horror lovers, imagine being alone at night with the deceased. Just thinking about such circumstances should be uncomfortable ... but what if they were to resurrect? Do you feel shivers? This game will evoke such emotions instantly, but is there any light in this gloom? You'll find out when you try the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T04:02:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa4c8065505e23afb87f5bbf8eff37f.jpg", "website": "https://www.funeralgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sysreb Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sysreb Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
