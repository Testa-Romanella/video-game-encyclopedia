There would be options to focus on your own development, attacking rivals, or trading with rivals. The goal was to make the optimal strategy one where you actually help your rivals to thrive as well, so that you would have stronger trading partners and waste less resources on fighting.</p>\n\n<p>I was able to put around 19 hours into the project over the week-long jam, much of it on learning how to create the basics of a city-builder style game. I learned a lot about using Scriptable Object s and working with 2D\u00a0Arrays, and feel I\u00a0have a decent handle now to work on the meat of this game now that the game jam is finish :P<br/></p>\n\n<p>I was a bit unlucky with my non-game workload during the game jam, but also am unfamiliar enough that I had to use a lot of my time either following tutorials, or attempting things which I couldn't get to work and then scrapping them. For example, I\u00a0initially spent a few hours trying to get a 2D\u00a0Isometric Tilemap working to use for the game, but even following tutorials could not get it to work properly and had to scrap it.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping to continue fleshing this idea out for a while and see how much more I\u00a0can learn.</p>\n\n<p>\"Energizing\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\n  </p>\n<p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\r\n  </p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>UI Audio\r\n  </p>\n<p>Kenney\r\n  </p>\n<p>License (Creative Commons Zero, CC0)\r\n  </p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\r\n</p>\n\n<p>All other art &amp; programming by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:20:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caa/caa7909d81f3dfdc7d9e94a785f7e5f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xen0nex"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
