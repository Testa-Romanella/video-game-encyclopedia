These tokens are created using a hard to cast spell, that you can find in your spellbook (TAB). In the prototype version, you have 13 spells at your disposal, to create tokens, or manipulate your opponent's board.</p><p>You have a mana pool available to you, represented by the 2x2 white square. This pool allows you to rotate the mana on the board, and is how you select the mana to cast your spell.<br/></p><p>Controls:</p><p>W A S D - Move your mana pool</p><p>Q - Rotate the mana in your pool counter-clockwise</p><p>E - Rotate the mana in your pool clockwise</p><p>TAB - View your spellbook</p><p>R - View your opponent's board</p><p>F - Cast a spell using the mana in your pool</p><p>G - Pass your turn without casting a spell<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T02:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb421306f4f9d39dfb0d0bbaa126287.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Syldarion"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
