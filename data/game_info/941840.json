Hackenbush is a simple and fun puzzle game that led to the discovery of a very large, fascinating algebraic structure, the surreal numbers. It was invented by John Conway. </p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to promote combinatorial game theory by giving fans of Hackenbush an easy way to demonstrate it, and potentially to teach it to new players as well.</p>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>The project is in early development and current features are quite limited.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Singleplayer against Computer </li><li>Local 2-Player Mode</li><li>Calculation of the surreal number associated with a position</li><li>16 Levels</li></ul>\n<p>This page lists some future feature ideas.</p>\n\r\n\r\nHeritage\r\n<p><strong>Hackenbush: Pocket Edition</strong> is made in Godot Engine and steals the difficult part of its logic from a great Hackenbush implementation for Mac and PC, by Tom R.
