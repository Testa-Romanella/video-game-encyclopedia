Uprising features additional campaigns for three factions: the Allies, the Soviets, and the Empire of the Rising Sun. The plot continues the events of Red Alert 3, making Allied victory in previous game canon.<br />\nThe Soviet Union fights for its very existence because Allied corporation FutureTech is developing a weapon that can freeze time. Its leaders want to erase Soviet Russia from the history once and forever. The war in Allied-occupied Japan continues, as there are still pockets of resistance that Allies have to suppress, and there are two Russian generals taking over parts of the Empire. There&#39;s also a standalone campaign that reveals the origins of Yuriko Omega, a Japanese girl with psionic abilities, and follows her as she becomes a commando for the Empire, and later a prisoner of the Allies.</p>\n<p>Unlike some of the previous games in the series, Red Alert 3 \u2013 Uprising allows no multiplayer modes, neither cooperative nor competitive.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2009-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:50:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4a1/4a1e460708b6c2114e4735e04dc58510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 147, "owned": 2481, "beaten": 175, "toplay": 19, "dropped": 88, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 233, "suggestions_count": 718, "game_series_count": 16, "reviews_count": 233, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts Los Angeles"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
