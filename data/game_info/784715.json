They search for eternal slumber. Help the dead find a final resting place before the moon sets by picking them up and dropping them on a grave. If they like the shape of the headstone they fall asleep. The wrong shape makes them angry. When made angry they wake any near by sleeping dead. Once all dead are sleeping, they all return to the grave.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Drag and Drop</p>\n<p>Escape - Pause<br/></p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Coding, Art and Music by HBDirk</p><p>Tools used: Unity, Visual Studio, Aseprite, LMMS, bfxr<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T13:08:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e4fdddb36b835aa2cca1035ec9a08a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HalfBlind Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
