The dust of ground up children's teeth is used as food and provides the creatures of the mythical world with their magical powers at the same time. Tootsie the Toasted Tooth Fairy and queen of Ever-no-neverwhere is supposed to divide the teeth equally among all residents of the realm. However, she has recently began smoking exorbitant amounts of weed and decided to keep all teeth for herself to extort obedience from all other residents by starving them out. She has also hired a gang of loathsome, loyal minions to guard the invaluable resource in her castle. </p><p>Desperate for magical energy Gorm the Gormless Goblin King has sent out two of his most trusted and brave warrior-mages Hokus the Holy and Pokus the Poetic to gather provisions of teeth for winter. While making their way through the evil fairy's realm they are captured and thrown into the castle dungeon. They will have to break out and try to collect as many teeth as possible in the process, so the goblins can survive the cold months.
