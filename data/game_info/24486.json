The plankton spin as they move, changing \n      directions as soon as they come in contact with an arrow that\u2019s pointing \n      in another direction. The pitch of the sound they make changes depending \n      on where the arrows are positioned. There are four types of \n      Luminarrow\u2014red, yellow, green, and blue. Each type floats at a different \n      speed and makes a distinctive musical tone. The four types of Luminarrow \n      drift together to create beautiful melodies. Completely alter the \n      direction of the arrows to change their sound dramatically.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21f/21f6381cf34d5b727070a166243700d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
