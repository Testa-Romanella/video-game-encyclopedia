Strategize with up to 10 individual beardlings in this combination of classic RPGs, roguelikes and auto-battlers. Decimate orcs, fight trolls and battle dragons - There will be Glory, Death and humongous amounts of Loot!<br/><br/><br/>As a novice commander of the dwarf legion, your journey begins with two dwarves. They start out with rudimentary gear and weak combat abilities. Only by defeating enemies, gaining experience and gold, fully equipping them, honing their battle skills, and recruiting more warriors to your ranks can you triumph.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every dwarf warrior can be customized to your liking. Equip them with different gear, and they'll take on vastly different roles. Some will become sturdy tanks able to withstand heavy damage, some will become agile assassins or archers, and some will become high damage output, yet fragile mages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By adjusting your dwarves' gear and formation, you can alter your legion's lineup and combat style on the fly. Design your ideal battle strategies and build a Dwarf Legion that is truly your own.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After each battle, players can choose one of three branches to follow. You can choose to slay monsters to level up, buy equipment, or hire new warriors. Each choice carries its own opportunities and risks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, as you play more, you'll acquire gems that unlock various skills in your skill book, providing bonuses for all your future battles, and further enhancing your preferred combat style.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>As your Dwarf Legion becomes increasingly powerful, the number and strength of your enemies will rise correspondingly, turning the battlefield into a highly intense arena.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Facing different enemy configurations, adjust your legion's equipment and positions in a timely manner. Increase your frontline defenses if the enemy is launching a lot of assaults. If the enemy has numerous mages, focus on disrupting their backline. Only with correct tactics can you increase your chances of winning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you blindly focus on improving your stats and fight with an unsuitable formation, you may be led around by the enemy or have your backline cut off. The result might not be optimistic, so please make sure to learn from your experiences, think strategically, and utilize your tactics fully!<br/><br/><br/>Although players can already jump in and enjoy commanding their Dwarf Legions, the game is still in the Demo phase. More new gear, professions, maps, and bosses are coming to heat up the battle even more!<br/>It won't be too long.
