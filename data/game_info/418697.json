Grow berries and build a home for your people, but beware of the evils that lurk underground! This minimalist strategy game will keep you busy, turn by turn.</p>\n<p>The game is currently in the Alpha stage, so please give it a try and leave some feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong></p>\n<p>Each field on the board can be used in two ways: By <em>Tapping </em>on it or by <em>Raising </em>it up (dragging upwards). There are five types of fields in the game:</p>\n<p>Empty: <em>Tap </em>to grow berries, <em>Raise </em>to build a home for your people (costs berries). The bright dots warn of a monster on its way to the surface.<br/></p>\n<p>Berries: Once growing they take 3 turns to be ready for harvest. Then you can <em>Raise</em> them to gain 5 berries instantly or let them be and passively gain 1 berry each turn.</p>\n<p>Home: <em>Raise </em>to upgrade to a better house, increasing its staming by 1 and, unless it is the lowest home level (rider), also increase its attack range by 1. Base stamina on creation is 2, maximum stamina is 4. The yellow-outlined fields are in attack-range of your homes and will deal 1 damage to all monsters. If you lose all your homes, you lose the game.</p>\n<p>Monster: They spawn randomly on empty fields with a stamina ranging from 1 to 4. They eat nearby berry fields to replicate and attack nearby homes, reducing their stamina by 1 each turn.</p>\n<p>Chest: These are rare and will disappear immediately if you don't use them. <em>Raise </em>to trigger a beneficial event, or spawn some extra monsters!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-13T02:50:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb3d1a92bb746bf8365731c3b8a633b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jasper Meiners"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
