{"id": 428615, "slug": "sanctum-breach", "name": "Sanctum Breach", "name_original": "Sanctum Breach", "description": "Sanctum Breach is a challenging top down ARPG in the vein of games such as Diablo 2, Path of Exile and Grim Dawn. It is currently in the early stages of development, however, there is still a ton of content waiting to be discovered! The game will primarily focus on Endgame content and Character Development, build versatility and replayability.<h3>Story</h3><br/>The world is falling into disarray as the device used for millennia by the Gods, the Auxillium Porta, has been destroyed in a conflict between the Gods and their offspring, of which you are one. The gods sole purpose for the Auxillium Porta was to intervene in the ways of Man and prevent them from ultimately damning themselves and the world in which they inhabit. Now you must work to unite the shattered device. By finding its fragments scattered across the universe you hope to undo the damage your siblings wrought and carry on your Father's legacy.<h3>Character Development</h3><br/>There are a myriad of different methods that can help you to diversify and strengthen you character. Gold can be found by killing enemies encountered on your travels and spent in the Goblin's Gift, after you complete his quest. This grants you points in Resistances and Damages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When you level up you gain a point to be spent in the Divinity Tree, and Ascension Ranks. The Divinity Tree has nodes for every Stat in the game. You start in the outer ring and must work your way inwards, in doing so the nodes become more powerful and the reward greater! Ascension Ranks have a selection of stats and have no spending restrictions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Skills can also be levelled up and gain a natural increase in Damage upon doing so. They also gain a point to be spent in their individual Skill Trees. These trees enhance the Skill in a multitude of ways, with 8 minor nodes that other various stat increases, 4 major nodes that modify the skills functionality, and then 4 augment nodes that further enhance that modification. These nodes must be unlocked sequentially. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Items come in 8 different rarities, some of which have powerful and unique Skills associated with them. They can either modify current skills or add an effect to the character, such as \"cast a Fireball on hit\", or \"reduce cooldown on kill\".<br/><br/><h3>Endgame Content</h3><br/>Endgame Content is the major focus of the game and there is a plethora to choose from, so everyone can find something they love!<br/><br/>Conquests are a series of encampments with a selection of thematic enemies and a mini boss. Once they have been defeated the player will face a super boss in a 1v1 encounter. Conquests also have a random modifier applied to them, such as \"immune to Fire damage\". <br/><br/><br/><br/>Mythical Trials offer a unique challenge based on the type of Mythical creature. For example in \"Flight of the Phoenix\" the player must hunt down the Phoenix and fight his multiple phases, after which he is reborn stronger and more deadlier than before. \"Maze of the Minotaur\" sees the player tracking the Minotaur down through his maze, constantly alert for his \"Shadow Form\", which cannot be killed, and must be evaded!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Boss Encounters are a 1v1 fight with a Super Boss. Each boss has it's own thematic arena and drops a multitude of loot upon death, including specific Relic items!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arena is a series of 10 waves against a multitude of different enemies. Be careful, it's easy to become overwhelmed because each wave the enemies gain a damage and health buff!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Endless Abyss is an endless dungeon with various tilesets and mini bosses. You can also summon up to 4 mercenaries to fight alongside you as you plunge it's depths looking for untold treasures!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Chaotic Encounters allows the player to fight up to 3 random bosses at once in a mad scramble for chase items. The right combination can lead to wealth. The wrong combination, a shallow grave ...<br/><br/><h3>Other Features</h3><br/>Some of the more prominent features in the game include:<br/><br/>Playable Offline.<br/><br/>Runs on Linux.<br/><br/>Six distinct classes, each with access to individual class skills.<br/><br/>Constant progression with 8 tiers of item rarity, finding gear improvements is always easy, even in endgame!<br/><br/>Powerful items feel powerful, with unique skills tied to them.<br/><br/>Each Boss has it's own loot pool with Unique items tied to them.<br/><br/>Hardcore and Softcore options available.<br/><br/>Leaderboards with multiple categories.<br/><br/>Achievements.<br/><br/>Auction House.<br/><br/>Every Endgame Zone is a Roguelike.<br/><br/>Notifications for item drops, level ups and quests.<br/><br/>Vacuum Looting and Sell All straight from your inventory!<br/><br/>Plus loads more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:38:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/4993c1d1faa91b51d14abc8559f38eb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 312, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reroll Gaming"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Reroll Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
