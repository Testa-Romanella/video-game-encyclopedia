The game is heavily inspired by and seeking to replicate lovecraftian horror elements and themes with its musical score and writing style.</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0as much as I was able to do in the short\u00a0amount of time I was given to work on this project (less than two months).\u00a0I am hoping to polish up the writing and programming chunk by chunk over time.\u00a0\u00a0The end goal for this game is to get it working with the Loominary system in order to make the color system more visual to players as the game\u00a0progresses, but it can be played with a mouse just as easily.</p>\r\nCan It Run On...\r\n<p>The game is an html file, just unzip it and it can run in any browser, even offline. You need a mouse, a working monitor, and speakers/headphones.</p>\r\nWho are you?\r\n<p>I'm Adam Cohen and I made this game in a bit under 2 months as a solo project for UCF's Fall Game Design Workshop 2017 class. I am a writer, online personality, and designer. I basically live off of coffee.</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Adam\u00a0Cohen: Writing and Programming</li><li>Chris Saunders: Music</li><li>Special thanks to Anne Sullivan,\u00a0Angel Rodriguez, The entire Loominary Team and Twinery</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/581/581e8752f3d5dee7a07f5c782447274b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["acohen95"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
