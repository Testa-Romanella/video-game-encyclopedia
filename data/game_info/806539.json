{"id": 806539, "slug": "underglow", "name": "Underglow", "name_original": "Underglow", "description": "<p><em>Underglow</em> is an underground street racing experience, created in just under 2 weeks for a college game jam, along with\u00a0Ceriumin. It's our first foray into 3D games, especially of this nature, and it's certainly a prototype, but it\u00a0<em>is</em> playable, with multiple cars, modifications, and races featuring AI drivers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong>Control</strong><strong>s</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0- Cars can be controlled with both WASD and arrow keys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Handbrake is bound to Space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- In case your car is completely stuck, you can use PageUp to try and fix it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Camera mode can be swapped with C.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Soundtrack can be skipped with L.</p>\n<p>Any other controls will be displayed in-game. Have fun :)</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations and unfinished areas</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is\u00a0a mechanical prototype, and as such <strong>doesn't contain </strong>many of the<strong> quality-of-life features and general niceties that the finished game would</strong>. For example, there's currently no pause menu or any way to quit out of races without finishing them. There's also no way to turn down the audio volume, or adjust the graphical quality. We're well aware of what could be improved, but time was of the essence and we spent the large majority of our time on vehicle handling and physics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Regardless, we hope you enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T23:27:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab5c90c4b6c70e9f6afafc3073c0b10d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Jowsey"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
