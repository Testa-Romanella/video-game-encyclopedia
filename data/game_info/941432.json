Unfortunately, the collider feature isn't working properly at the moment. However, the game is still playable and the objective is to tilt the maze using finger gestures on a mobile device to guide the ball towards one of the randomly spawned green cubes to win.</p>\n<p>I've noticed that the tilt script is still a bit buggy, but I'm working on fixing it. Additionally, I'm planning on creating a UI main canvas screen to improve the overall game experience.\r\n</p>\n<p>Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but I'm doing my best to get everything up and running smoothly. I'll be sure to keep you posted on any updates!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T16:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d8b99f5f47e88c9e5bcf8ee68cf7065.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrMitchGazz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
