I am always trying to drive my projects in a specific way for a certain outcome so I stepped out of the driver seat to see where I ended up if I went in with a looser idea on what I wanted the final outcome to be.\u00a0</p><p>Pls note: I'm pretty sure the mac exe wont look like the windows bc a lot of it is open hlsl and mac hates fragment shaders so I have a feeling it might be pink? I have no mac to test it so :')</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4349eac889521ea2ec7db4168dbaa5af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pntherart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
