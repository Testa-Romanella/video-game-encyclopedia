Where the player has to build a tower or structure of some sort. Scale that structure and reach the top to win. <br/></p>\n<p>The way the player builds a tower is that a piece will be randomly generated and is basically a homing missile.the player has to dodge a piece carefully to place it where he wants it.</p>\n<p> If the player, were to get crushed by a piece he will lose hp and turn red. eventually if he gets crushed by more pieces he will die and the game is over.</p>\n<p>In terms of movement</p>\n<p>every play through will have movement features you can get\u00a0 dash,wall jump or both.however they are random making each play through different. On top of that the values of the jump and dash gets randomized as well.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made by a team of 3 and is our first game. since it is our first game we completely forget about sound design.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:15:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c01f5d974c75cdca953b8f54c72399.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["republicofdave"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
