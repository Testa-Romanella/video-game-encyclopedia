This is my first game and while I know I can improve on this I wanted to get something on itch and submitted just so I can say that I did.</p>\n<p>Cut paper, not rock. Cutting rock will damage your blade. Cut a bunch of paper before you break your blade.</p>\n<p>Move with A and D. Jump with W. Snip with Left Click. Perform the scared scissor art, the Big Cut, with Right Click. Esc to esc, R to restart.</p>\n<p>I used some assets from the Kenney pack<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks for looking!<br/><br/>**Changelog</p><p>Players and enemies no longer get stuck in walls</p><p>Enemies change direction more often, specifically when they hit a wall<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T05:13:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418f949125c440b44f92103f3797df4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LawfulWaffle"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
