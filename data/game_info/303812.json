{"id": 303812, "slug": "sprint-2", "name": "Sprint 2", "name_original": "Sprint 2", "description": "<p>Sprint 2 is a painting tool that creates 3D primitives where the user clicks on the screen. The program reads user input from the mouse and displays the mouse position at all times. When the user left clicks on the mouse, it creates 3D primitives and destroys them after three seconds. The user can choose to have primitives automatically destroyed or not, change the time to be destroyed, destroy them with a right click or the clear all button. The user can utilize a user interface allowing an individual to choose from three shapes to be spawned. Additionally, one can alter the color scheme, size, opacity, and glow of those primitives. There is a clock that displays the current time and corresponding sunlight in the environment when the painting tool is initially opened. Time can be changed with each hour indicator or the AM/PM button.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-25T02:16:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/132/132afef511880f58e0c880d6b44cd85b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jansenpimentel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
