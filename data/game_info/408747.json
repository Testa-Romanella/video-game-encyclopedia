(there is gravity though\u2026)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't know how to fix alien technology?Hit the orange button to open your trusty manual.</p>\n<p>The blue button gives you a random assortment of high quality parts.<br/></p>\n<p>They drop from the ceiling. Catch them mid air if you can! (No, you don\u2019t get points for that!)</p>\n<p>To attach a part to the broken item, simply put it in the right slot and hear it click.</p>\n<p>Some parts require screwing, gluing or welding. Place the required tool over the part to lock it in place.</p>\n<p>Some items also need a fresh coat of paint, as shown in the manual.</p>\n<p>Use the paint-squirties at the end of the assembly line to add paint.</p>\n<p>It can get quite chaotic in your workshop.
