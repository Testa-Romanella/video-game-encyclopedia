As such, you will have to enter commands with your keyboard to perform actions and check various sources of information. A more detailed tutorial is provided at the beginning of the game. Keep in mind that not all required commands to progress the story are list so you will have to think critically and find the solution based on the context of the situation. You should also try out entering some random things that come to your mind, as there is a plethora of easter eggs hidden in the game.<br/>The Demo contains part of the first chapter of \"The Book of Falsehoods\" which is the story of a young man in modern day Detroit.
