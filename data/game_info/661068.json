{"id": 661068, "slug": "text-adventure-game-concept-demo", "name": "Text Adventure Game (Concept Demo)", "name_original": "Text Adventure Game (Concept Demo)", "description": "<p>This is an early prototype demo. It is meant to represent the main concept and idea behind a typical text adventure game I am currently making, that works like a dungeon crawler with role playing capabilities. The idea is to write and publish several short stories using the game's systems and overall mechanics, once all the work is complete. At this moment, there are only a handful of simple interactions a player can use/input, however, I plan to upgrade these and make them much more complex in nature.</p>\n\n<p>I love Dungeons and Dragons, and the idea behind this project was to be able to create my very own short fantasy stories and play through them. Every major interaction within the game is calculated/decided via Dice Rolls. Be it, player and enemy attacks/spells, avoiding or detecting traps, interacting and examining objects etc. in order to add the same unpredictability in the story.</p>\n<p>A player's major stats and Ability modifiers also tend to work similarly to\u00a0D&amp;D rules, with modifiers being added to specific dice rolls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is meant to be navigated via text but also contain a large amount of visual and auditory cues and flair, so the plan is to hopefully being able to\u00a0partner with similarly experienced artists in order to together create a much more interactive and immersive\u00a0world and story.</p>\n<p>Other than just navigating the game's fantasy world. The final idea for a typical adventure is to also contain several enemy encounters, NPC\u00a0interactions as well as Inventory and stat management via equipping/changing into different gear, as well as looting throughout the game world.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you have made it this far down, first of all thanks for taking the time to read about this little demo and for showing interest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Any feedback is always greatly appreciated!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T21:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c5/9c57ea5cc852c0c44dfa7231c730a1c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Calexper"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
