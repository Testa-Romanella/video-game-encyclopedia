It is made by a one-man team (Unus Lupus).</p>\n<p>The theme for this years Nordic GameJam was \"Pending\". The relevancy of the game to the theme is a feeling of impending doom that we intend to instill in the player, through a mixture of low light scenes, creepy music, and a few scary moments.<br/></p>\n<p>Main feature:<br/>Randomly generated maze: The maze randomly generated every time you start or restart the game. No playthrough will ever be the same.<br/>Flashlight: Your only lightsource in this game is your (un)trustworthy flashlight. However it may not be as dependable as you hope it will be..</p>\n<p>3rd Party Assets:</p>\n<p>AllSkyFree:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/allsky-free-10-s...<br/>Mangled Screams: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/creatures/mangled-screams-f...<br/>Footsteps - Essentials: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/foley/footsteps-essentials-...<br/>Stone textures: https://gumroad.com/juliosillet<br/>Music: Gminorscale aka.
