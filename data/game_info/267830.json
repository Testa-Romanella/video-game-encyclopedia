Though I call Beetle Mania a shoot em up, the strategy to get a high score is different than more traditional Shoot em Up games where you are rewarded for shooting down every enemy that appears on screen and clearing the stage as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>This took one day to build the code and systems that work together to create this prototype (10/09/2017). With the primary focus on working on gameplay there is still much work to be done with animations and audio that will be done at a later date when I have time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reason why I chose to recreate it is because it had left such an impression in my memory when I had worked so hard to reach the high score only to beat it again at a later time.</p>\n<p>CURRENTLY ONLY TESTED IN BROWSER<br/>For Best Results fullscreen.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Z or L-Ctrl = Shoot<br/>Arrow Keys \u00a0= Move Left &amp; Right</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a15d7efb25a98de36a5d779c9844157d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chaowei3"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
