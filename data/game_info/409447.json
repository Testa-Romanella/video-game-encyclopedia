She\u2019s kind but a little absent-minded and this tends to cause trouble for her every now and then. Overall she\u2019s content with life, but she\u2019s feeling boxed in and wishes that there was something more beyond the daily routines.<br/><br/>A mistake and a chance encounter forces her out of her comfort zone as she tries to make amends. In the end she finds herself part of a band with people she doesn\u2019t know, with a goal to play in a large festival that occurs every year in their city: the Wildfire festival.<br/>During the course of the game Hanako finds her old preconceptions challenged as she gets closer to the other members of the band and learns more about them. She also learns more about herself as she has to handle various crises that occur along the road.<br/><br/>Over time she learns how to handle problems instead of running away, to voice her own opinions, and that her thoughts are not inherently worth less than those of her peers.<h3>Stats</h3><br/>In terms of pure statistics, the game has: <br/><ul><li>45 Backgrounds <br/></li><li>31 CG's <br/></li><li>20 Drawn characters <br/></li><li>6 Original songs <br/></li><li>~77k Words</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T15:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/5395c4d88e9d1fe731c416d0985d7dae.jpg", "website": "https://www.visualsaga.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["VisualSaga", "Visual Saga"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Visual Saga"], "esrb_rating": null}
