Winner not only gains recognition and wealth, they are bestowed the chance to go to the surface if they wish.</p><p><em>Aqua Allstars has actually come a long way. The story and it's characters have come through several changes, just to fit the different settings. When I first started, I had wanted it to be a kind of Gold Rush type game. Like a cartoony cowboys vs indians, so I called it Rush Crush. The only character that didn't completely change from the revision is Jaja, a cavewoman type. She was literally just given a tail. It was funny because I just really wanted her in the game, I'm proud of her character. Thanks to an accident in Unity where my environment became an underwater track, I was too lazy to fix it so i changed my story instead. The desert track became an underwater battle arena and I worked around it, turning it into Aqua Allstars. In all honesty, I liked Rush Crush better but I can this is fine too.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ea/4eac8c907631a23e62b9ceeb81dbf6e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Enarbie"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
