In her last wish to remain eternal, she unleashed a new era in the Dreamscape: the phenomena known as 'Legacy' began to appear, a continuous reminder of her lingering presence.\"</p>\n<p>Legacy Raiders is a kinetic visual novel which follows the adventures of two travelers who wander the realm of dreams in search of the magical items known as Legacies. One is Lua, a power hungry but kindhearted shaman, with experience in all sorts of dangerous situations. The other is a common girl lacking in magic, who is followed by a mysterious companion. Working under the great sage Melissa Lostrius, they must recover Legacies from all sorts of different worlds while evading their pursuers from the ruthless Ferrosa Family. <br/></p>\n<p>This is an ongoing project that tells the first arc of a much greater story. With a single payment, you get access to every new chapter until the arc wraps up. The goal is to release a new chapter every month from here on out, and hopefully with your support, I can make it happen! Any feedback is appreciated, and I'll do my best to continue making and improving this story for everyone to enjoy!</p>\n<p>Our cycle is now. Let's make it good.~<br/></p>\n<p><em>!!
