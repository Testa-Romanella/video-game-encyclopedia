In the Western United States, they have also been used to track wounded\u00a0deer\u00a0and hunt\u00a0prairie dogs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and\u00a0badger-baiting, dachshunds were also commonly used for\u00a0rabbit\u00a0and\u00a0fox\u00a0hunting, for locating wounded\u00a0deer, and in packs were known to hunt game as large as\u00a0wild boar\u00a0and as fierce as the\u00a0wolverine.</p>\n\n\r\n&gt; Planned Updates\r\n<ol><li>Fix weird lines in the tile set</li><li>More levels</li><li>\r\nMore music\u00a0</li><li>SFX</li><li>Hazards</li><li>Jump animation</li><li>Enemies</li><li>Eating action</li><li>More reward types</li><li>Power-ups</li><li>High-score</li><li>Saved game</li></ol>\n\n\r\nCurrent Version: v1.0", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2cf9af88dca08da63b4a591a42b7efb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["wowjustmike"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
