Those loot places have special containers which will give you random items. If you are lucky you will get a C4 schematic which is used to craft C4 explosives. Keep in mind that in order to craft a C4 explosive you will need a C4 schematic which can only be found in loot containers.<br/><br/>The island is very big, try to find a safe spot where you can build your base. Have some though while designing your base about security. You can use different kind of materials while building your base. Wooden materials are the easiest to craft but they are also the weakest. Stone and metals are stronger but require a more resources. <br/><br/>Keep in mind that you claim the area you're building your base with a plotpole / totem. it is important that your plotpole is hidden and well secured. Whoever reaches your plotpole has the option to add himself as owner, then it would be easy for him to dismantle your base as he likes.<br/>Keep your important stuff in a strong locker/vault. Use a codelock to lock it up. There are different kinds of lockers with different kinds of strengths.
