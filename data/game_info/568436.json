For they bear the sole responsibility of igniting the Sun at\u00a0each dawn. The path is treacherous: filled with ghastly ghouls of darkness itself. However, with each death, an echo of light is left behind to guide the Phoenix'\u00a0way in the next life.\r\n<p>Flight of the Phoenix is a short vertical-flight platformer made for the\u00a0<strong>WOWIE!</strong> Jam 3.0.</p>\n<p>The theme of the jam was\u00a0<strong>Failure is Progress</strong> with the subtext of messing with\u00a0the concepts of winning and losing. Upon death, the Phoenix is merely reborn from its ashes,\u00a0and completing the goal of\u00a0igniting the Sun only lasts until the next dusk. Additionally, \"failure\" (death) provides some progress to the player by introducing a \"light echo\" to clear away the darkness where you died making it easier to navigate once reaching there again.</p>\n<p>I find it crazy how a full weekend of work made a game that lasts only a minute to play haha, but I had a great time working on it and participating in the community discord. I experimented a lot with the Unity Animation system and\u00a0events, and made all my own sound effects with things in my house.</p>\n<p>Any feedback is much appreciated, I'm always looking to improve!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>A/D to turn left/right (counter/clockwise)</li><li>Escape to exit to menu (in case you run into a bug)</li><li>Mouse/trackpad for menus</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Game made by HLBC (me!)</p>\n<p>Music by Joshua McLean CC 4.0 (He's got some great songs free to use\u00a0https://joshua-mclean.itch.io)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T13:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45b/45b49c4182c96271a3212b590a3bfad0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["HLBC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
