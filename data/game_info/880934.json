This is founding epiphany behind\u00a0<em>Feta: Skylines</em>, a game which reimagines the far too traditionnal mechanics of salad-makers and attempts to apply them to the sandbox-style gameplay of city-builders.</p>\n<p>And sprinkles a little bit of Erik Satie on the top just for the mood setting (I found making feta salads whilst listening to classical music immensely increased its quality, but that may just be a personnal thing).</p>\n<p><em>The background of this page is a little sneak peak into the hellish world of feta suburbs. You were warned.</em><br/><br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nGameplay videoOriginal Idea\r\n<p>This game was made as part of my first university assignment (Goldsmiths, London). The idea was to find a meme or short video and create a playable experience (using basic Unity3d geometrical shapes and textures).</p>\n<p>Well, I was making a feta salad one night and I found this amazing meme of Mark Zuckerberg presenting <em>Meta</em>, only he was holding a massive block of feta in his hands and the company logo behind him was now <em>Feta</em>. This made me laugh a lot, and I remembered that my local grocery store sold fresh feta, which they stacked on top of each other.</p>\n\n<p>And it hit me: stacks... feta... blocks... TOWERS? Thus was born <em>Feta: Skylines</em>, where towers are made of cheese, roads are slices of bread and trees are made of cucumbers. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>(Reference --&gt; https://twitter.com/IamHappyToast/status/1453814065072152583)<br/></p>\r\nDisclaimers\r\n<p>You might be thinking, this is what a good feta salad should look like:</p>\n\n<p>So... where are the olives in the game? Or the tomatoes?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, budget restrictions and upper management shenanigans forced the developper's hands here. Something about the CEO being allergic to tomatoes and having a phobia of olives? Your guess is a good as mine. If you want to yell at them, you can mail them (that person is me - yell at me).</p>\n<p>Also...<br/></p>\n<p>This is my first ever video game (I've been learning Unity for less than 6 weeks), which means a couple of things: <br/></p>\n<ol><li>You might will encounter bugs. These can include audio levels not being normalized, lighting issues, behavioural inconsistencies, potential <em>NASA</em>-hacking, occasional city-wide\u00a0power\u00a0outages\r\n</li><li>It's janky as hell. Sorry in advance, and please be patient\r\n</li><li>I  learned a lot in the process of making this. If I were to do it all  again from scratch, I would hope it woud be of much better quality\r\n</li></ol>\n<p> Still, I am quite proud of my work overall and I hope you will have a not-so-unpleasant experience playing <em>Feta: Skylines</em>.
