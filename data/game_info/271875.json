I am new to programming and games so I thought it would be a fun project that would help me to learn JavaScript.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make a game like Diablo\u00a0 and Phaser3 had an example on their examples so I put them together and made them work together.</p>\n<p>It was a really fun project and I am really loving making a game.\u00a0 I wanted to add items that drop and can be equipped, since the code is already there. I only started a week ago though and ran out of time.</p><p>If anyone wants to work on a game together please let me know! I am thinking of isometric space themed RPG.</p>\n<p>update: having problems getting the sound to work so I disabled it for now :(</p><p>If you fork the project on github you can run it easily with sound!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc8075860550f8776dc8a8c1c4a7d0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jesse989"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
