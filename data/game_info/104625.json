{"id": 104625, "slug": "town", "name": "Town", "name_original": "Town", "description": "<p><em>(Update 25 July 2017: Fixed the weird flickering train glitch.)</em><br/></p><p>Create your own little railway network and then hang out on your little trains in your little town. You can place stations, lock the camera on different trains, switch to a first-person view, look around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys to place the next tile in the current position. If you build yourself into a corner, use backspace to delete tiles and try again. The track is complete once you connect your track back to the original station.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0spent way too long on this but I learned a whole lot! Mostly in the realm of modelling. I made my own simple buildings in Blender for this project, and I'm really happy with them! I used the tool Sprytile to do that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0originally had plans for split tracks which you could cross between and hills and some other stuff but it all got way too complicated, and I kind of really like the simplicity of this one. There's still one or two small glitches buttttttt I don't really care anymore. Depending on how fast the game is running, carriages are going to be further away from their train. If you see a train flying off towards the horizon, then you win the game.</p>\n<p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #21 of 50.)</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>Track Placement Mode</em></p>\n<p>Arrow keys - place track piece on empty tile</p>\n<p>S - place station tile</p>\n<p>Backspace - delete last tile</p>\n<p><em>Town Mode</em><br/></p>\n<p>Mouse - rotate camera</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel - zoom camera</p>\n<p>Left click - Panoramic View of the Golden Gate</p>\n<p><em>General</em><br/></p>\n<p>esc - quit</p>\n<p>r - reset</p>\n<p>h - hide/show controls</p>\n\n<p>As usual, Windows build is untested.
