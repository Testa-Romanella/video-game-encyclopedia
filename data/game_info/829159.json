Test your memory by turning up to 30 cards, remembering the faces of the girls who have already gone out and looking for their corresponding partner in total. 15 couples in total! Can you beat the hard difficulty, where you only have 1:30 to find them!?</p>\n<p>By beating a game, you unlock the girls' cards, which you can see in good quality in the gallery, along with a brief description of them. Which is your favorite?</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game is based on my yuri hentai game called Love's Heart;</p>\n<p>https://capky-games.itch.io/loves-heart<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0which takes place inside an academy and where, as of version 0.2 (coming soon), the player can join a total of five clubs, one of them being video game clubs. .</p>\n<p>If the player joins that one, they can play a total of six mini-games. Some of them are made with free plugins that I found on the internet. But two of them were made by me and this is one of them. It was incredibly difficult for me to program in RPG Maker a playable version of memory. It was a week's worth of hard work where I had to solve an awful lot of bugs and there are probably still some left. If you come across a bug, please report it to me! And I'm so sorry!</p>\n<p>Since it was such a difficult challenge for me to make this minigame, but I felt so good when I finally finished it, I decided that it deserved more than just being played by those who joined the gaming club. That's why I've decided to publish it as a small separate project on this page. It's not a big deal, it won't keep you long. Still, I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d4/5d468f3275d2f98045ed05a88e347886.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Capky Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
