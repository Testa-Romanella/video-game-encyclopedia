The winner will earn the right to claim the title of Grand Champion and earn a shot to battle Conkis itself.</p>\n<p>Upon the declaration creating this perverse tournament, Conkis also said it would vaporize the entire galaxy for sport and amusement if the Grand Champion cannot defeat it. This is not about bragging rights, this is not about sport, this is not even about your life, but the life of everything in the galaxy. Can you gather the four cups of the Forpes Group, the Dorbal Cup, the Pitchkal Cup, the Nasal Cup, and the coveted Forpes Cup itself to earn the title of Grand Champion and save the galaxy?</p>\n<p>\"Jan Ken Crush\" is envisioned as a combination of retro character-driven fighting games (making the characters in this game doubly ridiculous though)\u00a0and classic JRPG's with\u00a0a JRPG style battle system refracted through the classic hand game Rock Paper Scissors/Jan Ken\u00a0Pon. In addition to the hand game's original mechanics, a \"Non\" option can be combined with any of the original hand signals to block \"attacks\"\u00a0and earn power stars that can increase attack power and unlock the \"Heal\"\u00a0option that can be combined with a hand signal to substitute opponent damage with HP recovery.</p>\n<p>The game features a minimalist pixel-art graphic aesthetic with an exciting and nuanced retro synth soundtrack spiritually influenced by Nobuo Uemastu, Yasunori Mitsuda, John\u00a0Carpenter, and classic Bollywood music.</p>\n<p>Can you save the galaxy from Conkis?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T06:41:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96a/96a0354700839b02288451ff4703563e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lungfish3000"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
