Sure, you got 32,761 points in Geometry Wars, sure, but does that mean you did well? And yeah, you finally cleared that Mario Maker level, but it took you 10 tries. Is that good? Does it matter?<br/><br/>Militia brings the thrill of victory to the single-player experience. It features a single-player ladder system built around tightly designed and strategic turn-based gameplay. It's simple to pick up, and from the moment you start, you'll be learning and improving -- building your skills, learning new strategies, and ranking up. And as you do, the game evolves with you, providing a worthy challenge every time, so you can get knocked down, come back, and bask in the joy of your well-deserved win.<br/><br/>But don't take our word for it:<br/>\"[Milita] might be the best single player strategy game\" of the year (Keith Burgun, designer of 'Auro', Dinofarm Games).<br/>\"A breath of fresh air for strategy gamers\" (PlayPlayFun.com),<br/>\"It's like chess, but much better,\" -PC Preview version review<br/>\"Holy crap, this game is actually really good!\" -Android user review<br/><br/>Militia on Steam:<br/>http://store.steampowered.com/app/421260/ </p><p>Please send any bugs/feedback to braingoodgames (at) gmail </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/660/660ff5106574efb1676657b2024b063c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BrickRoadDX"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
