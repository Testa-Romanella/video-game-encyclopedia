From crafty wizards with a twinkle in their eyes to valiant knights and enchanting creatures, your squad is as charming as it is formidable. Imagine moving them across a unique hexagonal grid, where every step is a chance to outmaneuver your opponents and claim victory.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut here's the catch - it's all about smart moves and smarter resource management. You've got to think on your feet, juggling energy and movement points to pull off those game-changing moves. Whether it's unleashing a powerful attack, calling in reinforcements, or nimbly navigating the battlefield, your decisions shape the course of the clash.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd the ultimate goal? To outsmart your opponent and take down their king. With nine different pieces to spawn, each with their own cost, pattern, and skills, the possibilities are endless. You'll need to adapt your strategy, exploit weaknesses, and sometimes even turn the tide of battle when the odds are against you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T06:28:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bc/2bc9721e118bae74eb70c71247db6d9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wes W"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wes W"], "esrb_rating": null}
