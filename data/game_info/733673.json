This was made using Unreal Engine 5 with lumen enabled and big rookie mistake it only supports 1440p for the time being. I have a build ready to go that has graphics options but the current upload was my entry for the game jam. If you're at all nterested please check back in the following days when I release the updated version! I\u2019m also addressing a few more things I didn\u2019t get to finalize before the deadline. It\u2019s my very first game which I\u2019m sure is apparent! Thanks for stopping by and I really appreciate all feedback on ways to improve the game and making sure my future games don\u2019t have the same mistakes!\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>WASD for movement</p>\n<p>Point &amp; Click with mouse for shooting.</p>\n<p>The Game needs a decent amount of polish but I worked very hard to get this in a \"finished\" state for the Game Jam. There's no way I was going to miss this one. It's currently 3 in the morning and I finally got the game packaged and submitted. Expect some updates and better options in the next week or so. Thanks for playing and all feedback is welcomed!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:30:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7bf0f687a74bea6eeed8a76d89e3d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IrregularVision"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
