However, it's the last day of the school year, and she has yet to tell him how she feels!\u00a0\u00a0If she wants to be with him, she must tell him today or lose her chance forever. She's spent all night writing the perfect love letter for him, but will she be able to get her feelings across and get the boy? Or will things have to take a darker turn for her to get what she wants? Or will recent events possibly get in the way of her plans?</p>\n<p>There is currently only\u00a0 1 Bad Ending at the beginning of the game, which can be accessed by not putting the letter on the desk and choosing to give up. Choosing to put the letter on the desk leads to the start of the main plot, which currently has one of 3 paths available. I'm very new to RPG Maker, so please bear with me! Any suggestions and feedback are greatly appreciated! A lot of the images and the menu screen are placeholders, so keep this in mind! Things are going to change over time, including some scenes.</p>\n<p>All characters are 18+, and any events or characters depicted are completely fictional. Game contains death, violence, and crazy behavior.\u00a0Don't commit violence!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T18:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b040caa036677f419561b332ec6204e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IcarusSunshine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
