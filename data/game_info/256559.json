If you're not sure hit the \"get a clue\" button ( get it because it's a hint and also \"Get a clue\" was slang people said in the 90s ) Getting a clue will mean you get less points, but getting it wrong is 0 points so it's worth it.</p>\n<p><strong>Things we wanted to get in and didn't have time for/known issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>There seems to be a bug where some systems can't play and get a \"Couldn\\'t find any pixel format that matches the criterias.\" error. Working on a video to just show stuff off. If you know anything about Rust or Piston and what might cause this error please let me know in the comments!</li><li>Found a bunch of cute throwback images for answers</li><li>Any form of animations and better feedback</li><li>Making people lose early</li><li>Better question variation</li><li>A reset button, for now just close the window ( theres no more content on game over, you're done )</li><li>This is one of my only gamejam games not featuring my cats, in all fairness they hadn't been born in the 90s but still, I can't shake the feeling that this game would have been better if we had worked in a pre-cat internet takeover somehow</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year Ready At Dawn made a big point of switching from C++ to Rust. Wanting to see what could challenge the mighty C++ ( and not just be an individual's pet language ) I wanted to try it. It seems like Piston is the most popular engine now so I was just messing with it.</p>\n<p>My main takeaway was that a weekend project isn't long enough to really take advantage of the concurrency safety rust provides, so instead you just get reminded of the mild inconvenience of really needing to think through what is mutable and what is const. The idea of a const default is really interesting but takes a lot of getting used to.\u00a0 in terms of ecosystem, Library dependency management is great, but IDE support I found was meh.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/4020b921d5905e645c5666885d8b82d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UltraRat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
