This version includes some polish that was not able to be applied before the end of the jam.</p>\n\n<p>In Smithy of the Fishy you will traverse randomly generated dungeons, obtaining as much treasure as you can while avoiding the numerous hazards around you. Be careful, because all the while you are racing against the clock\u00a0\u2014 if you are still in the dungeon by the time the sun reaches the end of its path, you will be whisked away from\u00a0the dungeon with only half your treasure! Make sure to find your way back to the door in time!</p>\n\n<p>For news on updates and development for future versions of this game, you can follow our Twitters linked above! With enough support and positive reception, we hope to expand this game much further into bigger, better, and fishier things. :)</p>\n<p><em>Please do not use this build in your consideration for voting on the GM48 website, as it contains content and fixes that were not present in the submitted version (which can be found here).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/7487319e81d69617e799d56b9ed7bb5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benstar", "failpositive", "lazyeye"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
