However, you must only use your abilities when necessary.<br/><br/>The game comes with plenty challenging levels that will push your gaming skills to their maximum, in a world full of obstacles such as parked \"speed demons\", soulless guys carrying glass panes and many other, only to catch the much-loved kebab.<br/><br/>It all started in a sunny day when a young guy ordered a kebab and bit into it like a starving barbarian; then, the kebab jumped from his hands and started running desperately. He couldn't believe his eyes, but shortly after realizing that his wallet was empty, he started running with all his power to catch the tasty kebab.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/237537826135f582e187c692647f6e4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 191, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cristian Prunaru", "Razvan Humulescu"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bidoniera Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
