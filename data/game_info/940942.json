Make enough money that you can retire.<br/></p>\n<p>A 7 Day 2023 RogueLike submission. Programmed using Godot, in under 7 days.\r\n </p>\n<ul><li>Every level is procedurally generated and populated.\r\n</li><li>The parameters change as you progress to make things more difficult.</li><li>Starting at one end of the level, make your way to the exit at the other end. Pick up as much valuable stuff as you can hold.</li><li>Don't take too much time, or the goblins will return home and hunt you down.</li><li>Take advantage of equipment. Knives will kill enemies instantly, but they can only be used once before breaking. (It's a lore thing.) Blockades can prevent goblins from reaching you.</li><li>Be careful not to get stuck in a cave! If you're carrying too much, you might not be able to escape.</li></ul>\n\n<p>A Note for MacOS users: This game was built on the first release of Godot 4, which has a number of breaking errors with web-based MacOS builds. Please use the downloadable build and let me know if you encounter any issues. I plan on releasing a patch as soon as these issues are resolved.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66b/66b28e33c33afd2da9675b8795c20b81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pharaoh439"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
