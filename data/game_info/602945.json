Enemies will spawn periodically around the river and try to attack both you and the base. Currently, there are only 3 modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with their own set of wave spawners and enemy counts.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The game is my first project and I learned the basics of the game through a book that I was given as a gift.</p>\n<p>I Hope you enjoy the game! Leave any feedback you'd like. However, this is no longer going to receive any updates due to me just wanting to have a fun little project to have.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T06:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18bfc60afae6be4f46fae859cdee50be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bluewither"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
