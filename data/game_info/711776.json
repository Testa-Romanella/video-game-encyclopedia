A section of the Malgam\u2019s house becomes a playground that brings cultures from around the world together through food and art.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>It's late at night in the Malgam house\u2026</p>\n<p>The children are all in bed after dinner, but the 5 year old Ana Malgam\u00a0 noticed a slice of delicious cake sitting on the counter before she went up to her room. Now she's snuck back downstairs to get her late night snack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To accomplish her goal she needs to find her way to the kitchen without her dads finding her. She needs to stay quiet so they don\u2019t hear her, and she can hide in pieces of furniture. Her siblings, who\u2019ve been adopted from different cultures, left snacks with special powers all around the house to help her along the way.</p>\n\n\n<p>Late Night Snackin\u2019 has simple mechanics: Move, hide, and use items. The player can go straight to the cake in the kitchen, strategically using timing and hiding spaces to get past their parents. Or the player can explore different rooms, picking up snacks from around the world and testing what powers they contain. Either way the Malgam house offers delicious rewards.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:48:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb0/eb0d8d025bee77a12a8c8f6fdbda9d23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Gameheads"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
