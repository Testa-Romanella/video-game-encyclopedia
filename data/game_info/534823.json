Browser version does work, but I recommend the mac download if you have a mac. If you play the browser version ***YOU WILL NOT SEE THE FINAL CINEMATIC***. Once you escape the pet shop the screen will go black. I was unable to get the video to work for the browser, but it works just fine for the download. I still wanted people to enjoy on browser, even if you can't see the final cinematic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instructions- Please read as controller is a little different at first.</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, space Bar to interact with an item if it glows red. To interact with your items, Left click on the item in the top right inventory. To give an item to a character, you first click on the item then chat with a character. If it is the right item, the animal will take the item from you.\u00a0To progress the chat when interacting with an animal click the continue button, at the end of the dialogue you will be prompted to hit space bar to end the chat (I know not the most intuitive buttons, but wanted to get the game submitted for the Secret Santa Game Jam)!</p>\n<p>Huge shoutout to Sebastian_Whyte who was the composer for the music! Check out this guys music if you get a chance! Incredible stuff\u00a0https://m.soundcloud.com/sebastian_whyte</p>\n<p>***Quick Note ***</p>\n<p>The game is definitely note perfect lol.\u00a0 There are some bugs. One thing to make sure while playing is to make sure your character is standing still before interacting with another character. There's a weird bug that if you move while talking to a character, you will be unable to close out of the dialogue screen. The other big thing of note is if you want to hear all of the characters back stories, MAKE SURE you talk to them BEFORE you give them their item, otherwise it will skip their intro dialogue. Last thing is there are a few characters (Hamster, cat, and Lizard) that you may have to talk to several times in order to get the item required from them. This was my first time creating a narrative game and definitely was not perfect with it. But basically keep trying to interact, especially with those three and \u00a0you will get the items from the to continue with the story! Hope you guys enjoy!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T05:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14b/14b77cab5fabd1e71036991132033271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["dice099"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
