Though the two may seem tense about each other at first glance, they realise the only way to return to the surface from the ruins is by working together. So, by using each other's strengths they slowly but surely complete these oddly well placed puzzles while exploring the ruins, wondering what happened to the ancient civilisation that once roamed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p><strong><em>My Friend, The Golem</em> </strong>was created by the team Holy Stone Beetroots over the length of 2021 as the Capstone project for our respective Bachelor Degrees at Swinburne University.</p>\n\n<p>The Team:</p>\n<p>Matt Smith - Programmer</p>\n<p>Bert Henkel - Programmer</p>\n<p>Daniel Schurmann - Programmer</p>\n<p>Daniel Chadderton - Programmer, Game Design</p>\n<p>Darcie Cotton - Artist</p>\n<p>Jake van Bockel - Artist</p>\n<p>Jordan Chang- Level Designer, VFX</p>\n<p>Joe Wang - Producer, Writer</p>\n\n<p>Freelancers</p>\n<p>Sara Dimech-Betancourt - Artist</p>\n<p>Chris Ovens - Composer</p>\n<p>Nick Scully - Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:06:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75e/75ee814953f7f9a1680d8c9ca28ae8c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bert Henkel", "Plutonian", "VelenGeth", "twych", "Changbot", "Unusual_25"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
