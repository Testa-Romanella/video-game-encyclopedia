A super-mobile ball which has three different ways to move:</p>\n<ul><li>Rolling</li><li>Jumping</li><li>Pulling itself towards and swinging between objects using a grappling hook.</li></ul>\n<p>Control this ball and swing yourself all over the map.</p>\n<p>This game is currently in development. Currently, you can use a parkour to get to know the controls of the vehicle. Feel free to leave your feedback. Future updates will include a couple of mini-games using the ball-mechanics.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T08:39:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f08bf160d3011506e3d47f701191709.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VanFelsen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
