You will travel across the many ruins of a once blooming kingdom in order to reach the aether where Tlaloc can finally find peace. Throughout the adventure, you will use the jumping mechanics to jump over the pits and walls you encounter in the ruins. The stages will each introduce certain obstacles as you progress as well as testing your skills along the way. The theme of adventure and the jumping mechanics of the gameplay will allow you to seek that sense of abandonment and depreciation that would be found in such ruins. You will jump over collapsed floors, deep pits, bodies of water, and broken walls.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:44:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c514d4dfa0dcfe8d0f565c340629a2f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["cjrodriguez503"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
