So you decide to start yelling and shooting back.\u00a0<strong>Control your plane with your voice! The louder you scream the higher you fly! </strong><em><strong>Before playing in the browser you have to give access to the microphone. If the controls feel too responsive, try lowering your microphone volume or stand further away from it.</strong></em></p>\n<p>All assets in the game are created by me with the exception of the font. which you can find here:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/jet-pilot.font</p>\n<p>I made the game in <strong>Godot </strong>engine (and o Lord how i love the engine). Art was made in <strong>Aseprite</strong>, I\u00a0cannot recommend this software enough. The sound was made in <strong>bfxr</strong>.</p>\n<p>I prepared a bit for this week's theme, when I saw that this theme was winning, I decided to try some prototypes in Godot. However, I did so just to learn the ways Godot handles audio input (and it is rather weird) and I didn't copy/paste any code I made previously.</p>\n<p>I managed to implement the voice controls (player needs exactly 0 buttons to play the game). I also implemented 1 enemy type that is spawning in increasing frequency, enemies are flying across the screen and shooting at you. I did implement a simple particle effect (my first particle effect in Godot I\u00a0believe) and sounds for shooting and explosions. I was left with around 1 minute of time, so I didn't manage to record any music this time.</p><p><strong>Source code can be found here:\u00a0https://github.com/althaj/Mayday-Mayday</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:17:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acf/acf68b8483a71fd0aee26690ff20865f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["althaj"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
