{"id": 763253, "slug": "phrogchamp", "name": "PhrogChamp", "name_original": "PhrogChamp", "description": "<p>Hello!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>FrogChamp is a game about climbing up a tree as a frog, the catch being ofcourse that every fall is a massive loss for progress. The game is short but challenging. The idea has been based on Jump King but with a bunch of twists. All the tools you get are: The mouse for movement - You can press left mouse button to make a small jump towards the cursor or you can hold and release for a bigger jump. The arrow keys for rotation - You can only stick to surfaces if youre facing them with your butt and arrow keys are here to help you with that!\r\n</p>\n<p>Highly recommended to try and speedrun this game and share it with everyone in the comment section!\r\n</p>\n<p>Art: Made in Aseprite by myself.
