BoB\u00a0features a GM-less style of gameplay where players (2+) create their own worlds to explore. All outcomes of events and instances will be decided through a d6 die for gameplay simplicity, and the\u00a0use of an interactive map labeling system. The game map takes place on chess boards, inviting the use of digital and physical means of play. Tiles will represent different planets, created by the players themselves that discover them.</p>\n<p>BoB is\u00a0centred around an \u201cevery man for themselves\u201d space mission where the\u00a0story emphasizes the need for our characters to be selfish and cunning, in order to benefit their own motivations. The details are up to the players, while the framework of the game objectives are laid up. Optional prompts are also provided\u00a0for new players, to help ease the stress of story improvisation.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:35:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af9a97b9a91ea5143825aa0246960eec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ocadugroup5"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
