Beginning development in early 2021, this was meant to be my magnum opus. There were going to be mosquitoes that would accost you as you made your way through the swamp and a stock market mechanic where you pulled up your phone to buy and sell stocks. Alas, my computer broke and now the project is burning in Hell, probably. I couldn't even add in rocks that you can jump over! I'm really just uploading this for archival purposes. I hope you enjoy my \"game,\" and may there be better things to come.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a35/a350c9050cf637ce552ae45d778e020d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sgetch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
