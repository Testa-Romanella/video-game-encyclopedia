Invite your friends to a QuizPoker session or compete against other players from the community by creating your own session or joining an already created game.<br/><br/><strong>How it works.</strong><br/>A question round in a QuizPoker game might look like this:<br/><br/>All players are asked a guessing question. <br/>For example: <br/>\"In what year was the musician Elton John born?\"<br/><br/>You enter your guess in the input field. Let's assume your guess is 1949. <br/>Now the first betting round follows:<br/><br/>Since you are unsure how good your guess is, you, just like your opponents, do not bet any chips. Therefore, the first hint to the answer is now given.<br/><br/>1st hint:<br/>\"His big break came in 1970 with the album Elton John.\"<br/><br/>Your guess doesn't seem so bad, so you raise.<br/>Your opponents call.<br/><br/>2nd hint:<br/>\"Elton John was born shortly after the end of World War II.\"<br/><br/>Things are looking good for you! You raise again, so one opponent folds. Now the correct answer is shown.<br/><br/>Answer:<br/>\"1947\"<br/><br/>You are only 2 years away from the correct answer. If there is no Elton John fan at the table, your chances are not bad. You raise again.<br/><br/>Now the players reveal their guesses.<br/>Player 1 has already left the game after the second clue. Player 2 guesses the year of birth to be 1952.<br/>You are closest and win all the chips of the entire question round!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T19:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2b/e2bb994c0e37b651f2e0b6638192d8f3.jpg", "website": "https://siwalugames.com/quizpoker", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Siwalu"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Siwalu"], "esrb_rating": null}
