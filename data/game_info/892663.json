There are overall 3 types of rolls in this game:<br/></p>\n<p>1. Basic - They do simple function, get close to enemy rolls and bite them to death. They have basic hp and damage</p>\n<p>2. Armored - They are much more tankier than your average rolls, being able to take many hits and still punch back. They are largely on the front of the army.</p>\n<p>3. Tank - They have normal HP and a ranged attack, usually helpful against surrounded enemies or taking care of the enemies from the distance.</p>\n\n<p>There is also another Roll type I haven't mentioned, but that's because there isn't much known about it. Little whom have seen it, and those that did barely managed to escape. Only myths are known about an unwinnable foe, towering meters above anything else. Legends say it cannot be defeated, and those that dare to challenge it will be put to death swiftly. If you see it, you are as good as dead.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Left click to select unit, dragging with left click does box select</p>\n<p>Right click to move units (they attack automatically)</p>\n<p>WASD to move camera (Or move mouse to edge of screen)</p>\n<p>E to select all units<br/></p>\n<p>R to <strong>Rebake </strong>nearby dead units</p>\n\n<p>Game is created by\u00a0DeanConnor#6418, I am simply publishing it under his request.</p><p>Changelog:<br/></p><p>Rebake 1.1\u00a0</p><p>-\u00a0Fixed minor bugs</p><p>- Fixed credits</p><p>- Added an ending</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T13:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71f649ef8025274532f392fd55a10bbb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rulet"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
