I made this in a week, so I couldn't add all I wanted to, but I still think it's pretty fun. It's like that game Getting Over It, but probably half as good and a tenth as polished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T16:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a0/3a0dcc431fef0c96a2561f2d9f6260ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LethargicTree"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
