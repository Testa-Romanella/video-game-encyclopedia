While I am in the 10th grade and still an amateur at coding, I am hoping to work on this idea some more and actually make it an enjoyable game. At the moment I am uploading it in order for me to test out and see whether this game will work on other systems apart from my own laptop. Hope to hear some constructive criticism as I am quite aware that there are bugs in the code. Thanks for reading :D.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["FrozenGarvMonkey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
