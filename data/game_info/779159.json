{"id": 779159, "slug": "necroncide-arena", "name": "NECRONCIDE ARENA", "name_original": "NECRONCIDE ARENA", "description": "<p><em>Necroncide Arena</em> is a local multiplayer game where two players take turns controlling their respective teams of 3 \u201chero\u201d mercenary characters with their own tactical abilities and stats. It uses a target selection system (similar to XCOM) but is played from the third person perspective. The objective is to eliminate the opposing team. There is also a mutant pod that spawns randomly in the map that, when destroyed, will spawn a mutant teammate, the <em>Necron</em>, for the team that frees it giving them a slight edge in firepower. If this event occurs the non-mutant controlling team can still try to win by eliminating the mutant and running to the exfil location (demarcated by green signal smoke) to win the game.</p>\n\n<p>To play remotely, we recommend Parsec which is now owned by Unity!\u00a0https://parsec.app/</p>\n\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n<p>- 3v3 PvP action with asymmetrical tactical elements to turn the tide in your favor!<br/></p>\n<p>- Turn-based target lock combat played from the third person perspective.</p>\n<p>- 3 Hero characters: The Shadow, Savage and Infiltrator each with their own unique weapons and stats.</p>\n<p>- Unique tactical abilities for each hero: penetrate solid walls with the Shadow\u2019s Vantage Strike sniper shot, stop the opfor in their steps with the Savage\u2019s Paralyzer Rounds and leap away from the enemy\u2019s fire with the Infiltrator\u2019s Exo!</p>\n<p>- Locate and destroy the drop pod to free the terrifying X-III Necron \u2013 a monster of flesh and steel who will fight for its captors!</p>\n<p>- Featuring a 3 lane map with 2 levels of verticality with fully immersive sound, VFX and animations!</p>\n<p>- Destroy patrolling drones in an explosive fashion to gain healthpacks!</p>\n\r\nTOOLS USED:\r\n<p>Game Engine \u2013 Unity\r\n  </p>\n<p>Modeling Suite \u2013 Maya, 3DS Max, Zbrush\r\n  </p>\n<p>Texturing \u2013 Substance Painter, Photoshop\r\n  </p>\n<p>Animation \u2013 Maya, Mixamo\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music/SFX \u2013 Audacity, LMMS, Reaper, FreeSound.org, Licensed (attributions mentioned in game credits)\r\n  </p>\n<p>VFX \u2013 Unity Shader Graph, Unity Particle Pack\r\n  </p>\n<p>Programming Lang/Editor \u2013 C#, Visual Studio\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Version Control - Github</p>\n\r\nACCOLADES:\r\n<p>IEEE GameSIG 2022 Finalist</p>\n<p>FOR A FULL LIST OF DEVELOPERS AND THEIR ROLES, PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAST PLAYTEST BUILDS HERE AND HERE.</p>\n\r\nCHANGES IN THIS BUILD:\r\n<ul><li>Full VFX Pass.</li><li>Optimized and cleaner shadow.</li><li>Additional set pieces to environment.</li><li>Fully working Tactical abilities for each Mercenary.</li><li>Changes to Loadout window in the main menu.</li><li>Added intro cutscene and improved visuals to exfil zone.</li><li>Improved soundscape and SFX.</li><li>Improved invisible walls and flight routes for drones.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T11:33:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/43d/43d7ce6f17c5e1f9ab9d0f21db4ed124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 580, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mechwolf"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
