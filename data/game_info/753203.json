You, the Amulet, will possess anyone who holds you, and you can have your host toss you to new creatures if you think they have something you want.</p>\n<p>Watch out, though -- all weapons and magic items wear out with use.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to play it in glorious 1280x768,\u00a0clone it from GitHub! It uses only Python 3.9 and Pygame 2.1.2. Go to its folder and run</p>\n<p>`python3 main.py`</p>\n<p>If you want to play it in the browser, I made a cut down version that works on\u00a0Trinket.io, but it seems to have problems beyond just the small viewport size. Press the \"Run\" button at the top of the window, and if it crashes, give it another shot.</p>\n<p>I streamed myself playing it on\u00a0YouTube. I'm not a streamer, so I apologize for not talking all the time.</p>\n<p>This game is based on code I wrote for Advent of Code, 2021, which I then extended to form a roguelike game engine for this game. Full development logs for both the game and the game engine are here, on my blog.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T10:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a76e369adca35f7d715bc915753fd019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tipa"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
