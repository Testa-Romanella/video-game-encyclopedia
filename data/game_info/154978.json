It was the first game jam I have been to, so I used the Box Shooter project as a starting point. I don't have any desire to improve on this game an further but if you do, let me know and I can send you on the unity project. </p><p>The game doesn't have a UI for health but the player does, if you die the game just restarts again. Keep in mind it is not finished and has a number of bugs. Also it may run slow in the browser.   </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/72e/72e5d260944d96c072d1591644693d69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AJS Game Development - Alan Stewart"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
