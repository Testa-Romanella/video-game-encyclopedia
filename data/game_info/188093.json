To fly, use the arrow keys, and to shoot your lazier, click with the left side of your mouse on the game itself. You have 10 asteroids per wave, and time to regain your thoughts between each wave before it automatically starts the next wave.</p>\n<p>This game was very hard to make, some of the struggles included my asteroid having seizures, the score not working, and the code not able to be read by the game. It took a long time and I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/22160a4208e35998125b960405bcee76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben.Farris"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
