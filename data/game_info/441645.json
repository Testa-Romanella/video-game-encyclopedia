Do it however you please!</p>\n<p>On your turn you may\u00a0<em>either</em> as a question,\u00a0<em>or</em> guess who the Mystery Person is.</p>\n<p>Some examples for questions would be:\u00a0\"Do they have green eyes?\" \"Are they wearing an accessory?\" \"Do they have facial hair?\" or even \"Are they smiling?\" Be creative with it! If you're familiar with FE:3H lore, you could even ask questions about that. :)</p>\n<p>Whoever guesses their opponent's Mystery Person first wins!\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This weekend my friends and I did a game jam where we all did our own little projects!\u00a0I don't fancy myself as much of a coder having only taken two classes in Python, but I thought that this seemed like just simple enough of an idea to accomplish in one weekend. I ended up learning javascript, which was very easy, actually :D I\u00a0hope you like my little game!\u00a0I had a lot of fun making all the portraits and coding!</p>\n<p>I'm actually an artist!
