Despite countless attempts at it, this is my first ever completed game for the jam and I'm pretty happy with it. This is also my first completed jam game in the Godot engine. In the spirit of open source I have included the source code of the game, but I must say I think it is way too messy to be of use to anyone.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/>The amazing music was made by my friend Svarog, although it was made before the jam, so I excluded the game from the music rating, even though I love the soundtrack. You can listen to the whole song over on his SoundCloud, where he has tons of other quality content. <br/></p>\n<p> The pixel art is for the most part a modified version of this tileset made by 0x72. I originally planned for that to only be work-in-progress art, but I ended up not having enough time to redo the art myself, which is why I also excluded the game from the graphics category, but it is a really cool tileset so I'm happy with it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/00a/00aaca255398abdbf74f924aada1a47d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Vesk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
