Although there was <em>much regret\u00a0</em>at times, mostly dreading the weekend and wondering why we signed up for this, I\u00a0think we managed to come up with a decent prototype and jamed in some more engine features. Did I\u00a0mention we made this in Hazel, our own game engine?<br/></p>\n<p>\"Fragile\" (named after the theme we randomly selected)\u00a0is about protecting your fragile home planet from incoming missiles. Use the WASD keys to move, mouse to look around, and\u00a0click to shoot\u00a0- or you can plug in a controller if you'd prefer.</p>\n<p>We might develop this game a little further in the future, since we have some more ideas and think this has some potential to be a fun little game. Let us know what you think, and thanks for playing!</p><p>Note: MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR GPU DRIVERS TO LATEST! HAZEL REQUIRES VULKAN 1.3 SUPPORT.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T21:05:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9e/b9e5bca9a25df62f250a11515a9c991f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioCherno"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
