Alone and cold, you decide to take a look around, only to find there is no way out and all of the doors are locked. You can hear sounds in the darkness that are closing in. Now you must search for a way out of the house while trying to stay sane, because not everything is as it seems in this house. Find keys and runes to get out while searching for answers to where you are, how you got there, and what lies in the darkness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f9/1f93ec45e8a629aeaa3c57fb0095e19f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameMasterShift Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
