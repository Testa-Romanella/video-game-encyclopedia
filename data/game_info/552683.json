I really need to learn how to\u00a0scope my project better...\u00a0:C (Heh, ironically i should had made something <strong>less</strong> complicated... Oh well... \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af )</p>\n<p>The idea for this game was \"Less ingredients = easier to cook\", originally i tought of doing a <em>cooking mama/combination game</em>\u00a0like game where, the more ingredients meant more minigames, but i scrapped it for a more simple idea, that was that there was a small pool of ingredients and every one of them has an unique minigame, and you have to juggle between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Easy enough!!!</em>\u00a0I tough to myself, <em>i can do that in less than 6 days!!</em> (first day for me is always reserved\u00a0 to come up with an idea) but then 2 days passed and i had in place only the basics of the game...\u00a0 Another 2 days passed and i had all of the system that i needed for the game in place, <em>except</em> for the minigames, <em>making some minigames shouldn't be that hard!!\u00a0</em>I tougt, and oh boy if i was wrong...</p>\n<p>Second last day, and there i was learning about how mutiple cameras interacted with each other and\u00a0how to use\u00a0Render Textures... The other half of the day was spent for making a system to handling mouse input troughout a UI canvas... Who tought that making a minigame was so hard?? (That's why the minigame part feel so rushed and unfinished, that's because it is... Sorry about that, i've tried my best) Final and i'm making the itch page for the game... I have some time left for working at the game, but tihis point does it really matter??</p>\n<p>And there i am, with my ugly looking, barely finished piece of a game that in my mind would had the potential to become a fun game... I mean, yeah it's all part of the learning process, sure, but why it seems to me that i'm not learning anything from my past mistakes?? Or why is also seems that the more games i make, the less fininished and less fun they become??</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Controls are the basics WASD/E to interact. Very intuitive imo :3</p>\n<p>All the code is made during the jam. There are a <strong>grand total</strong> of 0 assets (sprites, music, etc.) in the game so i'm not sure about that one... :3</p>\n<p>Some of the game development process was streamed on twitch. It was a new thing to try for me, and it was very fun to do. I will also (try, but no garauntee on this one) to make a devlog on yt, so if you're interested stay tuned i guess... :3</p>\n\n<p>...Finally, I can play week 5 of Friday Night Funkin!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:02:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d47/d47d949edbc5219f85b91c3266158094.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marxy 37"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
