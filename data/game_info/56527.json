The original Gridrunner was published for various 8-bit systems in 1982 and 1983 with Gridrunner 2 following in 1983. A third installation, Voidrunner was released in 1987. Confusingly, Gridrunner 2 was released in the US under the name Attack of the Mutant Camels, which was also the title used for a totally different game released the same year by Minter.</p>\n<p>The original game was written in a week. The series was revived in 2002 with Gridrunner++, for modern platforms, and followed by later games in the series. In August 2012, a Mac OS X port was released via the Mac App Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-17T17:11:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/259/2594266d718720ba25f9351c3f22c16a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["Jeff Minter"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Quicksilva", "HESware", "Salamander"], "esrb_rating": null}
