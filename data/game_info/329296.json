This week our professor supplied each of us with a topic tailored (taylored) specifically towards each individual respectively. My task was to create a small game world with characters to talk to and interact with.\u00a0Though I originally started with a unity project, I was spending too much time perfecting assets, so I went back to square one and switched to making the game in Bitsy. The focus for me was more on general world building rather than a specific linear story.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Game-A-Week is an intensive project module in which students will create about ten prototype games over the semester, (almost) one per week. The aim of this class is to get students comfortable with the practice of rapid prototyping: working quickly to create a small playable game that effectively proves or disproves a design concept. Drawing influence from game jams, the class will prompt students with weekly thematic, aesthetic, or mechanical constraints (e.g. \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cnature\" or \u201cone-button input\u201d). The hope is that students will practice design, incorporating those lessons into their practice when developing longer-form games in the future.</p>\n<p>Week #9: 11.06.2019 - 18.06.2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Repository</strong></p>\n<p>As the game was made in Bitsy, it has no .git repository.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Naomi Seeling.</p>\n<p>Supervised by\u00a0Prof. Csongor Baranyai\u00a0as part of the Game-A-Week project course in the summer semester of 2019.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e125404c26a12413697eafaa3253181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["naomi seeling"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
