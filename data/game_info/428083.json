The protagonist pilots a power armor called Paladin to fight giant demons by using their own weapons against them.<br />\nThe key components of the swordplay mechanic includes the ability to equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, high versus low attacking and blocking, a rock-paper-scissor weapon type system that grants attack bonuses, and the ability to cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely. The Paladin is the main means to fight enemies but players can eject and also play as the swifter and smaller pilot called a Squire. The Squire uses a laser whip to attack enemies, swing across gaps, and recharge the Paladin\u2019s energy.<br />\nGiant weapons\u2014swords, lances, hammers\u2014hailing from the dark depths of space, blazed across the sky and pierced through historic locations all around the world. Like a declaration of war against mankind, the Parthenon, atop the Acropolis of Athens, was first to be cut right through by an ominous blade.  Upon impact, each of the weapons opened a breach in the fabric of reality and unleashed legions of colossal demons.<br />\nIn anticipation of such unforeseen Earth-threatening events, the International Security Council had formed Gauntlet, a science committee developing super sophisticated defense technologies. Gauntlet discovers that denizens of the Netherworld can only be obliterated by their own weapons. Spirit Weapons are forged with spirits of the deceased and humans can\u2019t brandish them without becoming corrupt by their foul power... However, a machine would be immune to demonic corruption! Gauntlet recommissions Flame, a former rescue operations android, to become a Squire and take control of the last remaining Paladin unit, a state of the art power armor capable of wielding Spirit Weapons.<br />\nTo arms! Overseeing their operations from aboard the Avalon, their flying headquarters, Gauntlet is ready. The showdown between mankind\u2019s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun! It&#39;s up to Squire Flame and her Paladin named Grit to defeat all Weapon Keepers, and ultimately face off against Ravenous, the sinister leader of the invasion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-02T19:11:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/740/74004bd96c8e432782afe6d4e5e9320b.jpg", "website": "http://panzerpaladin.com/", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 31, "owned": 694, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tribute Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Tribute Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
