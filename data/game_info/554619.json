It took me about 24 hours to do it, I know the Gotm.io game jam started almost 2 weeks ago but I am a busy man.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>In Gamma War you can destroy everything as long as the color of your tank is the same as the object .</strong></p>\n<p>In html the game is a bit annoying to play, but the executables work very well, if you can't play in the browser you can download the game, give it a try. <strong>What counts in a game jam is the game itself, not where you play it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I know the game jam instructions say to upload the game to gotm.io, and I did, but for some reason it doesn't load the game. So I upload the HTML directly to itch.io.</strong></p>\n<p>I follow the instruction, upload the game to gotm.io, dowload the embed file, upload the embed file.... for me did not work. <br/></p>\n<p>I would love to have started earlier to avoid technical difficulties like this one.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Here is the link to Gotm.io</strong></p>\n<p>https://gotm.io/manuelnaim/gammawar<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T10:33:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d3338b9f37e2beafa90d36bac6538d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ManuelNaim"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
