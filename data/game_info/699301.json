Platform across various levels, picking up fuel for your lantern as you go. When your lantern runs out of fuel, light disappears from the world all together. This game is a series of short, one screen platforming levels.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow keys: Move and jump</p>\n<p>Tab: Rewind time</p>\n<p>Escape: Exit application</p>\n\n<p>Mostly a project messing around to try out some game design ideas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking forward:</p><p>Player hitbox. The player hit box feels really bad sometimes, knocking you out of the way when trying to jump up to a platform, and making it hard to gauge the edges of the platform. Need to make a non circle, non square hit box.<br/></p>\n<p>Levels. There needs to be more levels, and the ones already there probably need more tuning. Some of the levels use the time rewind mechanic alright, but not fully thought through yet.<br/></p>\n<p>New art assets. The enemies use the same art as the player. Also, there's no distinction in art between the objects that can be rewound, and those that can't.</p>\n<p>Sound effects. With no sound, it's really hard to gauge how you're moving once the screen turns black. I was planning on having it so most levels you'd run out of light, and have to finish it in darkness, but it was simply too frustrating without sound, so I'd want to try that again with sfx for walking, jumping, and landing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:25:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/800/800ea86697810b5b22bdd2dfdacaef7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whyburn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
