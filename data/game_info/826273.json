It was done over a period of 2.5 days.</p>\n<p>The theme for the game jam was \"Decoy\".</p>\n<p>Team Name: \"The Manticores\"</p><p>We utilized free, pre-made assets, but made a majority of the assets ourselves.\u00a0If more time was available, we would have liked to prioritize refining our assets and add much more detail to them.</p>\n<p>In-game Notes:</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of a game jam, not every mini-game is complete. We kept in the second mini-game which is still using placeholders. There was not enough time to create and animate assets for this mini-game. The mini-game was envisioned to be a type of \"treasure hunt\", where the player would have to sift through various objects to find specific ones. This mini-game is found in the cheese and jam shop</p><p><strong><em>---------------------- SPOILER\u00a0<strong>----------------------</strong></em></strong></p><p>This game depicts an\u00a0exaggeration of addiction.\u00a0\u00a0Addictions act as decoys in our lives, placeholders that lure us away from reality.\u00a0\u00a0We personified addiction and wanted to make it seem like they are a friend. There to support and seemingly help us. <br/><br/>They are shown to take the player to a dessert store to fix their sugar craving. When the player fails to collect enough items to add to their high (depicted in the UI bar above the screen), their high drops. When the player's high is low, the screen glitches to show the reality of the world. Addiction serves as a means to escape from this reality.</p><p>The mini-game (that is actually completed) also makes use of the theme, \"decoy\". Certain items change last minute into a different item, tricking the player into unwillingly changing their high.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T11:22:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/87006a9606f9d720ef27637a7f78761c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MemoryGhost"], "genres": ["Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
