{"id": 381714, "slug": "sneeter", "name": "Sneeter", "name_original": "Sneeter", "description": "Welcome to Sneeter\r\n<p>Build up your clout from nothing and become Sneeter Famous in this roguelike social media simulator we made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 45!!</p>\n<p>Sneeter.com has very refined tastes, and every run you need to find out what they are by Sneeting into the abyss. Do they like dogs? Do they like cats? The only way to find out is to Sneet about it. If you make a good Sneet, then you get clout. And if you make a bad Sneet, well\u2026</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll just have to find out (actually though you just lose HP).</p>\n<ul><li>Each runthrough, people will like and dislike different things. It's up to you to find out what based on the reactions you get and use that to increase your clout. If you Sneet something like \"I like dogs\" and it gets a positive reception, then you now know people like dogs and if you Sneet more good things about dogs, people will like those too. However if you then Sneet something like \"I think dogs should be able to vote\" and people dislike your Sneet, then you know that people really hate the concept voting -\u00a0the idea of dogs, something they like, voting, something they hate, is abhorrent to them.\u00a0</li><li>Build Sneets by collecting templates and words to put into the templates, whether using ones you get for free in the mail, or using ones you steal from other peoples' Sneets.</li><li>Attack determines how much clout you get, Defense determines how much damage you take when you make a bad Sneet, and HP determines how much HP you start with.</li></ul>\n<p>If you want your Twitter/Discord name to be in our game you can send it to us\u00a0here\u00a0and we'll add you after Ludum Dare is over!!</p>\r\nKnown issues:\r\n<ul><li>If you die the UI freezes up and you can\u2019t click anything. Though this is a proper recreation of what happens when you die it is not intentional.</li><li>If you go to make a Sneet but don\u2019t have the proper phrases/words to complete the Sneet, you\u2019ll be stuck there forever.</li><li>Sometimes you\u2019ll make a Sneet so bad it kills you in one hit. You are not supposed to take that much damage at once.</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Programming by</p>\n<ul><li>rob fichman\u00a0https://twitter.com/bobacupcake</li></ul>\n<p>Art, writing, and game design by</p>\n<ul><li>adam\u00a0https://twitter.com/adam_s_j</li><li>andrea \u2018play kid icarus uprising\u2019 colorsplash\u00a0https://twitter.com/ruddyroad</li><li>ago https://twitter.com/agostaini</li><li>andrew\u00a0https://twitter.com/legsrjust4show</li><li>carmela \u201cg\u2019raha tia final fantasy 14 lover\u201d dansen\u00a0https://twitter.com/carmeladansen</li><li>goldy\u00a0https://twitter.com/sarazarann</li><li>lillie (our dog)</li><li>elly\u00a0https://twitter.com/banananaki</li><li>dylan\u00a0https://twitter.com/dylanrexed</li><li>james\u00a0https://twitter.com/GusherGauntlet</li><li>peepo\u00a0https://twitter.com/beeebobebo</li><li>rob fichman\u00a0https://twitter.com/bobacupcake</li><li>static\u00a0https://twitter.com/staticcolour</li></ul>\n<p>Fonts are from Chevy Ray\u2019s Pixel fonts!</p>\n<p>and a big thank you to everyone who donated their display names to us!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T07:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/675/675f120b2240326061295becfdfe58c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bubble wand games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
