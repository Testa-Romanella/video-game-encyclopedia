You control a robot that has the capability to perform\u00a0 various actions, but you can only control it with five keys: up, down, left, right, and Z. This means you won't have access to all your actions at once. You are *ahem*\u00a0<strong>out of controls</strong>. You'll have to get creative\u00a0 to use all the actions required to escape.</p>\n<p>When you come across a monitor, press x to access it. There you can change all of your key bindings. Simply select the key you want to change on the left, and select the action you want to bind to it on the right. By carefully\u00a0changing your bindings, you will be able to use whatever actions you want when the time comes.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:25:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3a/b3add7f8f7160fb7130ab4ba6d3a6949.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Polobu"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
