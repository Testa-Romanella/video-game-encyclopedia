People all over are isolating themselves at home, defending their computers from the virus. This game has two states. The first is in your cozy cabin, walking around, and the second is on the computer. The computer level is based on missile command; you shoot down viruses before they can reach your computer and upload themselves.\u00a0 Basic controls are W, A, S, D for movement in the cabin level. Point and click shooting for the computer level. This was my first time with pixel art in this capacity as I am a programmer by trade, so please, any type of feedback to the art, design, or gameplay would be amazing. Enjoy and stay safe :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T03:26:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1c/b1cd3d0c236fee127e9e40406378e937.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joe10111"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
