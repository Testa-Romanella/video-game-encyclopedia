Aim your spells upwards or downwards for even more bouncing madness. Spells can only ricochet a certain number of times, but this is refreshed by reflecting. Reflected spells travel even faster than regular ones!</p>\n<p>Details of the controls can be found on the main menu in game. You'll need controllers to play, but one player can use the keyboard if they wish.</p>\n<p>Choose from a variety of different levels. Make sure to vary your tactics to take into account the terrain! Use those ricochets to your advantage!</p>\n<p>If you have issues with controllers not working try unplugging them then plugging them back in, or restarting the game.\u00a0It's probably a weird Unity bug.</p><p>Art by the amazing Keith:\u00a0https://keithorkeith.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db75cab67a4fdb91952ddaf79846c5b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ztuu"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
