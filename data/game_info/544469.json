Play as Will, a college freshman who ends up being put in a fraternity home with 5 girls. Some of the girls are thrilled with having a boy in the home, while others, not so much. Try to win the friendship (and possibly love) of the girls, as well as trying to adapt to the new college lifestyle, being away from your parents, and learning to watch out for your grandfather, who randomly calls you on your phone to yell some crazy, nonsensical thing at you.</p><p>If this project gets enough support I will:</p><ul><li>Make this a full game with a complete story.</li><li>Have multiple endings in the game.</li><li>Add music and (possibly) sound effects.</li><li>Add various poses for the characters (possibly).</li><li>Add secrets...?</li><li>And perhaps more!</li></ul>\n<p>Disclaimer: I own none of the backgrounds used in this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T04:17:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147cc080a875a22fd52ecd2284cd94bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bluemuck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
