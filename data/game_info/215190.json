The basic concept is Little Alchemy mixed with Polandball meme, which user can mix elements to create items and countries. I got lots of ideas for this game. It was supposed that the country can do different action based on what they are holding. It was even supposed the terrain is editable, and the countryballs can react with the terrain.<br />\nHowever, the game concept seems too big for me. Because i need to do 3d art, animation, programming for each item. There will be too much workload for too little gameplay. That&#39;s why i abandoned this project, and use the artwork assets to create a light scale mobile game, which is Polandball Not Safe For World.<br />\nBut now the situation is changed. After i posted the gameplay video to youtube, i see players like this concept. So i probably will update it. If i get enough funding for my Polandball Not Safe For World Goodest Edition. I can outsource my workload to freelancers (especially art work). and i probably can update this game as a side project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-16T10:56:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6ad1c5ec2e9f46e815a7b0955031fde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Game Gear"], "developers": ["SunnyChow"], "genres": ["Sports", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
