This project was made for the GameDev.tv Community Jam, I had a lot of fun making it and I hope you all like it. The game is still in early asses, so there are still a lot of things missing. Especially a tutorial,\u00a0\u00a0sorry it isn't in this version but it will be coming soon. Black Crystal 7 was made in only a month and this is my first solo game. It's filled with guns, enemy's, themed world, and power ups. I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T05:04:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/497/49710e8d33a569f29dbba726b97916ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["RRgamer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
