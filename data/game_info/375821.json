Just as you began reading over the last one she sent to you, it blew out of your hands and through the window outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This was created for an Advanced Level Design class, and as such, it's an incomplete game. The aim was to create a playable level that was designed well. The assets for the walls and floor inside of the main house you enter were the only thing created by me, although there were several 3D models that I never got the chance to properly import. Because most of the assets in this game weren't made by me, a lot of it doesn't make much sense visually. I tried my best.</p>\n<p>I may never update this because I have other projects that I'll be moving on to, but if you have any constructive criticism or little bugs that you noticed, feel free to tell me so I can apply this knowledge to future games I'll be working on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can visit my channel here to view the milestones made for this project, which go over why I did certain things or cut other ideas.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T06:42:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68a/68a36033714ad2ad0cc4799d48b8db40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keely"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
