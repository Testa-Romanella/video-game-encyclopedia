By 1992 there were also MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amstrad CPC versions available. It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.<br />\nThe game was the first Dizzy game not to be developed entirely by Dizzy&#39;s creators, the Oliver Twins. Instead, whilst they were focusing on other projects, Magicland Dizzy was designed by Neal Vincent and coded by external developer Big Red Software. The Oliver Twins retained design-approval oversight.<br />\nThe game is sometimes alternatively known by its development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible at the top of the game screen, behind the player&#39;s score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series games again. The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms. A NES version titled Wonderland Dizzy was developed in 1993 and later released in October 2015.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1990-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61af6b19a8aa72174770963136dbc8f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 359, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "PC", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Codemasters", "Big Red Software", "Oliver Twins"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
