The first line, the main line, requires the player to interact with environment and grabble object to solve certain puzzle, and finally ends with player's escape from the zombies. The second line, a hidden one, enable player to obtain powerful weapon, and ends with defeating all the zombies by the players. The player start the game with sanity of 30, and\u00a0die when the sanity drops to 0.\u00a0While continuing on each of the lines, players can increase sanity by triggering the med kit on the ground, or losing sanity by triggering traps like saws and dead bodies. Death will not lead player to the very beginning of the entire game depending on which stages player is at.</p>\n<p>Control: WSAD, mouse, and LMB for interacting and grabbing items</p>\n<p>Attributes:</p>\r\nBoxes pack\r\n<p>Aleksey Kozhemyakin</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/boxes-pack-32717<br/></p>\r\nDirty Chainsaw\r\n<p>Game Splotch</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/dirty-chainsaw-154761</p>\r\nFlashlight\r\n<p>RRFreelance\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/electronics/flashlight-18972</p>\r\nFree Horror Track + 12 Loops\r\n<p>x345</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/free-horror-track-12-loops-55161</p>\r\nHorror Assets\r\n<p>Lukas Bobor</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/horror-assets-69717</p>\r\nHorror Axe\r\n<p>ESsplashkid</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/horror-axe-107507</p>\n\r\nHorror Sound Atmospheres and FX\r\n<p>neocrey</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/ambient/horror-sound-atmospheres-and-fx-96731</p>\r\nHospital Horror Pack\r\n<p>FoeJofMay</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/hospital-horror-pack-44045</p>\r\nModern Zombie Free\r\n<p>Artalasky</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/modern-zombie-free-58134</p>\r\nModular Medieval Lanterns\r\n<p>Alexandr Voevodov</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/modular-medieval-lanterns-85527</p>\r\nRust Key\r\n<p>Aleksn09</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/rust-key-167590</p>\r\nSurgical Instruments - Free hospital props\r\n<p>Mixall</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/tools/surgical-instruments-free-hospital-props-199472</p>\r\nYughues Free Metal Materials\r\n\n\n<p>Nobiax / Yughues</p>\n\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/metals/yughues-free-metal-materials-12949<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T10:51:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6b/f6ba9586c3af77ae9bb933a4f2523747.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Charles Peachy", "VChahaha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
