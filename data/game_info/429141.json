The longer you hold the fire button the more powerful your shot will be. To aim - move your phone! You might even need to spin right around!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the open beta for my game I've been making over the last few months. Aim you phone in real life to aim at targets or badguyses. Try shoot them all before they get you! The game currently has three different modes but Im hoping to add more. The game is still in development so any suggestions are very welcome. There are a few bugs as well.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T08:27:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb33ca4ad5ca0d10e362e3e3f9971b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["NateDoggGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
