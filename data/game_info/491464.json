XD are there any technical problems? is the game missing something (more story, goals, correction of difficulty of cpu-player...)? ...therefore I would like to test the game for a while as a beta version.<br/><br/><strong>ya, there is still a lot to do!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:08:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66a/66aaadc4559f73790e33b366be379d10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelNadja"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PixelNadja"], "esrb_rating": null}
