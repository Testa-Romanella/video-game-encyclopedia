Unfortunately for you, money is tight and a contract just made itself available. You need the cash, so you take up the delivery and deliver the goods. The return journey however took a turn for the worst. All the other safer routes home have been shuttered because of the snowstorms. Now you must cross the thin and perilous ice bridge in one sitting as the day turns to night. If it's not all downhill from here, it's down into the drink. Take care.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>A to steer left</li><li>D to steer right</li><li>Truck accelerates by itself.</li></ul>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<ul><li>Designer and Director: GEORGE aka 'The Bonsai Treehouse'\u00a0georgecheal.wixsite.com/bonsaitreehouse</li><li>General Programmer: RYAN aka 'Deconstructed Mind' https://twitter.com/DeconstructedM</li><li>Vehicle Programmer: O.
