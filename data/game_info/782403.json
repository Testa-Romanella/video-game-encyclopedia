In a pinch he can use a holy blast to get rid of all the goblins on the screen at the cost of his score and some of his health. This incentivizes dodging and weaving instead of blasting your way through.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T05:53:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/825/825556027af7c0c12af984f43970216d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["congrets"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
