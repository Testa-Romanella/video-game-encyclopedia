As long as the master of the dimensional mystery can master the fate of the earth, the evil dimensional beasts know these, they<br/><br/>Abduct the earth maiden and lock them in the most dangerous place in the universe, this place is the great source.<br/><br/>The legendary source of great attraction is the place full of the greatest gravity, because this powerful gravity can not even escape light, so people do not know the mystery of the source of great attraction, only know that our Milky Way galaxy has been around this powerful source of gravity.<br/><br/>Enter, my warriors, into the great attractor, save the earth maiden, and save the future of mankind!<br/><br/><br/><br/>The grand source project is a game that completely breaks the traditional jigsaw puzzle. Yes, who says a jigsaw must be a \"picture\"? Our jigsaw is a fully dynamic young woman (actually, even the posture is a bit titillating?). . Compared with traditional puzzles, dynamic puzzles are obviously more fun to play. In the game, we will add different challenges, not only time challenges, but also memory challenges, disruption challenges and so on. The secondary beasts will release their various abilities and hinder the success of jigsaw puzzles.<br/><br/><br/>The project will be the first project to be developed carefully by our studio. The game will continue to update more levels and characters, and more creative ideas will be added in the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>The first dynamic puzzle game<br/></li><li>Three main characters of earth girl<br/></li><li>20 different levels of difficulty<br/></li><li>Many star series meitu<br/></li><li>Excellent background music for more than 10 tracks<br/></li><li>30 less likely achievements<br/></li><li>Full language support</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>MAYBE IT A VERY HARD GAME!
