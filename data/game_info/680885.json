Made during a weekend in early\u00a0September 2021.</p>\n<p>This was a short project where I adapted some rules a friend had come up with, into a digital Tic-tac-toe game. The goals of these rules are to increase the strategy needed and to decrease the frequency of\u00a0draws.</p>\n<p>The game is a competitive\u00a0local game.\u00a0No AI or online play is currently available,\u00a0but you can easily screen-share it with a friend\u00a0if you want to play it online.<br/></p>\n<p>Modes:</p>\n<p><strong>Normal three in a row.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Get three of your symbol in a row to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Three \"three in a row\" in a row.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Play on the small boards to win a space on the big board. Whoever gets three in a row on the big board wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Three \"three in a row\" in a row - Advanced version.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The main game mode. You still play on the small boards to win spaces on the big board.\u00a0But now your choice of small board is limited by the position of the previous move. A border appears around the small board you must place on. Note: if a player would have to place on a board that is unavailable, then that player gets to play on any board they want.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T06:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/502/5029e263c3deb921030ca4915d86018d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KiteKnight"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
