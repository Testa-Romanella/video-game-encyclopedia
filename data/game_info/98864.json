Human nature makes us ambitious and greedy. Dive into a high-seas adventure as a ship\u2019s captain that must solve the problem of an imminent mutiny. Discover the secrets your sailors keep, and attain all the information needed to uncover the mutineer. </p>\n<p>With <strong>Rats will kiss the gunner's daughter</strong> we\u2019ve wanted to take on the challenge of generating a game with content created in a simple and functional way. Firstly, we turned the theme around, taking \u201c<em>you are running out of power</em>\u201d to mean the social kind of power, and not the mechanical or physical interpretation of the phrase that the mind first goes to. Also we\u2019ve created a game environment that puts a lot of focus on human behaviour.</p>\n<p>We hope you fully enjoy the experience and above all, that you make the mutineer kiss the gunner's daughter!</p>\n<p><strong>Game Instructions:</strong></p>\n<p>This game lasts 5 days. On the 6th day you will have to execute the mutineer. Every day you will ask each sailor on your ship a different question.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have three options: </p>\n<p><em>Blue button</em>: ask peacefully. </p>\n<p><em>Red button</em>: Use violence to get the information. This action will cost you a coin (to hire a bully).</p>\n<p><em>Yellow button</em>: Bribe the sailor to get the information. This action will cost you a coin.</p>\n<p>Each day have two coins to spend. You can't save up coins to use the next day.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>We\u00a0 <strong>strongly </strong>recommend you to write down the information you acquire. These sailors will say many things and it may be hard to remember all of it.\r\n</li><li>Every time you play the game, the sailors will have a different name and appearance (face, head and body). Don't be afraid to give it a second try!</li><li>Extra point question: where is this ship exactly from?</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0We have removed the unfinished language option (it was available in the windowed mode because it wasn't set at 16:9).</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The game icon wasn't set correctly.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Now it is possible to see the results of the game: who was the\u00a0 mutineer (in case you lose) and who were all the members of your crew (if you succeed).</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>The player can choose to execute a sailor anytime in the game, so you don't have to wait 5 days if you know who the mutineer is.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>We've updated the font. The new one is quite a bit more readable.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>32 bit version</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(and always remember to be a good captain!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59a/59abba2216427db1d8398fd43ca1bc0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr.Houdini"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
