How many can you find?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Originally created in 48 hours\u00a0for the 25th gm(48) gamejam</strong></p>\n<p>Game by Baku - @Bakufreak</p>\n<p>Music by Rohbert - @AlexRohbert</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1.1.1:</p><ul><li>Increased default window size which was accidentally left very small in 1.1.0.</li></ul><p>1.1.0:</p><ul><li>Various changes to the game world, including new hidden areas and coins.</li><li>Bats now follow player character's head instead of feet.</li><li>Fixed a bug where spear platforms would become invisible and have collision enabled in incorrect rooms.</li><li>Added new ending.</li><li>Updated spike sprite.</li><li>Added new icons that are shown when aiming a spear at a moving platform, or at something outside the camera's view.</li><li>Added new spear breaking effect when throwing a spear at enemies or moving platforms.</li><li>Added new sound effects.</li><li>Added colliders around the moving platform at the end, and made the ending camera state properly reset in cases where it should reset.</li><li>Tweaked ground pound.
