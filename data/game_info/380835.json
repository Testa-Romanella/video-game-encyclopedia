You\u2019ll also have Stratagems available that you can play on various targets.<br />\nIt is in essence a game about military conquest, but you will also engage in diplomacy, budgets, organizational management, your economy, infrastructure, design and many more details.<br />\nThe game has a very procedural design that will ensure re-playability and experimentation. Not only are the Planets procedurally generated, also the equipment you are fighting with is.<br />\nA separate system for discovery of Techs, Formation Types and Model Types and their research/development also ensures that you\u2019ll have to work with different playing pieces each game.<br />\nThe game universe is designed to evoke the feeling of being on another planet in some dark future, but at the same time to stay familiar. It is a game that does not deny it is a game, but it has a strong thematic focus on keeping things relatively realistic.<br />\nFor a strategy game there is a relatively strong roleplaying angle where you\u2019ll need to keep your leaders happy in order for them to do their jobs well and not get any ideas of rebellion.<br />\nThere is a lot of potential micro management to engage in and to offset this the game has Stratagems that allow sweeping actions by just clicking the \u2018play stratagem\u2019 button. This allows a mental break from the micro stuff, for helping the player get out of a fix and enforcing the thematics as well.<br />\nThis game is one of the most ambitious games VR Designs ever made.<br />\nIt is a very rich experience and a truly unique game that is no cookie-cutter of something you have already seen before<br />\nFeatures<br />\nMost turns you&#39;ll have to make Decisions on events occuring in your Zones, with your Leaders or with third parties (for example: cults, crime syndicates)<br />\nProcedurally generated Planets according to the rules of Astrobiology that include Climates, Rainfall, Deserts, Snow, Glaciers, Lava streams, Deep Forests, Alien Evolution, Mountain chains, Resources, Rivers, Biohazard Level and Respiratory Hazard Level, etc.<br />\nDetailed Combat Resolution taking into account factors as Readiness, Morale, Supplies, Experience, Entrenchment, Landscapes, Recon, Rivers, Weapon and Armor Technologies, Concentric Attacks, Leader Skills and Posture Stratagems.<br />\nDiscover and Operationalize over a 100 different Formation Types, each in 3 different sizes (like Infantry Armor, Heavy Assault Brigade, etc)<br />\nDiscover and Design 30+ different Model Types (like Light Tank, Walkers, Missile Launchers, etc\u2026)<br />\nThe game starts at a Low Tech Level, but at the end of the Tech Tree you\u2019ll find knowledge that allows you to build (for example): Laser Guns, Atomic Missile Launchers, Walkers, Shield-Generators and even ICBMs.<br />\nDiscover and Research over a 100 different Tech Fields (like Assault Rifle, Algae Vats)<br />\nUnits can pick up supplies from a road hex inside the Logistical Network in a certain operational supply range.<br />\nYou can extend your Logistics Network capabilities by building Roads or Rails as well as constructing Truck Stations, Maglev Station and Supply Base Assets.<br />\nLeaders can be recruited and appointed to become Zone Governors, Council Directors, Army Commanders or Advisors.<br />\nLeaders can have over 40 different Skills and can receive Leader Feats to augment their Stats<br />\nYou can play Stratagems (cards) on other Regimes, Leaders or Zones. Over 150+ available.<br />\nUnsatisfied Leaders could leave you, rebel or turn corrupt.<br />\nLeaders tend to band together in Factions.<br />\nFactions will put forward Demands on you, like asking you to conquer a neighbour or raise your Tech Level.<br />\nYou either have a Parliament, Senate or Politburo in your nation, you will be able to change system during a game<br />\nOn the Diplomacy front: Minor Regimes can be coerced to become a vassal or even join you. Major Regimes can be tied into a number of pact and deals to ensure a peaceful coexistence.<br />\nRealistic supply model where running out stuff always has consequences. Lack of Oil will immobilize your troops, lack of Ammo will for sure stop any offensive operations and a lack of Food might just starve and kill your Troops and Populace.<br />\nDifferent kinds of Mining operations possible: Water, Metal, Rare Metals, Oil and Radioactives.<br />\nProspecting is often necessary for discovering Resources that could be mined<br />\nScavenge Ruins and discover rare Artifacts.<br />\nSupports multi-player</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-08T06:24:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/447497b65599cc6d64b15cd70cef7238.jpg", "website": "https://www.matrixgames.com/game/shadow-empire", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 27, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VR Designs"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Slitherine"], "esrb_rating": null}
