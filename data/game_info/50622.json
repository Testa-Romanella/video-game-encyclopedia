{"id": 50622, "slug": "solar-wind", "name": "Solar Wind", "name_original": "Solar Wind", "description": "JimJams games are a small, indie development team with a love for the retro games of the '80's and 90's. We only develop games that embrace that era, aiming to provide true classic styled gaming, with a massive retro feel, maybe with a slight hint of what these games would have been with a little more processing power.<br/><br/>We don't aim to develop AAA games, but simply to bring our passion for a time gone by to those who love truly classic themed and inspired games. If this is a genre and era that you love, then our games are for you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Solar Wind is our take on the classic sidescrolling shoot 'em ups of the past. Develop, customise and upgrade your fleets to fight, face on, an unknown enemy menace.  Fight in deep space, fly through asteroid belts, battle across desert, jungle and forest planets in an effort to stem the alien threat. Mine asteroids, moons and planets for vital resources to fund the onging war. Send your best pilots into the greatest danger, or choose to hold them back as you hurl rookies into the fray.<br/><br/>Solar Wind encompasses many elements of the classic shoot 'em ups, combined with a level for strategic thinking as only you can decide how best to deploy your resources in the ongoing war.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5cbbd1a36c83c1f151527c2bbfa17ca.jpg", "website": "http://www.jimjamsgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 13}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimJamsGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["JimJamsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
