The character walks automatically and cannot be controlled directly. Instead the player needs to put up signs and objects in the environment to help him around and to avoid contact with monsters. Signs are collected in a vertical bar on the right side of the screen. Farther levels include new types of items. The game contains about 100 levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T07:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e8d65bd36c2e5c283aa820cbf6008b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Erbe Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
