Touching a ghost results in loss of a life. Losing all of your lives results in a game over.</p>\n<p>Collecting items and eating ghosts fills up your</p>\n<p>Pac-Meter. Fill it completely to level up. Things start off easy while the ghosts only use cars, but as the level rises, ghosts use more vehicles. Beware of frenzies and dark levels!</p>\n<p>Power-Ups and other Items:</p>\n<p>Fruit: Collect these to earn points. The fruit bonus gets bigger for every fruit eaten.</p>\n<p>Galaxian: Appears rarely, but collecting it will award you with 7,650 points.</p>\n<p>Power Pellet: Turns ghosts purple, allowing you to eat them for points. Useful in a sticky situation.</p>\n<p>Special-Pac: Grants you an extra life, allowing you to take an extra hit before a game over.</p>\n<p>Lucky-Pac: Completely fills the Pac-Meter.</p>\n<p>Fairy: Occasionally appears when a ghost is eaten, touching it will allow them to gift you a power-up.</p>\n<p>Helmet: Makes you immune to ghost drops (tiny ghosts that ghosts drop when riding planes).
