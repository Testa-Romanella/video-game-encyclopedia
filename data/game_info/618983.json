Your job is to score the ball in the goal - a concept as old as time. However, in\u00a0<em>Chainball!</em>, the only way for you to advance the ball is to strike it with the ball-and-chain attached to your ankle. Use physics, timing, strategy, and a bit of luck to fight for your life in\u00a0<em>Chainball!</em></p>\n<p>This game has modes for human versus AI, as well as human versus human. See Controls for more details.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Orange team (left-side): <strong>WASD</strong><br/>Stripes team (right-side, in Human Player mode): <strong>Arrow Keys</strong><br/><strong>Escape</strong> to pause the game.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p><strong>The Spin\u00a0Move</strong> - A very powerful tactic is the spin move. This move, in which a player spins almost 360 degrees to build momentum, is very good for attacking or breaking up a potential goal.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Dragger</strong> - Since the player's bodies do not collide with the ball, you can use your ball-and-chain as a sort of leash to lead the ball around.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Flick\u00a0</strong>- Running towards the ball will result in your chain following behind you. Cancelling this velocity by running in the other direction will leave your ball-and-chain dead in it's tracks - a very effective defensive maneuver.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:50:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/90771dd7a466811b2ce81ebc93337350.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Windmill Games", "ebernerd"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
