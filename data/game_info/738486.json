The game story is  explored through the eyes of its protagonist, Rhoan. The game is based  on the three design pillars: (1) endearing narrative, (2) captivating  atmosphere, and (3) joy of exploration. The pillars are respectively  implemented through the character\u2019s rediscovery of the state of his  world. They are shown through the interplay of simple game mechanics,  explorable level, and appropriate visual and audio feedback, and through  not only geographical, but also mechanical, and narrative discoveries  that await players in the game.\r\n    </p>\n<p>This project was made according to the assignment brief which was to  design and develop a short single-player video game focused on narrative  rather than gameplay mechanics. The project was also meant to be  influenced by a character from any entertaining industry of the team\u2019s  choosing. The aim was to make a single-player adventure game set on an  alien desert planet that would reflect today\u2019s real-world issues related  to climate change and the negative effects of desertification. The  project was developed in the Unity3D game engine over approximately two  months.\r\n    </p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<ul><li>Play as Rhoan, a young scholar who is trying to invert the effects of global warming to make his planet inhabitable again\r\n</li><li>Use the standard WASD movement to navigate through the map\r\n</li><li>Use the mouse to rotate the third-person camera\r\n</li><li>Use the \u201cSpace\u201d key to jump and the \u201cE\u201d key to interact with objects\r\n</li><li>Progress through the story by moving from one gameplay area to another\r\n</li><li>Interact with magical crystals that corrupt certain areas\r\n</li><li>Collect up to six magical orbs that are scattered across the level\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:11:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fe/5fe09608f752f76d88450f14ead0339f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nina Makes Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
