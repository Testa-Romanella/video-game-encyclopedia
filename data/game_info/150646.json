In this game, you, the player, must manipulate your way through waves of plitkas (colorful, gem-like tiles) that fall from the sky and fill up your game board! Move the plitkas left, right, up, and down, and try to match four or more horizontally or vertically to clear them and score points! The plitkas will keep coming, slowly at first, but much faster as time goes on! Survive as long as possible and go for the high score!</p>\n<p>10/25/17: Plitka is now available as free software! Get it on GitHub here: https://github.com/ErikLetson/plitka<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/>Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys control your cursors, and the WASD keys to manipulate the plitkas you highlight. You can move the plitkas in any cardinal direction. Hold the left SHIFT key to activate 'cursor drop' mode, which will cause your horizontal cursor to follow the plitkas as they fall.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/653/653fdbe1c9e900c8f1b635c9332ecdb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HellaMagellan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
