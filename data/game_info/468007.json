Be sure to read how to play the game first before booting it up.</p>\r\nThe Premise\r\n<p>You start in a world full of healthy green tiles. However, among these healthy green tiles are red \"infected\" tiles. These tiles spread themselves in all non-diagonal directions and their spread is completely out of your control.</p>\n<p>Additionally, tiles that are infected for too long die. However, you can cure infected tiles with a cure. Doing this not only makes the tile healthy again, but also prevents it from getting infected again, acting as a barrier.</p>\n<p>Lastly, researching dead tiles with an exclamation mark on them gives you 1 cure. When a tile dies, it may be able to be researched, giving you a cure.</p>\n<p>The goal is to strategically cure infected cells to stop the infection in a way that leaves the most cells healthy as possible when the game ends (when all infected tiles are gone).</p>\n<p>Finally, the tiles and their colors go as follows. Healthy tiles are green, infected are red, cured are blue, dead are black.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\nWASD - Camera Control<br/>\r\nScroll Wheel - Zoom in/out<br/>\r\nLeft click (holdable) - Research tile<br/>\r\nRight click - Cure tile<br/>\r\nESC - Exit to title screen<br/>\n</p>\r\nScores to beat\r\n<p>I mean come on, don't you want to beat the developers at their own game?</p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Person\r\n    Score\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    [placeholder]14\r\n    930 \r\n  \r\n    Whodiduexpect\r\n    820 \r\n  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n<p>Thanks for reading through this!
