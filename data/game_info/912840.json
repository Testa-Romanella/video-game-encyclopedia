These may have ingredients or add some that the game itself does not inform you of. In those times, you'll need to consult the Employee Handbook to know what you'll need to include. You can't open up the sandwich, sides, or drinks to look back through what you have already for the order, so if an order gets Rejected, toss it in the trash to reset what's in your hands, check the register for the current order's receipt, and try again.</p>\n<p>All the fun of fast food, without the rush. Honest! Those who work for Pops have nothing to gain from lying.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T16:23:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c7/3c7f0f3b25191f36e3cc4ee285f9b6b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CannibalInteractive"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
