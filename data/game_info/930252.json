{"id": 930252, "slug": "skidface", "name": "SkidFace!", "name_original": "SkidFace!", "description": "<p><strong>Welcome to SkidFace!</strong></p>\n<p>SkidFace is my first large Unity project created in 2019. Please remember that my game development skills have improved a lot since then, and that this is a reflection of my early days with Unity. That said, I am still proud of SkidFace, even if there are numerous improvements to make. Apart from adding two other levels,\u00a0I have not worked on it much since it's launch, but it is still being played by many people. In fact, so many people have started playing it recently that the hosting service I used for SkidFace actually required I upgrade my plan to a paid one\u00a0since so many people were accessing it. That is why I have moved it to Itch. Loading times and reliability are much better now that I am not using Netlify. However, if you have any suggestions regarding the game, please feel free to ask me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T16:40:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/7320ed6c940456199ef1a9db1f73c56a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SkidFace"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
