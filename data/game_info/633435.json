Solve problems and reuse your solutions to write ever-more-complex logic.<h3>Start from scratch</h3><br/>Start with the simplest mathematical primitives. Everything is a function, and functions can be used to build everything else.<h3>Solve increasingly complex problems</h3><br/>Use your previous solutions as black boxes, and use them as building blocks to build more complex solutions.<h3>Compare your solutions</h3><br/>Compare your solutions against other players, and against your Steam friends, both in efficiency and simplicity.<h3>Workshop support</h3><br/>Create your own levels and share them with the community.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T02:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/987801849cf40aa66c6342d5f35418d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["yancouto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Marvellous Soft"], "esrb_rating": null}
