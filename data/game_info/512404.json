Survive... <em>REPEAT.</em></strong></p><p>This is <em><strong>Disc Room RL</strong></em>, a quasi-roguelike interpretation of Devolver Digital's <strong>Disc Room</strong>; developed for <em>the Disc Room Game Jam.</em></p><strong>HOW DO I PLAY?</strong><p>Press SPACE to start the game. You'll be dropped into a room. Move around using the Numpad keys (1 to 9). Numpad 5 waits a turn.</p><p><strong>Collect the Orbs!</strong> Each Orb earns you 1 point... <em>but they also spawn a deadly Disc!</em></p><p>The Discs may move around and bounce on walls. <em>Pay attention to their direction arrows;</em> they'll tell you where the Discs are moving to next! You can move into a tile currently occupied by a Disc... <em>unless the Disc is heading right toward you!</em> Be careful! Take your time to look around!</p><p>Currently the game only has one level and no real goal other than collecting as many Orbs as you can. I'm seriously considering improving this game in the future with more levels and maybe proper goals. <em>We'll see!</em> Right now, this little thing is good enough for me.</p>NEAT! ANYTHING ELSE?<p>Not really... er... <em>Take a look at my Patreon, maybe?</em> I'm working on a weekly webcomic, plus every now and then I come up with these little game ideas.</p><p>One way or another, <em><strong>thanks for checking my little Game Jam project!</strong></em> Leave a comment! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba551fc533b9625fcb9e6091373b7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Megawacky Max"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
