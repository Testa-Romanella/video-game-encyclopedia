Today, that freedom is now synonymous to <strong>pleasure</strong>. Such is the law of society. Linda, a beautiful reporter, lives a life without too much of a worry. However as time passes, a feeling of emptiness builds up inside of her as she follows the journey of a small team of <strong>soldiers</strong>. Slowly, Linda will learn the truth about this world and the fake peace that she has always enjoyed. She will have to accept that <strong>actions matter more</strong> than sharing posts about <strong>peace and love</strong>, and that <strong>meaningful accomplishments</strong> don't flourish from a <strong>meaningless life </strong>of entertainment.\u00a0 For Linda, her views about this society come to be questioned as the ever growing problem of <strong>crime and terrorism</strong> becomes omnipresent.\u00a0Beyond this illusory peace, war is brewing between the Empire and the Union, an ideological conflict between <strong>defending the rights of criminal</strong> and their <strong>complete eradication</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>\"There is no such thing as peace as long as there are criminals.\"</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFO</strong></p>\n<ol><li>The story is set in the same world as my first visual novel, but it is not required to read the first story to understand this one.
