Here is a link t the game engine.\u00a0</strong>https://github.com/Rigidity/RigidEngine</p>\n<p>The goal of this game is to survive as long as possible! Avoid viruses at all costs. If you run in to them, you start to lose your health and speed up. You can click on any virus to destroy it, but if you do the game gets more difficult! As well as this, you can collect shields, which make the game harder while at the same time clearing out large groups of viruses. Comment your high score down below!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T08:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b1/1b10fae43818dcd989426503752d196f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rigidity"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
