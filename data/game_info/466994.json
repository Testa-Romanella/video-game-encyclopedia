Direct control over horizontal movement is replaced by a \"gear\" system that offers a choice/tradeoff between acceleration and max speed.</p>\n<p>Created by Blake Hall and Connor Shipway.</p>\n<p>Sound effects generated with Tom Vian's ChipTone.<br/>https://sfbgames.com/chiptone/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:47:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298d65c52b2a3c79b6777fb056680ad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cshipway"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
