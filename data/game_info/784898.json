The hand-drawn arrows will guide you through the scenes while the text buttons guide you through each conversation.</strong></p>\n<p>I imagine this as a both a conversation between friends and a conversation one can have with one's self.\u00a0 Part of this is a reflection on my own life, a memoir of sorts, and part is reflection on time and nature. While a bit of an abstract representation of a personal story, I hope you can follow the thread, find the meanings, and relate in your own way.\u00a0</p><p>This is not a fully linear experience and does not have to be played in the exact order shown in the video.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the art was made by me and the music is from Pixabay. This story was made using Ink and Unity.\u00a0 Art was made in the Adobe suite. The Tarot cards are styled based on\u00a0 the Rider-Waite deck art.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please share thoughts and reflections in the comments. Thanks for playing :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T14:24:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/048d9212784754313bf5fc081b578edf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Claire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
