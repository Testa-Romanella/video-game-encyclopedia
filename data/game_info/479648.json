{"id": 479648, "slug": "you-love-him", "name": "You Love Him", "name_original": "You Love Him", "description": "<p>\u201cYou Love Him\u201d is told from the perspective of someone in an abusive relationship. It\u2019s a fictionalization of what it\u2019s like to be dating someone who seems perfect at first, but they slowly start to show their true colors. I wanted to illustrate the cycle of abuse - blaming oneself, thinking that person will go back to being the perfect partner they were at the beginning, all while you start to doubt yourself and lose your identity. But you stay because \u201cyou love him\u201d.</p>\n<p>I hope that this game can show those who have gone through\u00a0something similar that they aren't alone in their experiences, and that it can also\u00a0help others understand why it can be so hard to leave an abusive relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Warning</strong>: This game can be unpleasant depending on the choices you make and has the potential of a \u201cbad ending\u201d. It may be triggering for those who have a history of abuse or eating disorders.
