This is an issue with parallax and we hope to fix this soon.<br/>\n</li><li>The third level (Above Boardwalk) is not finished yet, so assets have not been placed.</li><li>The forth level (Under Boardwalk) does not have textures for grapplable surfaces yet.\u00a0</li><li>Slopes can be a bit of an issue. There is no ETA on this currently.</li><li>The animation for swinging is implemented but not yet finished.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:43:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/414/41400d1691d7000c66fa33de9adafc44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aw3s0m3saus3"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
