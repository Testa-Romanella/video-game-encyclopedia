Enjoy the frenetic melee-based combat, explore the random-generated level, get new upgrades and find your way to the next level.<br/></p>\n<p>This small demo is the result of a final degree project where I worked as game designer and programmer. The project is cancelled and would not go any further. However, it is still possible for me to be updating it in the future, fixing some bugs and adding music and sound effects.</p>\n<p>You can find much more info in my webpage:<br/>https://sergiolucasserrano.wixsite.com/website/krono-crashers</p>\n<p>Feel free to play it and let me know your thoughts!<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\nWASDMovementMouse left clickAttack<br/>Mouses right clickDashSpace BarSpecial Ability", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-28T03:46:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0be6423d6cb5897b99715afb17833b9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lucas Serrano"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
