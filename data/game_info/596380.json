One was responsible for Art, another took care of Level Design, the third was in charge of testing and QA, and the fourth was the producer, keeping everyone working. I was the primary programmer of the team, I coded most of the gameplay feature on each level and some in between the levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What is this Project:<br/>The\u00a0initial\u00a0idea\u00a0of the game\u00a0was to combine the world of\u00a0The\u00a0Mandalorian\u00a0with the gameplay style of\u00a0Super Mario Bros,\u00a0making it\u00a0a\u00a0fast-paced\u00a0side scrolling\u00a02D\u00a0platform\u00a0shooter that encourages exploration.\u00a0With our game,\u00a0I\u00a0Went to Space and Somebody\u00a0Stole my Baby, the player plays as a Mandalorian that\u00a0fights\u00a0through various enemies\u00a0in search of their stolen child\u00a0across multiple planets.\u00a0The idea was to have each level as a planet\u00a0played in the side scroller view\u00a0and the space flight\u00a0as a\u00a0top-down\u00a0perspective game mode.\u00a0The space flight\u00a0game mode was scrapped\u00a0for the\u00a0betterment of the planet levels.\u00a0The planet levels are all unique,\u00a0on the visual side\u00a0they have their own landscapes, enemies and\u00a0hazards, the scripting\u00a0of enemies and hazards in\u00a0the levels is used throughout all levels.\u00a0The\u00a0top-down feature was still included in the final game, instead of a whole game mode it served as the level select\u00a0part of the game.<br/>The mechanics of the game include the standard 2D platformer set of moves, there is running, jumping, and of course shooting.\u00a0We didn\u2019t include a double jump\u00a0feature\u00a0to\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0difficulty and encourage the player to use\u00a0other movement features available to them.\u00a0Such\u00a0features include\u00a0the ladders\u00a0and bounce pads, the bounce pads where later removed as they would give the player a big advantage.<br/>As for the\u00a0story\u00a0side of the game, the idea was to have comedy\u00a0drive the\u00a0narrative forward and to use it to pay homage to the\u00a0inspirations of the game.\u00a0The elements of comedy and art added to the game were to try have it stand out from the rest of the games in the\u00a0genre. The\u00a0key focus is combining space, exploration and\u00a0comedic storytelling to form the bases of this game.</p>\n<p>My Contribution to the Project:<br/>As the Lead Programmer\u00a0of the project,\u00a0I contributed a whole bunch of technical features, not all of them my idea but some of them\u00a0were.\u00a0I developed part of the platformer movement system,\u00a0modifying the characteristics of the character to the way we wanted them to be.\u00a0I built upon the unity standard assets player character, adding a health system and a weapon system. The health system consists\u00a0of a health bar and a life count, the\u00a0player\u00a0losses a life whenever the health bar reaches zero. The weapon system is a point and shoot system, the player points with their cursor\u00a0and whatever they want and shoot, the weapon is on a pivot and has\u00a0a full\u00a0360 degrees of rotation.\u00a0I also developed\u00a0most of\u00a0the prefabs or objects found in the game. I would take the art from the Art lead and implement it however it was required. I created the\u00a0building blocks of the levels,\u00a0this includes ground objects, platforms and ladders for the player to use.\u00a0I\u00a0coded the health pickups and hazards found in\u00a0each level of\u00a0the game, each with their own level appropriate sprite style.\u00a0I also coded the enemy systems of the game,\u00a0these are\u00a0their movement\u00a0ability,\u00a0shooting\u00a0function\u00a0and their ways of\u00a0damaging\u00a0the player.</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:10:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d0/0d008bd663418dfd668c264bfb5ca597.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Fernandes Marcos"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
