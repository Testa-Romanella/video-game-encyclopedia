The game progresses by completion of puzzles and collection of items, as there is no fighting system. I would estimate about 45 minutes of playtime. (it's fairly short.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Art: I\u00a0drew the title screen artwork, cutscene artwork, face graphic for the unknown agent, the ember skyline, and designed (but didn't draw) both the agent and the reaper. Please do not use my art at all,\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Audio: I\u00a0used the defaults, but I\u00a0got a somewhat unique sound by slowing all of them down to make them feel like more of what I\u00a0was going for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Story: I\u00a0put a lot of effort into this aspect of the game, please do not steal or take inspiration from any ideas presented in my game.</p>\n<p>I plan to combine all of the parts of Darktown\u00a0into one game someday.</p>\n<p>Made in RPG maker MV.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:14:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a9/4a97a8e7b0b36c6dd484b054e0be229d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hiro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
