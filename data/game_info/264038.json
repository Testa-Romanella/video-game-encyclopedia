See how long you last against a relentless enemy that launches satellites designed to take you out at a faster and faster pace!<br/><br/>Plays great natively on both iPhone and iPad!<br/><br/>You are one of a group of elite satellite operators tasked with controlling one of your country's few remaining surveillance satellites observing the enemy. In order to maintain surveillance, the satellite must be kept as close as possible to its optimal orbit. Watch out though, the enemy constantly sends killer satellites intended to destroy your surveillance satellite. You must avoid these or destroy them with your onboard laser. The longer you last, the faster they come!<br/><br/>As you thrust to maneuver, you use up fuel and as you fire your laser, you run down its battery. Luckily, orbiting fuel depots can replenish your satellite if you get close enough to them. Manage your resources to maximize your points.<br/><br/>Real orbital mechanics and control algorithms govern the motion and abilities of both your satellite and the enemy satellites. Make sure you don't stray too far from your optimal orbit. The closer you stay, the faster your points accumulate and if you get out of control, it's game over!<br/><br/>Controls:<br/><br/>Three different thrust control modes: tilt-to-thrust, thumb sliders, or directional touch.<br/>Two different laser fire control modes: joystick plus button, or joystick alone.<br/><br/>Try it!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:01:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/482/482982a8714c514a792be620b570afe5.jpg", "website": "http://www.psatellite.com/iphone/iphone.php#SpaceDefense", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Princeton Satellite Systems"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Princeton Satellite Systems"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
