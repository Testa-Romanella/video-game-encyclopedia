He lived in a bag of marshmallows with all his friends. They were all the same size and shape, and they were all happy together.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, Marsh found himself falling out of the bag and into a strange machine. He soon realized that he had fallen into a Gravitron. The machine was filled with different chambers and tunnels that used the mechanics of gravity to move things around.\r\n\r\nMarsh was scared and alone, but he knew he had to find a way to escape the Gravitron and reunite with his marshmallow friends. He started to navigate through the chambers, using the pull of gravity to move him forward.\r\n\r\nNavigate Marsh through the deadliest of mazes and platforms by using gravity to help him get out of the Gravitron to reunite with friends!..\r\n\r\nControls-\r\n1-Arrow keys/ WASD to move\r\n\u00a02-Space to jump\u00a0\r\n3-Touch the portal to get to the next level\r\n\u00a04-Avoid spikes/ acid\r\nCredits\r\n<ol><li>Thanks to FinesseArt for making the art for this project.</li><li>Coding by Metroid Games</li><li>YouTube for the Victory Music</li><li>This game is a recreation of the popular online game, That Gravity Game.
