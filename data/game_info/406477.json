This is a small game i ' ve been creating in my spare time.</p>\n<p>its very simillar to an endless runner although i plan to make levels with increasing difficulty. The character must dash left and right to avoid the various obstacles while collecting apples (coins).</p>\n<p>the current very early state of the game only features 1 level and the main menu. Future builds of the game will include more characters and diffrent levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>intstructions :\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swipe Left and right to avoid obstacles. Move close to the warning signs to avoid incoming trucks.</p>\n<p>i hope you can get a few minutes worth of fun out of this any kind of feedback would be appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d66/d6638960a4ccb30e0b15811fdf8c4d8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Liakos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
