In the game the player will play the role of the character Oneirina to explore through dream world, help the owner of the dream to get rid of the suffering.</p>\n<p>The idea of creating this game came from the character I created 4 years ago. I wanted to try to present the world she was in through the game. With limited time and technology, this is all I can do for now. I was torn for a while in choosing whether to make 2d or 3d. But in order to better present my character, I chose to make a 2D game. During the creation of the game, I got inspiration from Crystar, Hollow Knight.</p>\r\nSome settings:\r\n<p><strong>Oneirina</strong>\u2014\u2014The protagonist of this game, she is from the original character I created 4 years ago.
