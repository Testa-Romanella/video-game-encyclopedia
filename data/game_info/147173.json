You might either be our saviour or lead all of us to our doom... We are already lacking time so listen carefully. Your cargo contains seeds you will have to plant and harvest in order to get enough food to provide for our people at the end of your journey. Watch your men so they don't eat all of your crops and be careful... You can choose your friends but not the other planets of your solar system ! We don't know what you should be expecting for once you will have landed. So be quick and don't forget to keep a close look at your resources !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a04/a04dfd90b14041192010b1d2f6a9e49b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anadidathorion"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
