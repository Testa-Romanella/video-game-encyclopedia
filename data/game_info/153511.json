Made in 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p>In Npigs your goal is to get all of your pigs as high as possible. \r\nThe catch is that the higher you climb, the more pigs you have to move \r\naround and prevent from falling. Your score is equal to the number of \r\npigs multiplied by the height of the lowest pig. So, if you drop to the \r\nground your score drops to 0!</p>\n<p>(Okay and by pigs I mean those things that look certainly nothing like pigs)</p>\n<p><strong>Rate Npigs on LDJAM!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb5/cb5f389eb723cbb23feb2d5e1008e130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Artful Diversions"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
