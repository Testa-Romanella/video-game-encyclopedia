So I dumped this out working after work, for maybe 20 hours. That being said the deadline quickly approached. I worked my best to implement a bug free, entertaining game play loop, and spent a solid 4 hours on balancing. I believe I ended up with a fun and repayable prototype! However art did suffer, so did proper menus. <br/></p>\n<p>Somethings I was really hoping to get around to but I didn't:<br/></p>\n<p>- animations</p>\n<p>- more enemy types, including a ranged enemy</p>\n<p>- more cards, including things like walls/traps/spells (slow enemies, freeze, etc.)</p>\n<p>- better UI</p>\n<p>- an animated intro</p>\n<p>- settings menu</p>\n<p>- even more balancing! <br/></p>\n\n<p>Sadly that's just what I was expecting to be able to do, I had so many more ideas too. If people find it fun, maybe I can find an artist to team up with and keep working on it. That's all!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story:</strong></p>\n<p>You are an angel, who, er.. well, got bored.\u00a0 So to cure your boredom you decided to reign terror on the earth. Now an endless hoard of humanities best warriors have come to stop you. How long will you survive.</p>\n<p>How to play: <br/>Defeat enemies and collect cards they drop. Use those cards to increase stats/heal. Be careful when using a card though!\u00a0 If you miss your player, you will not get the benefit.\u00a0 If an enemy is inside the target area, they will also get the benefit.Enemies come in waves, each wave there are more enemies, and they get stronger. After the last enemy from that wave spawns you have 10 seconds before the next wave starts . Each wave (up to a certain point) will cause enemies to spawn faster. That's it!<br/></p>\n<p>(Numbers for nerds below)<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Fullscreen: F (Recommended, not required) <br/>Movement: WSAD</p>\n<p>Fire: hold left click</p>\n<p>Select/Use card: right click</p>\n<p>Deselect Card: middle mouse Click<br/></p>\n<p>Continue on menus: space</p>\n<p>Debug Controls:</p>\n<p>Left this in for fun so enjoy. <br/>It will make the game never end, and max fire rate.</p>\n<p>Also it will draw collision boxes if you care about that.</p>\n<p>Toggle Debug: Numpad Plus</p>\n<p>Toggle Draw World Grid: Numpad-</p>\n<p>Move Camera up: Up Arrow</p>\n<p>Move Camera down: Down Arrow</p>\n<p>Move Camera left: Left Arrow</p>\n<p>Move Camera right: Right Arrow</p>\n<p>Zoom Camera In: Numpad 1</p>\n<p>Zoom Camera Out: Numpad 0</p>\n<p>Reset Camera: Numpad Enter</p>\n<p>Log Camera Position: Numpad Dot</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits: </strong><br/>Almost everything was created by me besides a few sounds.</p>\n<p>Game Over Sound: Sudocolon (https://opengameart.org/content/icy-game-over)</p>\n<p>Enemy Hit Sound: Independent.nu (https://opengameart.org/content/37-hitspunches)</p>\n<p>Player Hit Sound: n3b (https://opengameart.org/content/grunt)</p>\n<p>(Shameless plug) Song (by me) \u00a0https://open.spotify.com/track/2KAi7SrogIJKKxSnyMgT0O?si=07d6ab05b57942cb<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Numbers for nerds: (ill finish filling this out when I have more time)<br/></p>\n<p>Enemy spawn rate: 1 every 2 seconds - (current wave - 1) * 0.11 seconds;</p>\n<p>Enemy Count: 5 + 5 * current wave - 1</p>\n<p>Card drop rate: 40%</p>\n<p>Enemy base stats: <br/>- Health:</p>\n<p>- Move Speed: <br/>- Attack: <br/>Lines of Code: ~3,500</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc8d824784f649c967795d61c0213913.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MBektic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
