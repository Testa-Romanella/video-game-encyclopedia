To do that, you have to manage your industry and invest enough money for its construction. Select tiles and build machines. Every 4 months the train comes, and you can buy new material and sell your products. Some products are sold for higher value. Each machine makes different products. There are events that might appear each month. Be aware of them, they might come in handy, but they could also screw you. Watch out your worker's happiness.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Assets External:</p>\n<p>Icons in game, all from\u00a0Flaticon.com.
