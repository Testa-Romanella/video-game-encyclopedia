It reads the user mouse clicks and mouse location. It creates 3D primitives from user right click and destroys 3D primitives after set time or by the user left click. I built a user interface to give the user abilities to change shapes on spawned 3D primitives. The parameters that the user can change are the type of 3D primitive, color range, and if the user would like timed destroy or destroy all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T04:58:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1eb1f66122b5b0b7ea212116787b58d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jonnathan Rodriguez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
