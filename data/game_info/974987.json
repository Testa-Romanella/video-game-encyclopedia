It's a dead world, but ironically, it's all the more fascinating for it. A vivid landscape awaits you to explore.<h3>Keep your passengers happy</h3><br/>The passengers on your train will work diligently at your command, but be careful: if you don't manage their happiness properly, they might throw you off the train.<h3>Build your own train with card decks</h3><br/>Each time you pass through a city, you'll be able to add new train cars by launching a heavy lift drone. Be careful with each choice you make. If you are lucky, you'll be able to build a better, more synergized, happily-ever-after train deck, but it won't always go as you planned.<h3>Reach the Promised Land</h3><br/>Lead your passengers in search of the Promised Land, somewhere on the eastern edge of the world. But the journey to the Promised Land isn't all smooth and pleasant. You'll have to pass through toxic areas, and a severe storm is brewing behind you. Pay attention to your passengers' happiness levels and lead them safely to the Promised Land. The journey is in your hands.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T21:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac0/ac0552db380a6fc780d3058ff4ead1ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["STEWDIO"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jungle Game Lab"], "esrb_rating": null}
