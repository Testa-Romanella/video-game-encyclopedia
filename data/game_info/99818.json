NOTE THAT THOSE POWERS AREN'T PARTICULARLY BALANCED JUST YET.</p><p>My long term goals are to add a few modes including a story mode with a level progression, bosses, new enemies, and a multiplayer VS mode.</p><p>This game was originally designed during the /agdg/ Winter Jam 2015.</p><p>BGM: \"Cephalopod\" by Kevin Macleod<br/>Art and Sound Effects by me.
