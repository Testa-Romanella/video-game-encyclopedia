But now you have a time machine and soon, soon they will ALL PAY.</p>\n<p>A humourous science fiction visual novel about the importance of friendship, free will, and the space time continuum. Three endings as well as several bad timelines you have the chance to fix with time travel, all of which are laid out in the included walkthrough.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note that this is a very short game, with maybe an hour of gameplay, and I'm entirely happy for people to play it for free. But if you decide to give me some money for it I certainly won't complain ;) </p>\n<p>Feedback welcome! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b3b6035185e146efe7cc73dcea3c15d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Spiral Atlas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
