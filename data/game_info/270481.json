Wrapped up in the sudden wake of an unprovoked attack on the city, you must make choices that determine your fate and the fate of those around you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What will you learn? Who knows. Will you punch an angel? Probably!</p>\n<p>(This demo is not for the faint of heart, as it was intentionally designed to deal with uncomfortable themes and set the tone for bonds of friendship and more under fire.)</p>\n<p>Note: The majority of the art (pretty much everything with the exception of Konrad's sprite) is filler art that I've placed in until the artist I'm working with has time to finish everything. Please be patient as the visual quality of the game improves and try to play for story content.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b7532074e7371fc19b37c12945117226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Wolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
