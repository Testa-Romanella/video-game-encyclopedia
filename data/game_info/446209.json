Gladly, scientists have found a way to break the laws of physics in order to move the planet out of its orbit !<br/>If this is not enough to survive this apocalypse, the moon can also be used as a weapon, allowing to collect asteroid dust. The dust is then used by the scientists to modify the structure of the planet and its moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>You move using ZQSD, WASD, the arrows or a game controller. You control the planet earth and your goal is to destroy the asteroids coming using the moon. During the game, enemies are improved and you select if you want to increase Harder, Better, Faster or Stronger components. The planet is also improved by collecting asteroid dust spawning when asteroids are destroyed.<br/>Additional controls : P or Escape to pause game, Space to restart when dead and to return to menu if you won.<br/><br/><em>All sounds, musics, assets and logic were made during those 101 hours.<br/>Tools used: Unreal Engine 4, GIMP2, SFXR, BoscaCeoil, Audacity<br/><br/>Feel free to ask any asset or even the Unreal Engine project. But I will not take any\u00a0responsibility\u00a0if you don't find what you want: I made a mess in the blueprints on the last hours of the jam\u00a0!</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d8/5d8c4b7511a76e3d46a51dd1c831399e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Akromha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
