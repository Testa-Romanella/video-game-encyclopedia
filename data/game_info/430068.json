La Nuit en Marche</em></strong> is a project that explores the violence experienced by generations of students in the student district of the capital of France. This release is a prototype / demo. \r\n  </p>\n<p>This is a prototype realised for the #HPS1Jam.

During this jam I worked mainly on the scripts, the interactions, the pacing of the game, the textures and the pixelated filter.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The project started as a student project, where I mainly worked with Probuilder and Unity\u2019s FPS controller to create the game space.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Made with Unity using Unity\u2019s FPS controller, probuilder and progrid.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I used the movie <em>\u201cCensier en gr\u00e8ve -1986\u201d</em> made by the film studies students from Paris 3 (https://academia.hypotheses.org/8840) and the music video for Kate Bush\u2019s <em>\u201cSat in Your Lap\u201d</em> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4csr6pLZLg).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Textures from texture.com.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:07:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/716/716e323abc502e0ca74b584e2e152aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexandre_VS"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
