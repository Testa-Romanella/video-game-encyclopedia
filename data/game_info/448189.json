{"id": 448189, "slug": "chicken-runner", "name": "Chicken Runner", "name_original": "Chicken Runner", "description": "<p>In Chicken Runner, you play as Nathan the chicken. You can customize him with different skins, that can be bought in the shop. Coins are earned when you complete a level. The amount of coins you get is the number of times you've played the level subtracted from the level you're on. 1 is the minimum amount of coins you can get. Use the joystick to move, and the jump button to jump. In most levels, there will be a hawk chasing you. If you touch it, the game ends, and you can quit to the main menu, or retry. The hawk's name is Kamryn, in case you're wondering (don't ask).\u00a0 The levels are not always the same. You find new places in different levels. You will find new characters along the way, too. If you get bored, don't worry. More levels will be added in new updates, and an infinite mode may be coming soon. Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T03:50:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3431dbe1e27ee1ff6ac1b8396a8619.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MihirTheCoder"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
