Fill shelves and try to keep them at 100% at all times, if they reach 0% you won't be able to refill the shelves anymore.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>Take boxes from the storage room (<strong>walk into\u00a0 the yellow zone right behind you in the storage room to access the menu</strong>)\u00a0filled with everyday stuff from the grocery shop and take them to their designated aisles, then fill the dark-gray colored\u00a0shelves.\u00a0 Filling the shelves takes 4 seconds so make sure you are as fast as you can be. If you happened to choose the wrong box from the storage room shelves, you can always just replace them (<strong>by throwing them into the white trash bin in the storage room</strong>)!<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D - Move<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Shift - Run</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LMB - Interact with UI</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You can quit the game by walking into the door on the right wall.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br/><br/><br/>Known Bugs</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If the shelf reaches 0% while you're refilling it your character won't be able to move, in this case ALT+F4 out of the game.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T19:28:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee2/ee23e05c5c249683cb1e36be53c7707b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Am0sS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
