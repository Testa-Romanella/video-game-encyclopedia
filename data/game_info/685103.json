ThriveFantasy offers contests in NFL, NBA,<br/>and MLB. Our contests are broken down into two contest types.<br/><br/>Traditional: <br/>Select a player\u2019s individual stat-line or a combination of stat-lines to win a predetermined amount of fantasy points.<br/><br/>Versus:<br/>Select which of two players will perform better in the pre-selected stat category. The player less likely to win will earn more fantasy points.<br/><br/>From there, the contests are broken down in the lobby by how many other opponents you\u2019ll be<br/>playing against.<br/><br/>\u2022 Featured \u2013 These contests have the \u201cstar\u201d logo. They have the biggest prize pools and the<br/>largest payouts.<br/>\u2022 Tournaments/Leagues \u2013 Small &amp; large field contests with huge prizes.<br/>\u2022 Head to Head \u2013 Face-off against one opponent; winner takes all.<br/><br/>Selecting Your Picks:<br/>Every contest will give you the opportunity to pick certain props from a predetermined list. Each unique prop has an \u201cOver\u201d and \u201cUnder\u201d point value assigned to it and you will be rewarded that point value if that prop is correct. The higher the point value, the less probable it is to occur.<br/><br/>Your team is made up of 15 picks that you select out of an available list of 20. You\u2019ll also select<br/>two In-Case-of-Emergency (ICE) picks. An ICE pick will automatically be added to your team only if an athlete is ruled out of a game prior to their start time. You will be notified if an ICE pick is being used.<br/><br/>Check Results:<br/>If you\u2019ve placed in a paying position, the amount you\u2019ve won, as determined by the prize structure of the contest, will be credited to your ThriveFantasy account.<br/><br/>You can use your winnings to play more contests, try other sports, or withdraw the amount to your PayPal account", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T05:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de49f9c2ce16d112dc164711bb9b3a3.jpg", "website": "http://www.thrivefantasy.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Props2Fantasy.com"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Props2Fantasy.com"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
