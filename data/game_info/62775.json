Frequent updates will continue to expand the depth and content of the game world.<br/><br/>Ship EvolutionsMods &amp; Gear can be unlocked, upgraded and combined to make unexpected and powerful combinations:Example Build #1: Seeking Cluster Grenade<strong>Grenade + Body: Assault + High Explosive + Splinter Shot + Heat Seeking + Charged Shot</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>This build focuses on creating as many grenade splinters as possible using the <strong>Grenade</strong> weapon and sends them tearing toward targets using the <strong>Heat Seeking</strong> mod. The overlapping blasts from the initial explosion add up to a huge amount of damage at the epicenter, while the seeking clusters handle crowd control.<br/><br/>Example Build #2: Celestial Shield-Bomber<strong>Hullbreaker + Amp Shield + Volatile Shields + Flash Shielding + Emergency Systems + Celestial Lance</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>This build takes advantage of the <strong>Hullbreaker's</strong> speed and resilience to crash damage to slam directly into enemies. The fragile <strong>Amp Shield</strong> is used not for defense, but to augment Hullbreaker's strongest aspects, gaining increased speed and force. The shield will break on impact, but we can capitalize on that using the <strong>Volatile Shields</strong> mod, which detonates the shield when it goes down, blasting all nearby enemies. <strong>Flash Shielding</strong> gets it running again quickly while <strong>Emergency Systems</strong> grant a moment of damage immunity, making charge attacks safer. Finally, <strong>Celestial Lance</strong> is used to deal burning damage to everything around the ship at high velocities!<br/><br/><br/>Nova Drift is developed by Jeffrey Nielson of <strong>Chimeric</strong>, a 1-man development team, featuring music and audio by Miles Tilmann of <strong>Pixeljam</strong>.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-18T18:25:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03aa7cfa7201e6bf41036123ce69be93.jpg", "website": "http://www.novadrift.io", "rating": 4.04, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 280, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 8, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 25, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 27, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixeljam", "Chimeric"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixeljam"], "esrb_rating": null}
