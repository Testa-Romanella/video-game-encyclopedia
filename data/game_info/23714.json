This first release of a small corner of our city is a glimpse at what\u2019s to come. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe pioneering citizens of Hypatia will find incredible activities that will entertain them for hours on end. We invite everyone to play with our painting tools in environments where fun is let loose. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s all in a shared space where visitors can talk with one another and explore everything from the fantastic to the impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur museum will take you through the looking glass where art may not be what it seems at first glance; we invite you to step right in. Next, visit our interactive theater where you can put yourself on the stage in a vaudeville style production of your making. Don\u2019t feel like being an actor? Maybe you\u2019d like some puzzle solving in our Cogwheel Garden where not only might you learn something about gears, but you might just reach the top of the tower to take off in a sky boat.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBoats! We\u2019ve got that covered too over at our Waterfront. Get ready for a workout should you feel up to the task. We guarantee you\u2019ll be huffing and puffing to win this race. There are hidden places to explore too, but if we told you what they were and what you\u2019d be doing we\u2019d spoil the surprise. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpeaking of surprises, who\u2019s not awed by the delight of watching fireworks on a summer night? Visit Kapow Lake to fire off all kinds of fireworks. Along the way you can learn something about the chemistry of these beautiful bursts of color in the night sky as you build your own virtual fireworks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStep into Paintville, the first multi-dimensional virtual coloring book. You\u2019ll have an entire neighborhood to paint everything from the sky to your friends. Chaos will run riot as buckets of paint and graffiti color this corner of the world in a palette shaken right out of the rainbow. The only thing missing is unicorns. Nope, we\u2019ve got them too\u2026.and cats. Need pictures of cats and unicorns? There are currently four types of virtual cameras to take and share pictures with. From the original 1865 Daguerreotype camera to a Polaroid or the first digital camera, the Dycam.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBest of all, this entire experience is growing into a massive collaborative social space where the citizens of Hypatia are the actors and the story in this evolving new city of the future is happening right before your eyes. So join us in Hypatia where creativity is the currency and you are on center stage in a new world of Virtual Reality.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:12:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dc/1dcb209d9338db2439f4fccdfc6de233.jpg", "website": "http://www.timefirevr.com/hypatia", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 111, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TimefireVR"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["TimefireVR"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
