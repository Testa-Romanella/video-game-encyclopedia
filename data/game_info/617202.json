I had a bad time crunch and missed a jump that wasn't possible. My sincerest apologies.\r\nA possible version can be found here\r\nThe zooming limits are also broken, but this doesn't completely break the game at least.<br/>The game also does not have a winning screen, and either crashes or closes.<br/>Audio is a bit buggy and cut off when playing on the WebGL version. Try the Executable version to fix this.\r\nReally bad time crunch sorry ;(\r\nHow to play:\r\n<p>You need to link computers and beacons together and make your way to the Exit. To turn on a computer you must use a Chip, which will then broadcast a signal to nearby beacons.\u00a0<br/>But watch out! Jammers block signals and prevent technology within its range from working. This can be used as an advantage or disadvantage.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\nMovementWASD/Arrow KeysJumpSpaceInteractEZoom +/- ()*Scroll wheel in/outRespawnRExit to MenuEscape", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3d84c1820ce315626ee90e5f372fcaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Plokie"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
