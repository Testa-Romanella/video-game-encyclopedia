No armored bikinis or spiked pauldrons here!<br/></li><li>By surviving battles, your squads gain experience and develop their skills. Fresh recruits have nothing on a seasoned veteran.<br/></li><li>Generals are the linchpin of a squad, and their skills and abilities can drastically change the outcome of a battle. Each general has a unique personality generated at the beginning of each game. Each has their own appearance, character traits, and abilities. It's impossible to predict who will appear the next go \u2018round: a brave but simple knight, a talented but greedy tactical genius, or a bloodthirsty barbarian who instills fear in friend and foe alike.<br/></li><li>A pantheon of chosen generals: put your greatest leaders here to re-use them from campaign to campaign, or hire legendary figures feared and revered throughout history, such as Joan of Arc and Genghis Khan.<br/></li><li>The numerous scenarios offer a huge variety of different challenges: win a civil war, fight off nomads, deal with pirates raiding the coast, save a kingdom ravaged by plague, or crush a peasant uprising.<br/></li><li>Battle formations: effective positioning of your troops is half the battle. Tactical tricks, feints, and ambushes are at your disposal. Win your battles through quality, not quantity.<br/></li><li>Terrain and weather: even the perfect army may lose in unfavorable conditions. It\u2019s generally a good idea to lure enemy cavalry into a bog, under your arrows \u2013 but remember that rain and fog make your archers useless.<br/></li><li>Upgrade your soldiers\u2019 weapons and armor at the royal forge.</li></ul><br/>Dark Ages is a turn-based strategy game set in the violent world of an alternate Middle Ages. Vikings against war elephants, musketeers against the Mongol cavalry, ancient phalanx legions against crusaders; the deadliest armies in history clashing in bloody war.<br/> An army without leadership is merely a mob. In Dark Ages, troops follow the lead of their commanders: unique leaders with their own virtues, vices, talents, and weaknesses.<br/> Take the throne of a small kingdom being torn apart by feuds and threatened by militant neighbors, and try to survive the Dark Ages.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T12:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d021bc1e1acdcf983561bcf5f3450390.jpg", "website": "http://www.herocraft.com/", "rating": 2.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 139, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 56, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["HeroCraft"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["HeroCraft"], "esrb_rating": null}
