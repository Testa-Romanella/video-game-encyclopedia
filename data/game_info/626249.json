Therefore, the left mouse button must be pressed (charge) and released (throw). Additionally, a stone can be thrown to shoot items from high places and to demonstrate the physics. There are healing items and mana items placed in the game which can be collected. The player also has the ability to cast passive spells (healing and light) by using the keyboard (Q/E). If the healing spell (yellow magic ball) is equipped, the player can heal himself/herself by pressing the right mouse button. To complete the game all the monsters must be defeated.</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n<ul>\n<li>Joshua Oblong</li>\n<li>Mathias Schwengerer</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T06:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb8/eb86284df87c8fec64bc28910ca72d15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mathias Schwengerer"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
