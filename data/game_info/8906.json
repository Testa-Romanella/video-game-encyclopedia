Guide him by playing with gravity and beat more than 70 mind-teasing levels by collecting cool disguises. Because somehow, each new disguise will bring Fall one step closer to winning her love. <br/><br/>By rotating the device or finger-swiping, gather the costumes artfully placed in each level and try to collect as many hearts as you can. To make things a bit more challenging, different kinds of colored blocks will have to be taken into account, sometimes making your task easier and other times more complicated. And of course, there are fearsome enemies and traps to be avoided!<br/><br/>Fall is a tiny block guy. One day as he wanders the streets, he meets Kaisa. It is love at first sight. Unfortunately for him, Kaisa only seems to have eyes for a poster of a man with a mustache. No problem! If having mustache is what it takes to secure his new sweetheart\u2019s attention, Fall will find a mustache. But the thing is, Kaisa\u2019s desire is fickle, to say the least.
