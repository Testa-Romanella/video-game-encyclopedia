The quests are item-based, and in each you must collect a different set of soul fragments. The game includes several interesting mechanics like vine-swinging and hidden caves.</p>\n<p>Controls are configurable via the menu.</p>\n<p>Important tips:</p>\n<p>When reaching the alter, drop all the items onto it by double clicking each one in your inventory.</p>\n<p>Dash can be used when on the ground, in the water, or on a vine. Can be used once afterward in the air, allowing for double dashing. This is needed for some far jumps.</p>\n<p>To vine swing,\u00a0hold down jump while moving in front of a vine, and you will catch it. Use left and right arrows to swing the vine, and let go with jump\u00a0when the vine is moving quickly to get more height (player jump height off a vine is proportional to vine velocity)</p>\n<p>You can't see into caves until you are in them, so if you can't find a fragment it's probably in a cave.</p>\n<p>If you are stuck, in the quest book is a hint button that describes the location of the next fragment in the quest.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T04:33:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a57/a57fa17683a9e078a1ff72b77bd50178.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Footkick72"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
