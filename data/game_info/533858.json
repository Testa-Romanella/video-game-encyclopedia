The farther away you from the character you\u00a0click the more force the push will have.

I don't know why. Works in other broswers though!</p>\n<p>FEEDBACK QUESTIONS: Is the game too hard? Are the push mechanics more annoying than challenging? Or is it totally fine and it's actually too easy? What is the truth?</p>\n<p>THINGS I PLAN\u00a0TO ADD:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sound</li><li>Custom buttons</li><li>More levels</li><li>Some power ups</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/1591f7cda7375d1e1bcfcf04dd4de5a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ana"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
