Will you find help and get out of down, or does your destiny have something different in mind?<br/></p><p>This is a game where you can meet and date different versions of the best actor of all time, Keanu Reeves.</p>\n<p>Not enough Keanu for you? Don\u2019t worry! The next patch will contain more Keanus! If you have any recommendations, let me know and I\u2019ll do my best to accommodate them!</p>\n<p>Join my discord server to get updates on this game and the future games I work on!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/bpDKDUa<br/></p>\r\nWhat to Expect?\r\n<p>Well, this is a the very first game that I've made, and to top it all off, I made all of it in a day. This game is not perfect, but it was a good first try! So here are some things you might expect from this game!</p>\n<p>-Meet 9 different Keanus!</p>\n<p>-The 9 different endings, including a hidden true ending. Can you find the truth?</p>\n<p>-Some stupid jokes and bad editing half as a meme and half because it was rushed.</p>\n<p>-Spoilers for some of\u00a0Keanu\u2019s movies; many of these characters are based off of his films, so you may encounter some spoilers!</p>\n<p>-Some laughs. I recommend playing this game with friends or on stream so that you can get extra laughs from jokes from your friends, as I did.</p>\n<p>-Silence. I did not use any music or sounds in this game this time around. Depending on the circumstances, there may be some future updates with music, sounds, longer conversations, more choices, more endings,\u00a0\u00a0as well as more Keanus. You can leave suggestions or requests in the comments or in the discord server!</p>\n<p>-The possibility of some errors. If you encounter an error, please let me know!</p>\r\nThere's not much more to say about the game at the moment, but feel free to ask me any questions or leave comments telling me what you think!\r\nDonations are definitely not required, but are much appreciated.\u00a0\r\n<p>*This game was made with Ren'Py</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T07:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/078/078a2e35838a324980029e67da6636cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Strawbeary Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
