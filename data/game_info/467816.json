Through these growing rifts giant monsters came forth. Humans attempted to fight the Kaiju but were wiped out. Little known to the humans, the first energy waves that radiated out from the rifts alerted and transformed the previous rival marine mammals across the earth. As a new consciousness flowed through them a meeting of the mammals was formed. The first scouting mammals were sent out: otters riding dolphins found derelict cargo ships. The Otters jumping on board were searching through a section when an explosion erupted scattering a shipment of cumin across the otters. Their minds opened to the powers of the universe and by collecting this spice they were able to ingest it and form magical abilities from healing others through to sending beams of energy.<br/></p>\n<p>The rupture of the ship from the explosion scattered dahlia flowers into the ocean. The inquisitive dolphins ate them and found their already warped minds were joined by their bodies growing to a massive size and adapting to new abilities. Using this newly discovered knowledge the alliance was informed and the mammals raided human strongholds for these new resources. An alliance formed from mammals that used to eat or be eaten began an unlikely resistance against the Kaiju.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T17:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89a/89a56941e0122b7ee6dc62a3efa852e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KyojinStudios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
