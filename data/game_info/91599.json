Quote me on it see if i care.</p>\n<p><strong>stuff ppl said about the games. omfg &lt;3</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>\"Indie game developer ceMelusine makes brief, simple games that offer the player poignant moments of loneliness.</em><em>\"</em> - Leigh Alexander (Offworld)</p>\n<p><em>\"As simple as the gameplay is, every time I boot it up, I find myself hypnotized by the atmosphere and the language. There's something about Oracle that feels oddly grand and ancient.\"</em> - Danielle Riendeau (Polygon)<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"Like the declarations of Mountain, I find the symbols and prophecies pleasing to contemplate; they're little focuses for reflection.\"</em> - Alice O'Connor (Rock Paper Shotgun)</p>\n<p><em>\"The games juxtapose the arcane and the comfortable, asking you to find meaning and purpose.\" </em>- Heather Alexandra (Kotaku)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>But ceMelusine! I can't afford to pay for these games/am press!</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n\tThat's totally cool. I still want you to play the games, so feel free to email me at ceMelusine (at) gmail.com and tell me which games you are interested in playing. I'll will totally hook you up with a copy. Also maybe follow me on the tweester or something (@ceMelusine).</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>\n<p>Claris Cyarron, Brendan Vance, Emily Yakashiro, Hannah Marie, Liberty Bell, Lucas J.W.
