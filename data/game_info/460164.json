One day everything changes, when she stumbles upon an artifact from a civilization long gone. Now a mysterious pyromaniac and her goody two-shoes companion\u00a0want her dead, and she is constantly on the run.</p>\n<p>Phantom II is a text based RPG adventure game. It's focused on exploration and ATB-style turn based combat. Phantom II is the sequel to Phantom I and it takes place within the Dorsal empire. It explores the other perspective of the story and features an entirely new cast of characters. Plenty of changes have been made from the first game, though. There is an entirely reworked combat system, featuring a skill and class system, items and status effects. There are also tons of new areas to explore and monsters to fight. (Note: You do not have to have played the first game, to play this one.)</p>\n<p>NOTE: Phantom II is currently just a DEMO, meaning content is limited (granted there is already ten times the content of the first game.) Keep in mind, many of this game might change, as I update things in the future.</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<p>-An in depth ATB style combat system.</p>\n<p>-Multiple party members.</p>\n<p>-12 different classes to choose from and master.</p>\n<p>-Over 1000 individual tiles, making up large, expansive areas to explore.</p>\n<p>-Over 70 different monsters to hunt.</p>\n<p>-A crafting system with lots of craftable weapons and potions.</p>\n<p>-4 different towns with NPCs to talk to and quests to complete.</p>\n<p>-An OST with 21 different tracks.</p>\n<p>-Lots of detailed ASCII art.</p>\n<p>-A large main story to follow with plenty of twists and turns.</p>\n<p>-A save file system with auto-save.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T05:31:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b35/b35987a8612c99bb963abd75bb757c9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["S34_M0NST3R"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
