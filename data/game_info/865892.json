After 19 years, a tragedy happened where Bunny's actor at the time lost his mind and killed everybody who was present in the building that day.</p>\n<p>When police arrived at the scene, they found all the victims' bodies in Bunny suits which the killer would've retrieved from the bottom floor storage area. The building has been left abandoned since and Bunny's Friendship Hour has since been canceled.</p>\n<p>You have agreed to help a friend of yours by entering the very building the massacre occurred in and collecting <strong>40 collectable stamps</strong> left around by the killer to symbolize the death place of each victim. Each stamp could be worth up to <strong>$100,000</strong> and if you're able to get all them 40 stamps without becoming a stuffed bunny, you will get <strong>30%</strong> of the money made on each stamp sold.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<p>[WASD] Movement</p>\n<p>[Mouse] Look around</p>\n<p>[Left Shift] Sprint</p>\n<p>[F] Toggle flashlight</p>\n<p>[E] Interact</p>\n<p>[Esc] Exit to menu</p>\r\nCUSTOMIZATION:\r\n<p>Customize your killer and collect <strong>3 new skin</strong><strong>s</strong> by playing the game.</p>\n<p>The <strong>4</strong> skins currently in the game are:</p>\n<ul><li>Killer Bunny (Default)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Clean Bunny\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Dead Bunny</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Bunny (BFH)</li></ul>\n<p><em>Check back in the customization menu often to see if you've unlocked any new skins.
