Your goal is to look for a warm shelter\u00a0before you freeze to death. You will find campfires placed randomly in the map. These campfires will increase your warmth but this is not for free. You need to collect wood from trees to start the fire in the first place. Some trees let you chop them by pressing E while standing close to them. The amount of wood in each tree is randomly generated.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Explore the map, chop trees, heal at campfires, and try to find a warmer shelter\u00a0\u00a0'a special campfire with butterflies flying around' before you freeze to death.</p>\n\n<p>use WASD to move</p>\n<p>use E to interact with objects</p>\n\n\n<p>This is my first game ever so expect bugs and extreme lack of gameplay element. I may revisit this game and improve on it as I learn more about Unreal Engine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I made the game for\u00a0 Mini Jam: Warmth.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T14:11:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/1167651f8fbba2a49bb86a5f911f84bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Burnt Out Physicist"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
