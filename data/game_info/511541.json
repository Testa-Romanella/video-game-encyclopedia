Scramble by Grandstand and Astro Command by Epoch, Radio Shack and many other companies in the 80's are all the same game but in a different shell with a different name.<br/>\"If you liked the Astro Wars or Galaxy Invader conversions, you're gonna love this!\"<br/>Nominated for Game of the Week on Toucharcade.<br/>\"A must for retro game lovers!\"<br/><br/><br/> Every detail of the original tabletop classic has been faithfully emulated. All the sounds - that flickering vacuum fluorescent display, and all those waves of attacks - its all here! It is an almost perfect replica. We would say its 97% accurate. Some things have been altered slightly due to the nature of mobile devices. Our Astro Wars and Galaxy Invader retro emulations have been enjoyed well and this too has had the same treatment.
