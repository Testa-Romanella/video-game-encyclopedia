The goal of<br/>this game is to make the sequence given in each level by inputting an appropriate formula (/function)\u00a0with a limited number of characters.\u00a0 Typically, there are 5 terms given in each level (but there can be more),\u00a0and the level is completed only when all of the terms generated by the player-inputted formula match the terms given\u00a0in the level.</p>\n<p>You can use the basic arithmetic operators:\u00a0 Addition ( +\u00a0) , Subtraction\u00a0(\u00a0- )\u00a0 ,\u00a0 Multiplication\u00a0\u00a0( * ) , Division \u00a0(\u00a0/ )\u00a0, Exponentiation (^)\u00a0, along with the variable <em>n</em>\u00a0to make the formula, and later on,\u00a0 Floor Division ( // )\u00a0 and Factorial\u00a0 ( n! ) will also be unlocked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nSTRATEGY\r\n<p>You may find some patterns by finding the difference and ratio between two successive terms, or by checking if there are recurrence relations for two successive terms. You may also recognize some famous sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence and the sequence of triangular numbers.\u00a0There's not a lot more to say about strategies, as it is mostly trial and error.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\nLevels\r\n<p>Numbers\u00a0 =\u00a0 type the corresponding\u00a0numbers</p>\n<p>+ - * / ^\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0type the corresponding\u00a0operators</p>\n<p>//\u00a0 =\u00a0 type floor division (to be unlocked)</p>\n<p>!\u00a0 =\u00a0 factorial (to be unlocked)</p>\n<p>N\u00a0 =\u00a0 variable</p>\n<p>ENTER\u00a0 =\u00a0 check if the formula is correct</p>\n<p>BACKSPACE\u00a0 =\u00a0 delete a character</p>\n<p>R\u00a0 =\u00a0 clear the input</p>\n<p>SPACE\u00a0 =\u00a0 next level</p>\n<p>ESC\u00a0 =\u00a0 return to main menu</p>\n<p>LEFT / RIGHT\u00a0 =\u00a0 move text cursor to the left / right</p>\n<p>,\u00a0 /\u00a0 .\u00a0 =\u00a0 move text cursor all the way to the left / right</p>\r\nMain menu\r\n<p>SPACE\u00a0 =\u00a0 start game</p>\n<p>S\u00a0 =\u00a0 level select</p>\n<p>H\u00a0 =\u00a0 instructions</p>\n<p>ESC\u00a0 =\u00a0 exit game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T13:29:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09c9773393fcf0849d7b6b5bf948ebe1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jes Modian"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
