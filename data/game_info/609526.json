I liked the game, but I\u00a0wanted to put a twist to it, and make it more story driven, and use swords instead of super deadly guns. Sk0nk and I have tried our best to make Turtle Sword the best experience it can be, and I hope you like it as much as I do!</p>\n<p>Nathcra Games:\u00a0https://nathcra.itch.io/</p>\n<p>If you want to check out Sk0nk, you can find him at\u00a0https://sk0nk.itch.io/</p>\n<p><strong>Change Log:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Release 1.0:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First release of the game</p>\n<p><strong>Release 1.1:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Fixed sea urchin hitbox glitch</p>\n<p>Fixed bird hitboxes</p>\n<p>Made Pickaxes easier to fight</p>\n<p>Added missing dialogue line in Crystal Cavern</p><p>Turtle Sword is now on Mac!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:30:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cdb7eab48a5d717dad7701b7af18e50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nathcra Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
