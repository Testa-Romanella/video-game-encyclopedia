She is stuck in Limbo and must find her way out by making choices that will lead her to either Heaven, Hell or becoming a Reaper.\r\n</p>\n<p>ACT 1: Kaia finds out that she's died. She was not exactly a good person when she roamed the earth, but she wasn't evil. Instead of sending her directly to Heaven or Hell, Death decides that she must go through the trials in Limbo to determine her fate.\r\n</p>\n<p>ACT 2: Kaia wanders through Limbo facing one difficult trial after another. Each time she completes a trial it pushes her fate in one direction or another but she doesn't know in which. Each trial is designed to show how selfless, loving, cunning, she can be.\r\n</p>\n<p>ACT 3: The last trial is the most difficult. This is the final push that will seal her fate. This challenge will determine the purity of her heart. Depending on the players choice, Kaia will either end up in Heaven, Hell or working for Death as a Reaper.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T05:03:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebd/ebdaed32bf96a63df25dc5bad95b6e1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RosaPerez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
