Do you have what it takes to steer your team to victory?<h3>Important:</h3><br/>At this time you may need to use a VPN to play Forkdrift with friends in different or even the same region, unfortunately our networking setup is not perfect and it may select the wrong region.<h3>Game Features</h3><br/><ul><li><strong>ONLINE MULTIPLAYER</strong> </li></ul> With the ability to host and join lobbies anywhere in the world. Play against friends or total strangers in order to prove your skill!<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>DELIVERY MODE</strong> </li></ul> A team-based game mode where you and your friends work together to protect and transport your team\u2019s package.

Pimp your ride by choosing your favorite wheels, chassis, forks, and maybe even a fedora on top? Additionally, in Fork Frenzy, you can even change your forklift\u2019s color!<h3>Development</h3><br/>Forkdrift is developed by <strong>Endless Suffering</strong>, a dedicated team of undergrad students that completed development of Forkdrift during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has meant changing all of our development practices and techniques halfway through development in order to transition to working remotely. Despite this, we were able to soldier on by keeping the goal of providing a fun, complete, exciting game at the forefront of the team's mind. We are all proud of our work and hope you will enjoy Forkdrift as much as we do!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-22T09:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/290/290a6b78bbbb291ec75c41ccabca2a01.jpg", "website": "https://www.tinyurl.com/forkdrift", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Dartictheunic", "Endless Suffering"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Endless Suffering"], "esrb_rating": null}
