Hope you enjoy it. :)</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>This game is a submission for the third Blackthornprod Game jam.</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>Explore the whole of the mystical forest and find out many training camps to improve your skills and arenas to battle with enemies.</p>\n<p>At the start, you start out with less skills and get to train them more, thus, them being more effective in battle. But as you gain more and more skills, you cannot always train all of them. This leads to them be weaker.\u00a0 So, the less skills you have, the more you get to train them.</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:-</p>\n<p>1) Move with the WASD or Arrow keys.</p>\n<p>2) Press E when near an arena or a training camp to enter it.</p>\n<p>3) When you train an attack type skill, the defensive type skills(if you have any) you have reduce in effectiveness and vice versa for defensive type skills</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>CREDITS:-</p>\n<p>Artwork - me</p>\n<p>Coding - me</p>\n<p>Music - Youtube and me</p>\n<p>Game Idea - me</p>\n<p>=====================================</p>\n<p>Hope you have a great time playing this game! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T13:56:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b8033dbbf8a793a29e5870f8dd775d16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelBearGames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
