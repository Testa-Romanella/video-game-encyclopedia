I somehow managed to fail at both in that I jammed something brand new into an incomplete, work-in-progress state, oops!</p>\n<p>Anyway, the theme for the jam was \"artifacts\" and my inspiration came from\u00a0the recent ending to my own long-term relationship and the artifacts of \"us\" which remain.</p>\n<p>I also decided for this jam to learn how to use Ren'Py -- if you look at my past projects, you'll see I traditionally use GameMaker Studio -- so I at least was relatively successful in learning something new!</p>\n<p>This work-in-progress build offers a guided tour of my idea and intentions,\u00a0can be completed in less than 10 minutes, and adequately\u00a0showcases\u00a0the core of what this game will be -- it's mostly just missing the extensive\u00a0dialogue\u00a0writing I would need to do.</p>\n<p>Content Warning:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Occasional Adult Language</li></ul>\n<p>Player Input:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e4/7e4733ae73b89d33ceaa4774eb38ff6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rohifi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
