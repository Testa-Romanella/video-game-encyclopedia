{"id": 45921, "slug": "wooden-battles", "name": "Wooden Battles", "name_original": "Wooden Battles", "description": "<p>Wooden Conflict is a fort building battle sim. You build a wooden fort, place units, and then watch the battle unfold. To win the game you either have to destroy all of your opponent&#39;s units, or capture their flag. Units can be toggled as either &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;defensive.&quot; When units are designated for offense, they will move towards the enemy flag, engaging any enemy soldiers they encounter along the way. Units designated for defense will stay where you place them, waiting for the enemies to come to them. If there are no more offensive units left on the map, the game enters a tie breaker procedure, where all defensive units are automatically switched to offensive mode, and all forts/blocks disappear to clear the way for the soldiers. The armies from both sides will march towards each other and engage in an epic showdown. Last army standing wins.<br />\nMissions:<br />\nMissions involve different scenarios against the AI opponent. The objective is to defeat the enemy using a limited amount of resources. Strategic construction of the base, and choice of units is crucial. Carefully planning and executing your strategy is the only way to victory.<br />\nSandbox Mode:<br />\nSandbox mode allows the player to place a large number of units and build up bases for both teams. The player can use this mode to mess around with different units and experiment with different strategies.<br />\nThe game currently has five units: Rifleman, Cannon, Sniper, Musketoon, and Medic. Each unit is designed to fill a specific role on the battlefield and making smart unit choices is key to a well balanced army. The infantry units come with several weapon options which have varying stats such as accuracy, damage, and rate of fire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94a/94aff5eca20575a86a2172514b8b8e2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SP Digital Arts"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SP Digital Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
