This week went a little smoother as I think the team settled into some routine. We got some great feedback from the playtesting session and used it to add polish to our game. Some of the main changes we needed to make were improving the clarity of our objective, improved tutorial (give players more time to understand mechanics). In addition to this we wanted to continue to deepen the mechanics of the game play. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T06:13:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75dbb18cfa211b3ad37b4fbf8498368c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StudioMononoke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
