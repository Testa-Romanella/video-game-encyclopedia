It is this mood that we tried to convey with our visual style.<br/><br/><br/>The actions of the game take place on the system in which the colonization ship was sent on board which there were only autonomous machines. They were supposed to prepare the planet for the arrival of people, but no one flew to them.<br/><br/><br/>At the moment, there are two worlds available in the game:<br/><ul><li>Flat<br/></li><li>Sea</li></ul>We are also planning to add a map with planets so that you can explore them on your aircraft, build space stations and whatever your imagination wants.<br/><br/><br/>Our game has a system of logical connections, through which you can create amazing mechanisms and machines.<br/>The types of logical connections available in the game:<br/><ul><li>Bool<br/></li><li>Number<br/></li><li>String<br/></li><li>Color<br/></li><li>Vector</li></ul><br/>Also in the game there are items for entering information (constants and sensors). You can operate on data, perform mathematical operations on it, and convert one data type to another.<br/><br/><br/>So that you can diversify the items in the game and add to it what you want, we have made support for modifications. Modifications are created in the C# programming language. To make this process easier for you, we have created the ModAPI documentation.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T02:42:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de7/de74b23478a081a02b6f25540d1662d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Red Starship", "Crazy Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Red Starship"], "esrb_rating": null}
