This means you can make it yourself very easy or absolutely impossible to solve. You can also choose between 4 different matrix styles (Retro, Stone, Eye, Glass).<br/></p>\r\nHow does the control work:\r\n<p>As it is designed for a mobile game, the controls are fairly simple. Just click with the left mouse button the fields of the matrix. To rotate the matrix, click and hold the left mouse button and move the mouse. Zoom by using the mouse wheel.</p>\r\nFor what platforms will it be released:\r\n<p>This game is in beta state and only available for PC/Max/Linux until now.
