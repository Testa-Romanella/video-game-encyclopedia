A single such dice can power a whole continent for a generation. Our world will enter an age of post-scarcity!<br/>But the dice are highly unstable and will enter a supercritical state if too many accumulate. Star-system scale disaster! A single worker with a forklift rig will have to be brave enough to perform the loader-shift of their lifetime. </p>\n<p>Once the printer is turned on it won't stop, in fact it'll power up and go faster over time. Given how old this machine is, the dice it produces might become more and more anomalous. We'll try sending you upgrade blueprints to help you out. <br/></p>\n<p>Avoid creating a terminal matter accumulation events at all cost. That would be bad. We are counting on you.</p>\n\n<p>Made in 48h for GMTK Jam 2022.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How to play: </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>(w)</strong>: boost\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>(Mouse)</strong>: steer\r\n    </p>\n<p><strong>(LMouse)</strong>: load/unload dice<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/727/727b74df2db0c2250a7ca2f08ab9efbf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sleeper_games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
