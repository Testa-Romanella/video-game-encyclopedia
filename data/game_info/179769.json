Use your shield to absorb enemy fire and dodge the bullets when it is down. Every tenth shot is a special shot that clears the whole lane! Defend your crystal and defeat your foes!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use 8, 5, and 2 on the Numpad to change between each lane. Press Spacebar to shoot. Esc to pause and when you start shooting the game automatically unpauses.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>The game was made in 48 hours for the GMTK 2017 Game Jam with the theme of dual-purpose design. The bullets heal the crystal and kill enemies, as well as charging a meter for a special shot. I would love to polish up some stuff and maybe add sound to the game after judging is completed, as well as adding some extra difficulty. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>At its current state, when the player loses the game pauses and is not unpausable. You must restart the application in order to play again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/679ad844d45c355a8ab4fa93aed2682d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["samoht"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
