{"id": 794824, "slug": "magijack", "name": "Magijack", "name_original": "Magijack", "description": "<p>Magijack (mah-ghee-jack) is a roguelike-like deck-builder where the sum of card values in your hand determines whether you'll hit... But don't get too greedy: once it's over your limit, it'll hit you back!</p>\n<p>Cards contain the power of mythical beasts. Use powerful spells to channel their energy and reduce your risks, augment your cards and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>You may not reach the end first try... but the foe that defeats you, gives you a card to recall at will in your next attempt.<br/><br/>RULES (because the tutorial isn't replayable)<br/>- You can end the turn to check if you'll hit, or draw more cards to improve your chances. End the turn before you draw too many cards.<br/>- The sum of card values (numbers on card corners) in your hand can't exceed your Limit. The emptier the orb on the left, the more Limit is used up.<br/>- If you go beyond Limit, you take damage.<br/>- If you go just on the edge of Limit (the limit orb shows a 0), you perform a Guaranteed x1.5 damage attack.<br/><br/>- If you don't go on the edge of Limit, you deal damage if the sum of Powers (card values + metal pluses) is higher than your enemy's. Otherwise, the enemy attacks.<br/>- Flawless Beast cards have a huge mythical beast painting on them. They have a value of 10, but once you go beyond Limit you don't get overloaded - they turn into a 1.<br/>- Click spells (squares in the middle) and select the cards to use in them to cast the spells.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T13:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a0/8a09e3ada1df96de937049b05c4aa731.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Don Tnowe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
