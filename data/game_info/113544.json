Build up a combo by alternating goals and shadow goals and avoiding obstacles in the way, until time runs out. Keep track of your combo chain, and which ball goes where, and get the highest score you can!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c0/4c0909192f15e1ac0a3b621e95193228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glynn Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
