You can then use your collected coins to purchase these assets for your DRONE.<br/><br/><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/><br/>You will emerge from your portal and begin looking throughout the area for 5 hidden objects; these objects are randomly selected and will be revealed to you at the onset of the level timer. The level timer will continuously count down to 0, once the timer reaches 0 you have failed your search. Selecting a correct object will add several seconds to the timer; however, selecting an incorrect object will remove several seconds from the timer. You also have access to special abilities. One such ability is the option to FREEZE the level timer for a short duration to allow you the extra seconds you may need to locate your hidden objects. A secondary ability you have is the option to SCAN the environment for hidden objects that are within a set radius; this radar only lasts for a short duration. These abilities use T-coins; these T-coins can be earned by you if the level is completed within varying allotted times. The number of T-coins accrued is dependent upon how much time is remaining on the level timer. Once you have collected all 5 of the hidden objects a portal to end the level will open somewhere around you; at which point you can either enter the portal and end the level or if you wish you can explore the environment further.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T12:10:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/388/3885731901099087b7aede857070cc66.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["3GuysGaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
