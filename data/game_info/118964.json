Each bubble holds a number. You play as a \"Smasher\", a soldier equipped with a<strong> grappling hook</strong>. Using this weapon, you\u2019ll have to <strong>smash bubbles together</strong>: their numbers will then add up. <strong>Smash bubbles so their numbers match the goal number</strong> displayed on top of the screen to earn points! But beware, if your soldier get hit by a bubble, he\u2019ll explode!</p>\n\n<p>The game offers a selection of 10 \"Smashers\" to play with. Each Smasher comes with a <strong>different gameplay style</strong>: <em>ground infantry - quick but fragile; Tank - though but hard to drive; Plane - a vehicle that can\u2019t stop moving forward; etc.</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1a/d1a7789824b122d992f4a3e416a477dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dr. Ludos"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
