However, one day, it seems as though the Earth had sundered apart, and these two friends found themselves in worlds that are similar to theirs, yet distinctly different. The sky appeared to be different, and some walls that were previously solid became passable. Most distressing of all, they found themselves unable to reunite with one another.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>However, they soon discovered that they had the ability to manipulate certain objects that had an impact on both worlds. Realising this potential to work together and resolve the situation, they set out to find a solution. By obtaining magical energies in the form of fishes, they were able to open a gate and gradually merge their worlds back together. But beware, as they faced numerous obstacles along the way that threatened to thwart their efforts.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Esc: </strong>Toggle Pause</li><li><strong>X:</strong> Switch between the cats</li><li><strong>Z: </strong>Undo action</li><li><strong>R:</strong> Restart level</li><li><strong>Right and left arrow keys:</strong> Move</li><li><strong>Space:</strong> Jump</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Developer/Programmer: </strong><strong>LapisRaider</strong></li><li><strong>Designer and Producer:\u00a0damzie\u00a0</strong></li><li><strong>Artist:\u00a0<strong>jasmoomin</strong></strong></li><li><strong>QA Tester:\u00a0johnelijahgan</strong></li></ul>\n<p>All attribution to assets used is in the README.md file that can be downloaded.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T23:59:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/5398765cf225404d79a94c84b6059f3a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["LapisRaider", "jasmoomin", "johnelijahgan", "damzie"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
