{"id": 690060, "slug": "rapz-the-game", "name": "Rapz The game", "name_original": "Rapz The game", "description": "<p>Rapz! is a game for young girls based on the characters of the animated book <em>Rapulani!</em>. It is about a young girl, Rapulani, with a magical afro who must endure many great obstacles and a gauntlet of an adventure with her magical hair, just to get through the day. Her hair is quite demanding - it doesn\u2019t fit nicely into her swimming cap; her edges don\u2019t lie flat plus she has trouble finding an ok place to sit whenever she\u2019s in a public space - her hair obstructs everyone\u2019s view! The viewer must help Rapulani navigate her complicated 5 year old life and her wild hair as she tries to get through the day in order to make it to a friends\u2019 birthday party. The game aims to educate players about self love for young girls, their hair experiences and ultimately have fun while experimenting with different hairstyles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T10:07:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e348f4edee94e9041fa7c6cf073794c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Alkamaiz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
