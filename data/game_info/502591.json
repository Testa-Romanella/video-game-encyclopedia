It was a project to teach myself game design.<br/></p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>1. Left click to pop the blocks that match the \"NEXT\" indicator.</p>\n<p>2. Click on a block that doesn't match and it will turn to stone.</p>\n<p>3. Right click to unleash a limit break if your chain is huge enough. That removes stone blocks and turns mono-color blocks into rainbow blocks that you can pop whenever you want for more points.</p>\n<p>4. If you top out you lose.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think. Criticism is much appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:35:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e891b79f5d1ef8f29918a9ec78370043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pink Pixel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
