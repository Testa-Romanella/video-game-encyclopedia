I only had 2 days to do this with very limited internet access so I hope this looks okay in comparison to the other entries :).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to complete the 10-15 waves in each level within each difficulty level, easy / medium / hard. You have 3 options of defence, found in the cards at the bottom which can be clicked on and then placed at one of the given locations on the map. Good luck and I hope you have fun to anyone who is going to play this!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:58:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b2/2b270d72c981cd2d925b7692f3c585e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoldenDonkeyProductions"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
