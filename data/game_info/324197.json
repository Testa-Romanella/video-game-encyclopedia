{"id": 324197, "slug": "dwarven-skykeep", "name": "Dwarven Skykeep", "name_original": "Dwarven Skykeep", "description": "<p>Dwarven Skykeep is a Tower defense with a strong strategic presence. You will guide a Mage trying to locate the lost citadel of Dwarves. During the twelve chapters of the humorous and somewhat tragic story, you will be constructing magical Towers in unfriendly spots inhabited by Goblins, Gargoyles, Evil Mages, Octopuses, Thieves, and other enemies.<br />\nThe game is card-based. You&#39;ll have to build your deck which has a limited capacity. Across the levels and in the middle of a fight you will find new cards. Which you choose for your deck will shape your strategy in the late game.<br />\nCards are required to build the Tower, place rooms in the built blocks, spellcasting and repairs.<br />\nYou will have to make a lot of strategical decisions.<br />\nBuild rooms in a smart way. Their efficiency depends on the location inside the Tower. A Brewery produces more beer in the underground and a magical Crystal gives more mana on the top floor.<br />\nUse backup routes, fire ladders, and doors. You can foretell the future in the Observatory to be well prepared for it.<br />\nMake up the combat tactics. Don\u2019t send melee fighters against kamikaze bombers and make sure you don\u2019t cast a Lightning Bolt against a Mirror spell bearer. Instead, build Barricades, fortify your walls and prepare your magic by studying in the Library.<br />\nExpand the underground floors. You can find many surprises there, some useful and some dangerous. Save yourself some nerves by predicting the consequences with the Eye spell. Or dig the earth and hope for the better. Just keep your firefighting team nearby.<br />\nPractice the Alchemy. It may be your last chance to win, but the Lab is so explosive. So better conduct your experiments in the remote rooms.<br />\nCast spells. You\u2019re a Mage after all. Use Hold, Lightning Bolt and Fireball against enemies. Reflect magic attack with Mirrors. Use Rain to put down fires (or order Dwarves to put down fires if you failed).<br />\nThe Dwarven Skykeep Awaits You.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T05:33:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d5648e81eae25b6e1599bbf0fec8790.jpg", "website": "https://hedin-hiervard.itch.io/dwarven-skykeep", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 12, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 22, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hack The Publisher", "Hedin"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ravenage Games", "East2West Games", "Hack The Publisher"], "esrb_rating": null}
