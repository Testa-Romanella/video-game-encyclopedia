It is progressing game, where you need to run from the Minotaur, and if you can possibly defeat it! You can progress over time getting more stronger, and it is easier to kill the Minotaur!</p>\n<p>This game was developed by University students from S.A.E. London, for some this game is the second game ever developed, for some it is the first! It was a really funny experience, even though we couldn't polish the game as much as we wanted and everything was breaking last minute. It was a good experience, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>We learned a lot in this project, which was what we were most looking forward to! Since this was everyone's first jam, it was very frustrating but very cool to work so closely and the team kept motivating each other!!</p>\n<p>Sadly we couldn't put the game in the web sorry!</p>\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p>Right click - Bring torch up, can light other torches if close enough.<br/>Left click - Attack if you have a sword<br/>W-A-S-D - Move<br/>E - open chest, grab torch from wall</p><p>R - To withdraw Sword<br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/escape-the-minotaur</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Pedro Rainha</p>\n<p>Jo\u00e3o Guilherme</p>\n<p>Freddy Hodge<br/></p>\n<p>Tachan Harris</p>\n<p>Oliver Price</p>\n<p>Umair Qazi</p>\n<p>Pierre Anisimov<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:08:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac4d27cc0e955fe3f33cc2e5a5b3d288.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pedro Rainha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
