There are many obstacles of different kinds and many more solutions. Which one you use is up to you. For example, a river has many ways to be approached, will you simply swim through it; or maybe build a drakkar to sail across it while staying dry. Exploring leads you to a bridge to cross by foot. It seems guarded, maybe, those people will let you pass for some gold but you prefer paying them in steel. The temperature fell and now the river is frozen, you could have waited instead of fought, great you can scavenge the bodies to get some warm clothes,  but will the wounds and fatigue of the battle slow you down too much to continue ?. Anyway, there is only one way and it is forward. Perhaps you should have taken more time to plan and think but would you have taken more, someone or something might have made the choice for you. There is no wrong choices just ones harder to take responsibility for.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b89/b89c75022e3760b2e07e19afd215cb41.jpg", "website": "http://www.carvingfatetovalhalla.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fruits of Yggdrasil Studio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Fruits of Yggdrasil Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
