{"id": 843387, "slug": "moodlings", "name": "Moodlings", "name_original": "Moodlings", "description": "<p>Moodlings is a game about you, and dozens of creatures called Moodlings. The goal of the game is to survive a 7 day work week at a ranch, where Moodlings sprout up from the ground. You will need to make sure Moodlings\u00a0\u00a0(Sicklings)\u00a0 that turn sick &amp;\u00a0 Moodlings (Murderlings)\u00a0that turn evil don't disrupt your daily Moodling quota.\u00a0Otherwise you will get fired.\u00a0You also have to make sure you don't die on the job...<br/></p>\n<p>The game was a solo project for the Brackeys 2022.2 Game Jam. Please play the game in full screen so you get the most accurate view of the games graphics.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>-WASD to move</p>\n<p>-Left mouse click to fire Pacifier(gun)</p>\n<p>-Right mouse click to use Cleanser</p>\n<p>-G key to use grenade</p>\n<p><strong>Tips\u00a0(Read only if you find the game hard)</strong></p>\n<p>-Positioning is the most important tool in your arsenal.\u00a0Search for areas where there aren't many Moodlings so you can have a clear shot in quickly culling Muderlings and Sicklings.\u00a0Moodlings are also quite small. By constantly being on the move you should get numerous lines of sights to your targets.</p>\n<p>-Don't be afraid to sacrifice Moodlings.\u00a0If a single Moodling is blocking your line of sight killing them is a small price to be ready\u00a0for the next changling.\u00a0Also having too many Moodlings can be an issue if sickness starts to spread.\u00a0Try to balance out your Moodlings to your near day quotas.</p>\n<p>-Use grenades on Murderlings due to their 2 hit health. By throwing a grenade at a Murderling and then firing at them you will most likely kill them (and their target) very quickly.\u00a0This is especially efficient due to their standing cooldown after an attack.</p>\n<p>-Use the Cleanser when it seems you're about to have a sickling outbreak.\u00a0Be careful with timing as the cooldown is long.\u00a0The Cleanser can also be used as a predictive measure whilst you go after other types of Moodlings in later days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T11:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d6/4d6ef88fa8bb35632d9d26986cf903c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IceVein"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
