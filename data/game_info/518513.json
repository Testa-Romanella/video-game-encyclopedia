Somehow stuck in this frozen waste with no knowledge of how she got there, seemingly stuck in an endless loop with no other option than moving forward.\u00a0You need to help her\u00a0navigate slippery ice to get back home, all the while trying to stay away from that strange wolf\u00a0and not collapsing from the cold.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A strange wolf</strong>\u00a0seems to appear out of nowhere and chase you. Not sure why, just\u00a0don't get caught.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Staying warm is crucial</strong>\u00a0in arctic conditions, keep an eye on Elin and how she reacts to the cold or she will never leave that ice. Make sure to always warm\u00a0your feet when you have a campfire nearby.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>No information</strong>\u00a0will be supplied by a UI, navigate through the game with only your wits, memory and small inputs from Elin.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Sliding</strong>\u00a0can be dangerous, the slippery ice will not present any way to change direction or stop. Make sure you aim properly when you enter the ice or you'll get wet.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Finding skates</strong>\u00a0can help massively if there is no way to just slide straight. With skates you can turn, however keep in mind that being the novice ice skater that Elin is, she still does not know how to stop.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Animals can be cute</strong>\u00a0to look at, but they can also be dangerous. While traversing the ice you need to make sure you don't crash into a playful penguin.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Unforgiving</strong>\u00a0is the name of the game (no it's not), it is not possible to save whenever, saves can only be made at campfires.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Nighttime</strong>\u00a0can be both helpful and detrimental, choose if you want to tackle a level in daylight or in the dark. During the night, many animals are asleep, however it might be difficult to see.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Interested in <strong>A Week In The Cold</strong>?
