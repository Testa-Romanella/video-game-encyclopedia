Enemies/coins are also randomly placed after generation.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The lovely music was done by\u00a0Alex James.\r\n</p>\n<p>The art for the battle screen/mechs/UI and programming was done by\u00a0juniper_dusk (me).</p>\n<p>The city overworld uses\u00a0this tilemap\u00a0from Adam Saltsman. The Monogram font by datagoblin was also used.\r\n</p>\r\nFuture Improvements\r\n<p>The combat system code is inspired by OpenRPG, so it is mostly modular and would hold up over development.\u00a0The original game design featured a party of pilots that would operate one mech together, each being able to perform different actions like repairing, operating weapons, and moving.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T06:41:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd2ac1acae370be524db5bcca3680109.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["juniper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
