Once you have mastered the simple levels, you'll have to handle two or more balls at the same time!<br/><br/>PIVOTO is easy to learn but challenging to master.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T02:30:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e30/e30abec8b0722f82dcfbdd78f0c7af0c.jpg", "website": "http://www.pivotogame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Hadrien Boyer"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Hadrien Boyer"], "esrb_rating": null}
