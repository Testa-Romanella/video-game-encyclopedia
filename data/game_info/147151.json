It is a game with 7 commands that all mean \"vomit\" (not to mention a variety of other biological necessities), so I am confident that I accomplished that goal.<br/><p>I started working on this game in January 2016 as a submission to the Ryan Veeder Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction. But time got short, and when I realized I couldn't get it done, I felt so embarrassed about the state of its completion that I didn't want to submit it (even though an email update assured us that unfinished games were okay.)  <br/></p><p>But Bring Out Your Dead is a WIP event, so... here it is, Ryan. Happy belated birthday!<br/><br/>The photo is my dog Megabit, taken today in a different context. He makes this face often, but I rarely capture it on camera.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about this game, I wrote up my design notes (and provided the source code) at Sibyl Moon. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22ed19e9fedb405076956aed0c7982d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cvaneseltine"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
