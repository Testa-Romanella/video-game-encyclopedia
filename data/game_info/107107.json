You will cast and dodge elemental spells to destroy the enemies and survive.</p>\n<p>In each multiplayer battle, players are divided in two 4-player teams. Players can attack using a variety of elemental spells, which can also be combined to form even more powerful ones. As a defence, players can either choose to dodge spells or can raise an energy shield than can provide temporary protection. Each player controls a platform and can teleport themselves onto other platforms using a spell.<br/><br/>Clash of Spells is a skill-based game where players need to use their aim and reflexes to beat other players. Despite being a competitive game, Clash of Spells also encourages team play, as players can heal other team members and coordinate their attack to deal more damage to the enemy team.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>4 vs 4 team deathmach multiplayer mode</li><li>Bots</li><li>16 different spells</li><li>3 game maps</li><li>More to come</li></ul>\r\nRequirements\r\n<ul><li>Any VR headset supported by SteamVR</li><li>Any Windows version supported by SteamVR</li><li>Any hardware that meets the minimum requirements for SteamVR</li><li>Basically you only need SteamVR</li></ul>\r\nItch.io version\r\n<p>The version of the game that you can download below\u00a0doesn't support the online features.
