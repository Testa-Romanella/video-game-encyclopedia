I highly recommend you to go through the first episode first and some basic skills are still useful in this game.</p>\n<p>A gardener plants flowers after each step and one wants to plant flowers in all pots and only in pots. But now the gardener could push flowers in front of him.\u00a0The same flowers would follow the standard match-3 rule even with more than 3 flowers are matched in a row. T-shape and L-shape matches are also available and when more than 5 flowers matched at the same time a bigger flower survives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a hard game that requires you to discover some specific patterns of movement that could help you through the whole game. The modular 3 property is introduced naturally by match-3 rule that would prompt you to carefully calculate the state of player on board.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T08:14:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be4dd30ccd33aa643f7ed7641b4a3725.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hungwei"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
