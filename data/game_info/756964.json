The game features authentic fighting sounds from films and a licensed soundtrack with great music from classic kung fu movies. <br/><br/>Shaolin vs Wutang is a real love letter to classic 70's and 80's Kung Fu cinema. This is a indie passion project that was made by one person who has tremendous passion for, and knowledge of Kung Fu films. It is not my intention to provide the same experience as big budget fighting games. But rather I hope to provide players with a satisfying gaming experience blended with nostalgia and reminiscence of the great Kung Fu films.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>+ 5 game modes.<br/>+ 27 characters.<br/>+ 20 stages.<br/>+ Play using the touch screen or a compatible controller.<br/>+ Local multiplayer using two compatible controllers.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T07:11:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59f/59feb8f7e0b24b3d80506ba362bbe29c_tJsdfhg.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 550, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Gutierrez Palma"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["David Gutierrez Palma"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
