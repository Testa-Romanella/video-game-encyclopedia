I spent a lot of time thinking about what the soul of vaporwave is and what attracts us. It is difficult to have an accurate answer, but we may all have imagined such a picture: driving a car on the highway, listening to music, and watching the vaporwave art scenery outside the window. So I decided to make this picture to a VR game.<br/><br/>Some of the art models and music in the game come from my other two games \"Vaporwave World\" and \"Vaporwave Drift\".<h3>Game Features</h3><br/><ul><li>Drive a car with a sense of science fiction.<br/></li><li>You can open the car window to feel the wind outside the window.<br/></li><li>Local music and pictures can be imported.<br/></li><li>Vaporwave world atmosphere.<br/></li><li>4 maps.<br/></li><li>7 music.<br/></li><li>Simple and easy game experience.<br/></li><li>Support Steam achievements and Steam leaderboards.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Drive a car on an endless road.<br/></li><li>Watch the vaporwave scenery.<br/></li><li>Local music can be imported into car music library,</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T03:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2a46bca0ee320663d5abc3c3feee92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meng Games"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meng Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
