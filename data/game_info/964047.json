{"id": 964047, "slug": "flock-of-the-low-god-vr", "name": "Flock of the Low God VR", "name_original": "Flock of the Low God VR", "description": "Based on the new feature film, <strong>MALUM</strong>, Flock of the Low God VR immerses gamers in the horrifying world of the \"The Flock\", and pits them against an onslaught of cult members and creatures as they attempt to breach the confines of Lanford Police Department. Put on the badge, grab a weapon, and fight off The Flock and the entities they've conjured before it's too late. Play alone, or gather your friends, and prepare for a combat-based VR survival horror experience like no other. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Flock of the Low God is made to be played in 12 minute \"shifts,\" each spotting your character with minimal resources that change each time you spawn. <br/><br/>Gameplay will be fast and intense but will require the player to be strategic in how they defend the station. Playing in Co-Op mode will open up a new world of collaboration between you and your partner, and the tools that you have to hide, fortify and fight for you lives against John Malum's \"flock.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>Developer's Note: <br/><br/>Top Right Corner is releasing a demo of this game around the theatrical roll out of the film Malum, which I also produced, but the development won't stop there. We plan to unveil updates pretty consistently over the coming months as we bring the game to the world via Early Access. VR development is difficult and time consuming! Getting your feedback is so important. Tell us what you think could be improved and what features/characters you'd like us to expand.
