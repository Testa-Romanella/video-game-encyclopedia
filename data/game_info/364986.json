One year after saving Kingsport High at the junior prom, you\u2019ve graduated, and you\u2019re working as a counselor at a sleepaway camp before heading off to college. You\u2019re in charge of a cabin full of nine- and ten-year-olds, responsible for taking care of them and teaching them everything you know. But you\u2019re also enjoying a summer of freedom: you\u2019re away from your parents and on your own. <br/><br/>Camp Cedarcrest has its share of mysteries. Why do the people in the camp\u2019s photos look like they never age? Why is the groundskeeper always lurking on the edges of the camp? Why can\u2019t your friends remember what happened last summer?  And what about the ghost stories? Generations of campers tell stories about seeing the White Lady floating through the woods.<br/><br/>When you meet the White Lady and her companions, you discover that what\u2019s really going on in the forest is even stranger than just ghosts - and when you find a powerful source of new magic, you also discover that it comes with a high price. How far are you willing to go to preserve or destroy it? <br/><br/>And how are you ever going to figure that out while you\u2019ve got a dozen kids looking to you for the answers to their life\u2019s questions? Are you even ready for that? You\u2019re still just a kid yourself. But you\u2019re the only person who can save the camp \u2013 and the only one who can make the big choices about how to use the magic that you\u2019ve discovered.<br/><br/>All your friends from Kingsport High are just a text away: you can always look to your best friend for support, ask the editor of the school newspaper to help with research, or sneak a date with your hometown sweetheart.<br/><br/>Sing songs around the campfire, eat s\u2019mores, make friendships that will last forever.<br/><br/><ul><li>       Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, or bi.<br/></li><li>       Find summer love with your co-counselor or a mysterious stranger; or deepen your relationship with your high school sweetheart.<br/></li><li>       Learn magic from a powerful mentor, and teach magic to a new generation.<br/></li><li>       Earn your campers\u2019 love \u2013 or just ignore them and have your own fun.<br/></li><li>       Win Colorwars!<br/></li><li>       Save Camp Cedarcrest \u2013 or decide that it\u2019s better off closed.<br/></li><li>       Explore a secretive society and its powerful magic.<br/></li><li>       Be a good influence on your campers, or teach them to be troublemakers, just like you.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e258e5bcf82cdbfe2c4e067553ffa5f0.jpg", "website": "https://www.choiceofgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Choice of Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choice of Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
