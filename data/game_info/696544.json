The beauty of it is that it can only be played in virtual reality, as it has elements that are not possible to recreate in real life</p>\n<p>Currently, Zen Fighters is in early alpha stage, not open for public playing yet. However, we host weekly test sessions where up to 20 people meet up inside the same fighting arena and play together to try and break the game, and have fun in general.
