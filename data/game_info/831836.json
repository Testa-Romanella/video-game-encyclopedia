Sneak your way to steal the objective using epic spy gadgets!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Characters</strong><br/>Choose from 7 distinct playable characters, each equipped with a different set of gadgets, or weaponry ranging from SMGs to sniper rifles depending on if you and your crew are there to cause chaos or to defend!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Objectives</strong><br/>Multiple objectives are randomly spawned across the map, so every match is different from the last one. The defending team doesn't know which one of the objectives is the one they need to defend, so they must keep an eye out for all of them!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Ashkeep is designed more with casual gameplay in mind with its asymmetrical gameplay. The defending team has full loadouts with weapons, while the attacking team has to survive with gadgets such as drones, spy cameras, and footstep sensors.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T04:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/147/147e66985d98f1e099a40fa348db030a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dryrope"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dryrope"], "esrb_rating": null}
