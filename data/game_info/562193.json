This game is for the Brackeys game jam 2021.1, the game is complete garbage, I made it, and I recommend you don't play it as I have previously stated it is garbage. If you do decide to play it, here are some instructions: You are a blob person, you can defeat enemy blob people by bumping into them, but you take damage when you defeat an enemy but you can recruit other nice blob people when you bump into them, they increase your health, that's pretty much it, the game is trash, don't play it. (also, the reason it's not very good is because i pretty much only had a day to make it)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b66317c2cab18fedbcb869f42493ab61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chikin_Bukit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
