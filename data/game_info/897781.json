Still very new to Unity and C#, and the game didn't exactly end up like I'd planned, but I still managed to finish it, at least, and hopefully it functions without too many bugs. I think I forgot to add a character's name somewhere, and footstep sound effects definitely would've been nice to add if I'd had the time. Still, even if it didn't quite turn out how I'd hoped, I hope you can still enjoy what's here.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left click or the right shoulder button to shoot.</p>\n<p>Shift or the left trigger to run.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed8a46a4bca36afc53636270d34b2d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Amber Evans"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
