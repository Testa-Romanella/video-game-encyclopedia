The player can use the \u201cSpace\u201d key to control the character: Moai The Stone Head to jump around the seaside and collect golden coins to achieve the game\u2019s core goal but watch out. The gray \u201cOops Coin\u201d will bring you further from the final victory.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>My goal is to make a chill game that players can play to kill some time and get a vacation-like feeling while listening to the background music. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>The difficulties I encountered were mainly based on coding, and I found it tricky to make all those variables work together as a beginner of C#. I hadn\u2019t used Unity before the project, but I had a good time learning new technics when designing this game. When dealing with the problems I met, I gained a lot of great help from the course\u2019s instructing team and my classmates. Thanks for the help :) \r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t use any premade assets from outside resources except the C# scripts posted on the tutorial site, I made my character, background art and UI, and the music is originally from \u201cSummer Cozy Rock\u201d (\u590f\u65e5\u6f31\u77f3) written by Orange Sea (\u6a58\u5b50\u6d77)\uff0c I rearranged the song to a more simple but catchy rhythm to use as my background music, which is played by myself using my instruments and edited with GarageBand, thanks a lot Fender and Apple Company!\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T15:54:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/078/0782701fada04f8982037e37204d76b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Bishop_79"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
