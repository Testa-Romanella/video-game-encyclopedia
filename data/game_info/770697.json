These can't hurt the player, however they can be stomped to be killed or used as platforms. Once you become a zenglin, you will take control of a new penguin and can retravel the level to hopefully make it to the goal.\u00a0You also become a zenglin whenever you die.</p>\n<p>I wanted this to be longer but I didn't notice the jam had started until like 5 days ago so I had to move kinda fast lol</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:03:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/014e300694fdfe645c0cc93fabb32198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DucksIncoming"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
