As you progress through the level, you will discover upgrades that allow you to enhance your mobility. Thrusters allow you to briefly hover. Use your dagger to grind along rails, gain momentum and reach parts of the level you couldn't otherwise. But your dagger isn't just for movement. It is a Dagger after all.
