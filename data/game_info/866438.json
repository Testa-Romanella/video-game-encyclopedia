You need to find a way to escape his house without getting caught and murdered. You have to choose between 5 difficulties on which one you're going to play. The harder difficulty is,  the atmosphere gets darker, and Mr. White gets faster. You can submit your score (the time it took you to finish) on an online leaderboard specific to the difficulty that you've chosen (practice, easy, medium...) so you can compete with other players and see who can escape White's house for the least time period. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCONTROLS:<br/>\r\nMovement: W, A, S, D<br/>\r\nLSHIFT - Run<br/>\r\nLMB - Open Doors, Drawers, Hide under the Bed, and Pickup Items<br/>\r\nQ - Drop Items", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T04:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee121339d40145e48bdae405de832fc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lorex Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lorex Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
