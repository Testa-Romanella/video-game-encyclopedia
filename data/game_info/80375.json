Sound easy? It is, unless you want a high score! You have to pop groups in the right order to form bigger groups and get more points.<br/><br/>Compare PopGroup to other games based on the same concept:<br/>- Crystal-clear graphics<br/>- Animations<br/>- Customizable width, height, and number of bubble colors<br/>- Online high scores<br/>- No in-app ads or in-app purchases!<br/><br/>PopGroup is made by the developer of tChess (the popular iOS chess app), and Learn Chess (the Apple Staff Favorite e-book).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b6/0b65bceee52826de566ef4c492b3074e.jpg", "website": "http://www.roamingtrek.com/popgroup/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tom Kerrigan"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Tom Kerrigan"], "esrb_rating": null}
