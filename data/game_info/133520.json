You follow the story of a young woman named Val\u00e9ria Silva, which lives in a small mining vilage. this vilage is often being attacked by machines, which take their earnings from the mines. One day after she comes back from her hunting trip, she decides it's time to fight back.\u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Eulogies of Heroes has a choice driven stat-progression system, in which YOU can decide what your character focusses on. By unlocking nodes, you increase stats, learn passive abilities and unlock special abilities! If you unlock all nodes within a group, you even get a special reward!</p>\n<p>Eulogies of Heroes' battle system is a combination between traditional turn-based battle systems and MMORPG's class systems. Each character has it's own special abilities! Special abilities cost SP, which is regenerated by dealing and receiving damage. Each character also has it's own mechanic, which helps them fulfill their role in battle. From charging an \"Overdrive\" ability, which allows you to create an almost endless combo on a single enemy, to increasing your magic attack by using a physical attack and vice versa, each character has it's very own way to create havoc on the battlefield!</p>\n<p><em>Val\u00e9ria's Overdrive ability, Shock and Awe, deals high AoE lightning damage and has a chance to stun enemies! (See the first image)</em></p>\r\nRaids\r\n<p>Raids are big scale battles in which your team gets split up in different groups. These groups each have their own assignment to fullfill to make the mission a success. You can create these groups yourself or you can decide to take the recommended groups for the task. Once you started the raid, you can control 1 of the teams. There are terminals around the dungeon which will let you switch team. If you want to complete the dungeon, you will need to solve several puzzles involving all teams out in the battlefield.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb63c1ae2efa0c0325bbbdb5f70545c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bladesofhonor"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
