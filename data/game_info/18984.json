Choose from a variety of ships, each equipped with unique features and abilities. Embark on your mission to tunnel through the strengthening alien invasion, find it\u2019s source, and save the galaxy! Go it alone or assemble a squad of your friends to battle in the most unforgiving corners of the universe!<br/><br/><strong>Please note, because of Engine limitations, mouse control is not yet supported on Galacide's in-game menus. We hope to bring support in the future.</strong><br/><br/><br/>In Galacide, you must carefully strike a balance between fighting the enemy and tunneling through the encroaching Bitwall, as neglecting either will assuredly result in your demise.
