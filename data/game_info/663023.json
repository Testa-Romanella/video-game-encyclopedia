The free demo contains roughly the first 30-40 minutes of what is planned as a longer game.</p>\n<p>In the world of Wizmagonster, problems are solved with teamwork. Your creature friends can perform actions like lifting, climbing, chopping, thinking, hugging, racing, hiding and more. However, their unique traits make them better suited for some jobs more\u00a0than others. You\u2019ll have to decide who\u2019s best for the task at hand.</p>\n<p>If you want to help a wide range of people, you\u2019ll need to make a lot of friends. Explore every nook and cranny of the wilderness and you just might meet someone with a unique and useful talent. But watch out: the terrain is treacherous!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Explore the wilderness and befriend a wide range of unique creatures\r\n</li><li>Overcome challenging hazards with help of your new friends\r\n</li><li>Use their special abilities to help people solve problems\r\n</li><li>Gain influence among your peers to access new areas\r\n</li><li>Bond with your creature friends through shared experiences, and watch them gain new traits and forms as they grow\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\nMe\r\n<p>I am a solo developer, and this is my first project.
