The host is running around getting ready to serve <strong>TEA </strong>&amp; <strong>SWEETS</strong> for all to enjoy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not everything is ready to be served. So with each round, the host will serve 4 items to the table.</p>\n<p>All <strong>BLACK </strong>cards are <strong>TEA</strong>.</p>\n<p>All <strong>RED </strong>cards are <strong>SWEETS</strong>.</p>\n<p>You are asked to help yourself, by taking one item from the center of the table.</p>\n<p>But please remember to be polite:\r\n<strong>DO NOT TAKE TOO MANY SWEETS.</strong></p>\n<p>Once the last item has been taken, the party is over. And like every party, the host will judge everyone and their etiquette.</p>\n<p>Anyone caught with <strong>MORE SWEETS THAN TEA</strong>\u00a0 will become a social outcast. They may not participate in any after-party awards the host may have planned.</p>\n<p>The host will reward whoever has better balanced their meal with wonderful\u00a0 compliments. Your friends will undoubtedly compliment you as well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T08:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f0/7f07e05c3b079c6ab9c0ca6a2672c00e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goblin Cookies"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
