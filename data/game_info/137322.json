Rather than dare face the nightmare that is shopping on Christmas Eve, Lieve instead embarks into the depths of the Krampulian Abyss in search of its treasures (which, legends say, all make great gifts!)</p>\n<p>This is a short action game where you search out presents. But Lieve can't fight, so she has no choice but to flee the monsters she finds. Includes:</p>\n<ul><li>An underground dungeon to explore!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>15 gifts to collect (only ten of which you actually need to beat the game)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Done-at-the-last-minute art! (and the characters don't match the in-game art-style at all!)</li></ul>\n<p>In December of 2014, I started putting this game together (At the last minute, you might say). I hope you enjoy this short, silly adventure!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e510e48c45aeae983e5012e486ad99b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["unity"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
