Soon enough you were diving head first into a new fandom. Will your heart be steady enough to embrace these new relationships or will the stress of it all cause you to make choices you wished to forget?\"\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>///\r\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the mid 00\u2019s, everything is going well! Until it\u2019s not, until you\u2019re stressed and overwhelmed with the realisation that university is over soon. Hopping on the procrastination train is the best option, you take a breather from assignments and relax, I mean it is getting late and you\u2019re getting\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0hungry. You stop on a show for a few minutes, but wait, it\u2019s? actually good? That doesn\u2019t usually happen..but I mean it couldn\u2019t hurt to watch right?...\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2026.\r\n</p>\n<p>Online @ the perfect time follows you, a student in their final year of university, overwhelmed with what\u2019s to come afterwards. After stumbling across a new anime, you decide to search the web for something more, anything, to elevate your stress and continue this train of procrastination.\r\n</p>\n<p>Nothing is thought of it at first, until you meet a group of new friends who are more welcoming than you could\u2019ve ever imagined. This visual novel explores friendship, romance (<em>hopefully)\u00a0</em>and a whole lot of 00\u2019s dumbassery.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is a small demo made for Otome Jam 2022!
