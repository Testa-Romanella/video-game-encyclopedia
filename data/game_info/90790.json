You and your opponent use both of your sticks to control dots (that somehow figured out how to hold a weapon) as they're tethered to a line . With more speed comes a longer sword and a more fatal strike. Flail yourself around like a tetherball wielding a greatsword or keep your blade dagger-sized by playing careful and precise. Don't get pushed too far back or it's the end of the line!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This version was created for Train Jam 2015 (Tutorial/title added post-jam)</p>\n<p>Requires two controllers to play (esc to exit)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fcc98a9895a973c0945dda56d411267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chris Wade", "mint", "wtrebella"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
