In order to differentiate the game from the project I have made the following changes:</p>\n<p>1. New lighting fitting the games theme and location</p>\n<p>2. Story-led game with text-based cutscene elements</p>\n<p>3. Three unique levels with special challanges</p>\n<p>4. Tutorial menu and Objective menu in-game.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game.</p>\n<p>Created by: Daryl (Bard) Peel with assets from MSU</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:51:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18ed15e67c278ccbbb8832911b508049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["bard"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
