I have been developing some of my own scripts, working hard on the story and mechanics. This is not a small game, compare to my previous works, but I assure you it will bring tension, drama and good atmosphere.\u00a0<br/><br/>All the assets are premade, the rest is done by me, which includes story, mechanics, AI, combat and texturing. Thanks a lot for showing me great support, I can't express my gratitude enough towards all of you, who visit my page and share the experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Movement\r\n      </p> <p>W,A,S,D\r\n     </p> <p>Interaction\r\n      </p> <p>LMB (Left Mouse Button)\r\n     </p> <p>Sprint/Run\r\n      </p> <p>Shift\r\n     </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T07:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4e/d4ea91206fc3809dfe8bfc45954852b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Niven Hedinger"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
