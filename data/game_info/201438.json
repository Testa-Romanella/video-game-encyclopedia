The farmers aren't happy to have you around zombifying their friends, so naturally they lob their handy pocket crucifixes at you. Dodge their crosses, hover over them to trap them, and bring them to the Zombification Altar at the east end of the field to dispose of them and capture their souls. Zombify all the farmers to win!</p>\n<p><strong>How my submission matches the theme</strong></p>\n<p>My dual-purpose design takes the form of the\u00a0<strong>farmers</strong>, who are simultaneously\u00a0<strong>enemies</strong>\u00a0who throw projectiles at you and\u00a0<strong>collectibles\u00a0</strong>needed to win the game. Much of the challenge of the game is in this duality; you have to move evasively towards the farmers if you want to catch them without getting hurt!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Made using Unity 5.6.2</li><li>All sprites made in Pixen 3.5.9</li><li>Splash screen made in Microsoft Powerpoint 15.33</li><li>Music made in Apple Garageband 10.2.0</li><li>All art, music, and coding is my own work</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c77/c778fd0a91d761edf47854418411d6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Greg Szypko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
