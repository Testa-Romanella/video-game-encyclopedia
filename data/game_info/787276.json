Defeat the main boss in each area, to progress to the next.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is around 2-4 hours depending on how good you are :D <br/>\u00a0around 1 hour / area)<br/><br/>It might be a bit repetitive at the end, but I still wanted to share it. I\u00a0had a lot of fun making it, and I learned a lot.
