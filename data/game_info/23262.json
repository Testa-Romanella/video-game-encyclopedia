Doc made sure that our little cute robot and his friends work on electric power. Most of the puzzles are focused on searching of optimal ways of finding gold and precious stones so that the robot\u2019s energy charge doesn't go flat before fulfilling all the tasks. In this game the energy is spent on every action: moving, blocs destroying, fighting with enemy (needs more power than usual), and resource searching.<br/><br/>We identified a few game features to make you understand what it represents:<br/><br/><strong>Little Diggel</strong> \u2013 is a game-adventure with a dynamic story, pretty 2D-graphics design and interesting characters that will impress kids starting from the age of six, and will also be enjoyed by adult players.<br/>In this game you will need to find 14 precious gems hidden on every level in order to open the door with the treasure hidden behind it.<br/>Gained gold can be spent on buying tools and upgrades (axe, radar, dynamite, teleport, crutch, and rucksack). These tools are your support in searching for optimal ways, they help to crush the blocks spending less energy and overcome obstacles that can\u2019t be overcome without them.<br/>3 game characters with unique powers that can help to complete the level in different ways.<br/>There is no violence in this game. Enemies that are painted in cartoon style can only reduce the amount of power that is needed by robots for the successful completion of the mission.<br/>There are no annoying elements: you don\u2019t need to press the buttons quickly moving about the platforms and there's no need to watch the time. Instead of it, in \"Little Diggel\" you need to think of your actions. All the traps can be passed, overcome or disarmed due to the attentive research of the levels, not the speed of a player's reaction.<br/>The game is easy to learn, but it's hard to become a master. Even a successful completion of the level doesn\u2019t guarantee that you have found all the stashes and treasures on the map!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c6/7c6b20821b0835ca1dc3ef13d1aa6cb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dream Clay Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Enjoy Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
