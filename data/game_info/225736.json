The game is very easy to learn; it will be love at first play! Simply rotate and place shapes into the grid to form solid connecting lines across or down. The solid lines are cleared from the board allowing you to continue placing more shapes! Use your skills of organisation and planning to ensure you never run out of space! Sounds too easy? Give it a go! <br/><br/>The pure \"minimal\" puzzle gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, but the game is more of a brain teaser than a fast paced arcade game. If you enjoy Bejeweled, Trism, thinking games like Sudoku, or my other game CornerChaos, you're sure to enjoy this too!<br/><br/>FEATURES:<br/>- Very simple to learn<br/>- 20 Levels to work through<br/>- Relaxed Mode (Take your time!)<br/>- Up to 74 different shapes!<br/>- Online Score Tracking and World Tables.<br/>- Auto-save and auto-continue", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T05:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/1401f44388317d150ab878160173e950.jpg", "website": "http://www.shoecaketouch.com/boxikon/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Paul Burkey"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Paul Burkey"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
