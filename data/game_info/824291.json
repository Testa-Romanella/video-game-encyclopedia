All rooms in\u00a0<strong>Level 0</strong>\u00a0appear uniform and share superficial features such as yellowed wallpaper, damp carpeting, electrical outlets, and inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting. However, no two rooms within the level are identical.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 1:\u00a0</strong>Habitable Zone:\u00a0<strong>Level 1</strong>\u00a0is a massive warehouse with concrete floors and walls, exposed rebar, dim fluorescent lights placed on the walls and a low-hanging fog with no discernible source. The fog often coalesces into condensation, forming puddles on the floor in inconsistent areas. Unlike\u00a0<strong>Level 0</strong>, this level possesses a consistent supply of water and electricity, which allows indefinite habitation by wanderers providing that appropriate precautions are taken. It is also far more expansive, possessing staircases, elevators, isolated rooms, and hallways.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 2:\u00a0</strong>Pipe Dreams:\u00a0<strong>Level 2</strong>\u00a0consists of long, dim concrete maintenance hallways with steam pipes lining the walls and ceilings. Doors are rarely found, housing metal shelves, and ventilation ducts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 3:</strong> Electrical Station:\u00a0<strong>Level 3</strong>\u00a0is an expansive complex of thin brick hallways and electrical machinery. Countless randomly segmented rooms are present across the level in no particular pattern. In addition, pipes line the walls and ceilings of the level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 4:\u00a0</strong>Abondoned Office:\u00a0<strong>Level 4</strong>\u00a0appears to be an empty office building completely devoid of furniture. Certain rooms in this level have windows.</p>\n\n<p>*\u00a0<strong>Level 5:\u00a0</strong>Terror Hotel:\u00a0<strong>Level 5</strong>\u00a0is a presumably infinite hotel complex, with many rooms and halls. The level itself seems to have been constructed in the 1930s, with furniture dating back to 1920. There are three main areas in\u00a0<strong>Level 5</strong>: The Main Hall, The Beverly Room, and The Boiler Room.</p>\n\n<p>* <strong>Level 6:\u00a0</strong>Lights Out:\u00a0<strong>Level 6</strong>\u00a0is an expansive complex of indeterminate size, made up of metallic walls, brick floors, and complex systems of pipes. The entirety of\u00a0<strong>Level 6</strong>\u00a0is shrouded in complete darkness; thus far, no light sources have successfully created any light in the level.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 7:</strong> Thalassophobia:\u00a0<strong>Level 7</strong>\u00a0is unique in that it is a vast expanse of water that appears to stretch on endlessly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 8:\u00a0</strong>Cave Systems:\u00a0<strong>Level 8</strong>\u00a0is an expansive cave system, infamous for the numerous spider-like entities which inhabit it. Only a few light sources can be found randomly throughout the ceilings of these caves, though these too will go dark after only a few minutes of exposure, making exploration of this level extremely difficult and dangerous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>* Level 9:\u00a0</strong>The Suburbs:\u00a0<strong>Level 9</strong>\u00a0is a seemingly endless suburban landscape, with the time of day being locked to midnight. This Level has the same darkness similar to that of Level 6\u00a0and Level -100, but not as dangerous. The houses in this level vary in design and size, although there are reports of spotting two houses near each other that are the same.</p>\n\n<p>That's my first 3D game, so may have bugs in game!\u00a0Hope you enjoy! :)<br/></p>\r\nNOTE: Turn on your sound, it will help you to know when the entity is in the level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T13:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3be034d2d23e1989a383f1f6fe236af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kramitos321"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
