In 2015, developers abandoned the free-to-play model and now users must pay for the full version of the game. It is available on Steam and players can log in using it. After the release on the site, the developers refused to pay a subscription. Previously, it cost $ 10.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is as simple as possible - players compete for the number of frags in each match. There are scattered weapons, armour, first-aid kits and other power-ups on the map. As the user plays he discovers new tactics and movements, like rocket jumping and strafe. In total there are 12 modes in the game.</p>\n<p>There is no single campaign, the whole game is full-throttle multiplayer experience with fast-paced matches. The developers are betting on turning Quake Live into a major cybersport discipline and hold one of the biggest Quake tournaments at QuakeCon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:06:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb7/bb71799efe642c69f28c92c835a1257d.jpg", "website": "http://www.quakelive.com", "rating": 3.55, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 59, "owned": 2409, "beaten": 62, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 201, "playing": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 58, "ratings_count": 317, "suggestions_count": 562, "game_series_count": 8, "reviews_count": 317, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["id Software"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": null}
