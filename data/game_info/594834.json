You want to crash as hard as you can into the hills of trash. If you hit it fast enough, you'll clean up the trash and build your tower higher and higher. The higher the tower, the faster you fall and the deeper you can reach.</p>\n<p>That all being said, the gameplay is not *really* there. So, just look at this submission as more of an artistic piece, if you will.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>While you are on the barge:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Turn with the mouse. Jump with spacebar.</p>\n<p><strong>Mid air:</strong></p>\n<p>You have air control with WASD. Pressing W/S will have you tuck your body- try to make that swan wave look great for a boost of speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Underwater:</strong></p>\n<p>Move the mouse to look around. W/S will swim forward or backward depending on the angle you're looking at.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hit R at any time to reset- for debug purpose :)</strong><br/></p>\n\r\nPost Mortem\r\n<p><strong>What went wrong:</strong></p>\n<p>So, I didn't get to finish this time. We blew a day and a half trying to roll with a third party movement system and I ended up cramming in some jank home-made controller.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What went right:</strong></p>\n<p>I am actually overwhelmingly pleased with how the art turned out. I picked up a bunch of tricks, like how to use substance for lowrez art and get away with it, and how AMAZING Rigify is. I normally make my own rigs from scratch everytime, but I may never make a humanoid again- it's that good! I also learned a lot more about shaders (which I should probably stop spending so much time on in jams..)</p>\n<p><em>I think I will keep working on this...</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T11:10:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d59/d596fc083c0edce0b630dd4564fdfd88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SugarSores"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
