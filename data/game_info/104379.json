A dish-washing simulator. That's what it is, the <strong>Dish-washing Simulator 2014</strong>.</p>What can I do?<p>Unfortunately not much. You can start/stop the water and move the bowl around :P</p>Why is it so awful?<p>Well, this is the first time I participate alone in a game jam, first \"game\" using Unity, I hadn't made a 3d model before and lastly I started working on it today. But it would probably be the same even if I had a week :P</p>What did I use?<p>Unity3D / MonoDevelop (C#), and\u00a0Blender (I mainly use Adobe AIR for games, http://onegameamonth.com/dn0z)</p>Where can I find your other games?<p>Dish-washing Simulator 2014 is not even a game, but if you want check out my Ludum Dare profile (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/dinos/) and my website (http://www.icyhippo.com/) :D</p>Credits?<ul><li>Marble texture licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License (http://www.swtexture.com/2013/03/marble-textures-1.html)</li><li>Fridge texture licensed under Public Domain Dedication (http://all-free-download.com/free-photos/fridge_texture_210129.html)</li><li>Wood texture for non-commercial use (http://allroundnews.com/seamless-wood-textures-free-for-designers)</li><li>Tiles texture free to use, both commercial and non-commercial (http://seamless-pixels.blogspot.gr/2012/01/wall-tiles-texture.html)</li><li>Water sound loop licensed under the\u00a0Attribution License, from\u00a0freesound.org (author: templeofhades,\u00a0http://freesound.org/people/templeofhades/sounds/233406)</li><li>TTS voice generated via YAKiToMe!
