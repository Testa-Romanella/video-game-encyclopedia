The Olympic committee was\u00a0having a great time brain storming new event ideas, but were having trouble thinking of a\u00a0substitute for climbing - as of course in zero gravity climbing would be pretty easy, and which way is even up?! However, eventually they came up with this: Gravity Grappling - an exciting extreme endurance sport where you have to pull your way through incoming obstacles and get as far as you can. It seemed close enough to earth climbing because of the grappling hook and, well, the rocks but undeniably had an exciting twist to bring\u00a0spectators in from far and wide.</p>\n<p>Blast, pull and swing your way into a new highscore.<br/></p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Made in two days for the ScoreSpace #9 game jam. The top 3 people with\u00a0highest scores at the end of the jam will get their names here!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>While\u00a0I made all the artwork myself, the music is from Tallbeard Studios. They have some awesome stuff and you can check them out here.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I am using dreamlo for my leaderboard system, and while it is fantastic if anything goes wrong it is largely out of my control. However, your highscore will still be saved locally.</p>\n<p>---</p><p>Use WSAD or arrow keys to move, mb1 to shoot and mb2 to grapple.\u00a0</p><p>---</p>\n<p>You can either download the Gravity Grapple installer or the zip file. Both contain the same stuff, it just depends what you prefer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T06:55:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d567a1b2a436d01e6764e54ccfe0eb59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Wzd"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
