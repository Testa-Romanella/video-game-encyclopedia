{"id": 767636, "slug": "enhanced-itch-martinjimbobbrockett", "name": "Enhanced (itch) (MartinJimbobBrockett)", "name_original": "Enhanced (itch) (MartinJimbobBrockett)", "description": "<p>The Enhanced are here, but so are the failed duplicates! Take them down before they can take you down! <br/></p>\n<p>Enhanced is a fantasy maze crawler, focusing on the 4 beings who have come together to form the team known as The Enhanced. Using these 4 as your playable party, you must traverse randomised mazes, facing evil versions of your own party. At the end of each level, a themed boss will stand between you and the next area, and they will not make it easy for you to get passed!</p>\n<p>All enemies will drop coins, which can be spent on your party. You can use them to heal your team members back up to a good amount HP, go beyond their starting HP values and upgrade them up to a maximum of 999HP, or buy new unique weapon upgrades for each character. Spend your coins wisely, and use your upgrades to take down even more enemies!</p>\n<p>In each level there is a hidden item - a book - that you can attempt to find. It will be randomly placed within the maze, so you may have to spend extra time looking for it and risk getting lost! Each levels book will unlock a different piece of lore for you to read, giving you more information on the background of the world, what caused the enemies to arise in the first place, and even how to better use your party!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you can get a party together, you and some friends can enjoy playing together as members of The Enhanced in the 4 different multiplayer modes:</p>\n<p>- Coin Battle - Inside a maze, you and 3 friends battle it out to claim the highest number of coins! Coins will randomly spawn within the maze, finding them will add to your personal total. You can take out other players to steal their coins and send them back to where they came from! The battle only lasts 3 minutes, so try and take as many coins as you can as quickly as you can!</p>\n<p>- Arena Mode - In an arena once used by evil creatures to try and trap and defeat The Enhanced, the 4 now come together to face each other! You and 3 friends must face each other in a free-for-all match, where the last one alive will reign victorious! Just don't be too mad if you get ganged up on!</p>\n<p>- Maze Race - This one is for settling one-on-one debates. You and a friend are given the same maze, and must race to see who can get to the end first. No speed differences this time, no weapons, no enemies, just running through a maze to see who can get to the end first. The winner earns bragging rights for the week!</p>\n<p>- Co-op Boss Rush - You've faced each other enough, now you must work together. Remember the bosses you were taking down one by one alone? They're back, and ready to destroy The Enhanced! Using just the characters lowest tier weapons, you and 3 friends must work together to take down all the bosses that you've seen in the single-player mode, as well as a new face. Evelyn, the elf scientist who departed from the magical ways of her own kind, has joined the list of enemies to face for this round. She will be exceptionally difficult to face, but will be worth it. If your team can take her down, all players involved will have their local coin total raised to the maximum of 999! As well as this, any players that survived will have their entire local party's HP all raised to the maximum of 999HP! Can you work together to take down this foe? How many of you will survive to earn this ultimate reward? Gather 3 teammates and find out together!</p>\n<p>With this much going on, Enhanced is sure to keep you busy for a while. What will you do first? Rush to take down all the bosses? Take your time and gather coins to buy the upgrades? Perhaps your first mission will be gathering 3 friends to take down Evelyn? Whichever you choose, you are sure to have a great time as The Enhanced, taking down tough bosses and traversing through mazes that are different every time you enter them. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNINGS:</strong></p>\n<p>- This game can get difficult quite quickly, so frustration is possible. If you are feeling frustrated at this game, be sure to take a break from it and try again later. If something isn't working out for you, try a different approach.</p>\n<p>- The multiplayer mode for this game runs on Steam servers. Instructions for getting the multiplayer to work are in the game, inside the multiplayer menu. What is not mentioned here is that for multiple multiplayer sessions, the game must be closed and re-opened before choosing another multiplayer mode. This issue is being looked into, as I know it can be inconvenient. <br/></p>\n<p>- I am not an artist, so not all of the graphics will be 100% perfect, please forgive me, I tried my best.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Aiming - the characters aim at the cursor</p>\n<p>Use weapon - the left mouse click\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pause - P (multiplayer modes cannot be paused)<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>MULTIPLAYER INSTRUCTIONS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>These are in the multiplayer menu as well, but I have placed them here in case you wish to delve straight into the multiplayer action with your friends! <br/></p>\n\n<p>1) Have a Steam account.</p>\n<p>2) Open Steam, then add Enhanced as a non-steam game.</p>\n<p>3) Run Enhanced through Steam.</p>\n<p>4) Make sure you there are either 2 or 4 players in total.</p>\n<p>5) Have fun with your friends!</p>\n\n<p><strong>OTHER NOTES FROM THE DEVELOPER:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Enhanced has been solo-developed by MartinJimbobBrockett, but I could not have done it without help from many people. My uni lecturers who taught me the basics of making a game both in a team and solo, the friends who told me how proud they are of me and my work, the family that lent me their laptops so I could test the multiplayer modes, and you. The person reading this, whether you choose to get this game or not, you are part of the reason I made this. While yes, I have learned a lot (especially developing it alone), and I can add this to portfolios and such, the main reason I made this was because I want to make something others can enjoy. I wanted to make games so that other people could enjoy something I was a part of, and if you enjoy this game, that will make me exceptionally happy. Even if you enjoy trying to break every single piece of the game and find as many problems with it as possible, that will still mean you enjoyed it, and for that, I am glad. If you wish to leave any reviews, I will read every single one, and if you'd like to DM me about this game or anything else I do/have done, you can find me in several places here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing my game! I hope you enjoyed it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T01:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d94/d94d8da3fa20396e3b697bb247bf21a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MartinJimbobBrockett"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
