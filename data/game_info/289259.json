The rule of this game is similar to sewing clothes.If this line is on the front, the next line will be on the reverse side. When encountering an obstacle, the spider will not be able to pass, so avoid obstacles on the same side as the line. (The huge button is the obstacle that exists on both sides.) The game currently has 5 levels in total. Players can challenge the previous level to unlock the next level.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:55:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/597e771fe28436f3266bdf15978bdb1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anlideer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
