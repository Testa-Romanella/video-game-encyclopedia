Follow Averix and his fellow hero's on a journey that takes place once every 300 years to defeat the mysterious entity known as the Archon. Journey through 4 continents, each with side quests, friends, enemies, and story and character building events. This game is still in development, as are the other 2 games in this series. This game is the 2nd game in the series, but the first to be release/be in early access and will be followed by the 3rd game Tales of Eden, and then lastly the prequel game War of Ancients. Gameplay will be the classic jrpg formula, turn based battle system, boss battles(reoccuring and new bosses.), monster battle arena in development, airship feature available after side quest completion. I have been developing the story for these 3 games since i started playing jrpgs when i was a kid and has been my dream to get this out there to people. I hope you enjoy it as much as i had making it and playing it too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls: Talk/accept battle command- Enter/C/Space bar<br/>Cancel battle command/exit/open menu - X</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d9/5d963687ab4973cddc391b346131ffea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DavidChampion"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
