I honestly didn't put much effort into this, but I did add some sound effects and it is replay able. The asteroids do glitch every now and then, and the player isn't centered, but I'd say it's a decent recreation and it was mainly made for educational purposes,\u00a0so just have fun!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10a354adb5ef40b6e24e45251aaba3b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Techno Cuber"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
