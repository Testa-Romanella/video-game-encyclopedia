On your way to retrieve them you encounter puzzles and traps powered by the very same technology Alset invented.</p>\n<p>A normal playthrough of this prototype can range from 10 to 15 minutes, but the game is also meant to be speedrun-friendly; responsive controls, no RNG, and a lot of shortcuts. This can cut down the time to less than 2 minutes. (Or maybe even less.)</p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong><br/>An Xbox controller is recommended to play this game, and we can't guarantee reliable input if you use some other device.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Development<br/></strong>We are six students from the University of Sk\u00f6vde, and this prototype was developed in our spare time during eight weeks. The game recieved a nomination for the category \"Best Excecution in Audio\" for the Swedish Game Awards.\u00a0<br/>The development process can be watched here:<br/></p>\n<strong>Crew<br/></strong>Adam Wallberg - Director, Programmer, Designer, Composer, Artist<br/>Sanna Ylv\u00e9n - Producer, Designer, Artist<br/>Carl Sj\u00f6lander - 3D Artist<br/>David Stenfors - Animator<br/>Angelica Holst - Texture &amp; 2D Artist<br/>Felix Gr\u00f6nvall - Design &amp; QA", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6ad1425e361e46907da9b252b389fed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Adam W"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
