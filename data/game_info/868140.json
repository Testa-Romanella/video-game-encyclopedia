Choose your hero and explore randomly generated card dungeons, gather powerful artifacts to get new abilities, and fight against increasingly mighty enemies! Will you make it to level 50?<br/><br/> <h3>ROGUELIKE GAMEPLAY</h3>Each dungeon is randomly generated, so each game is unique! But randomness ends there, as all needed information is shown in-game. Your destiny is determined by your decisions!<h3>EACH DECISION MATTERS</h3>On each turn, the only decision you can make is to go right or down. This decision, which at first seems trivial, hides a great tactical depth. Will you try to dodge that high-level monster or fight it to get the artifact it hides to its right? The new artifact you just got gives you 5 coins every turn, but only if you move down. Will you risk it?<h3>UNLOCKABLE ARTIFACTS, HEROES AND DUNGEONS</h3><ul><li>Unlock 6 heroes with different starting artifacts and skills to create your custom run!<br/></li><li>More than 100 artifacts with a wide variety of effects that you can unlock with every game you play!<br/></li><li>9 different dungeons.
