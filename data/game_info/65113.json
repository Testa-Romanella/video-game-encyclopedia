It's time to eat or die trying.Welcome to the first, best, and only casual 3D claymation snakelike. Take control of a fast-growing serpent and feast on everything in sight (except things that explode of course). And don't run into your own wriggling tail. This is a game about eating from the maker of Retrobooster. Some game modes are about fast eating, while others are about strategic eating. In fact, Velocidevorium is pseudo-Latin for \"a place of swift devouring.\"Features<ul><li> Eating<br/></li><li> Vomiting<br/></li><li> Game controller support<br/></li><li> Multiple mini-games<br/></li><li> Split-screen combat modes<br/></li><li> A multitude of unlockable levels<br/></li><li> More eating<br/></li><li> Extremely procedural levels (they morph continuously)<br/></li><li> Ice cream!</li></ul>Procedural blah blah blahYou have heard all the usual chatter about procedural levels, but this game is different. Instead of generating a level and then tossing you into it, Velocidevorium's levels change every frame. The surface you are playing on constantly transforms. Watch the trailer closely and you'll get the idea.Art styleStop-frame animation all the way! This world is made mostly out of clay, but you'll find other knick-knacks here too.
