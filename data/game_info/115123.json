Locals say that mansion is a rotten place and usually try to avoid it. Do they have reasons or that's just some sort of a local legend? Time will show.<br/>But first she has to meet the other four maids working there already.<br/><br/>Dev Team<br/>Dark Sentinel - initial idea, code, writing, art<br/>Leery - development support, ideas, discussion, testing<br/>Odebe - original soundtrack - link<br/></p><p>Help from outside the dev team:<br/>Mansion background (in modified state though) by mugenjohncel<br/>Zelan - proofreading and editing</p><p>Other<br/>Lint statistics: The game contains 1,891 dialogue blocks, containing 14,383 words.<br/>That's pretty much everything. Done in 20 days. Since it's my first attempt in making a VN, feature creep was a problem, so I had to throw away large chunks of logic, text and features to make it done within deadline.<br/>[spoiler]Next novel, if I ever make, should be much less trouble.[/spoiler]<br/>The sprites are okay (I'm happy with them), though Chikuma is almost emotionless.<br/>Backgrounds are worse, some of them were made in great hurry and I had to use one BG from the free assets.<br/>Didn't have enough time to work on UI at all.<br/>Could be worse, though. As somebody said - the goal of Nano is \"done\", not \"pretty\".<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and make sure to check other NaNoRenO '16 entries!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aee/aeeaf54ede267d3bc58966b53a03e6ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dark_Sentinel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
