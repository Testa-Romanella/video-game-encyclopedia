I don't plan for there to be\u00a0a future for CluttR any time soon but I may come back to re-making CluttR once I have learnt a lot more.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD / Arrow keys</p>\n<p>Shooting: Left-Click</p>\n<p>Respawn: Left-Click</p>\n<p>Hide Timer: T <br/>(Your final time will be shown on death.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T12:52:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed0/ed019fe217ccc0c07a83ca42f9af5cec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lyim"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
