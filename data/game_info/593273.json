You go to the indicated place and discover a painting gallery like no other...<br/>Indeed, your challenge is to gather <strong>more than 200 paintings by solving puzzles!</strong><br/><br/>In <strong>A Mysterious Gallery</strong> you have to get paintings by solving three kinds of puzzles.<br/><br/>Most of the puzzles are inspired by <strong>hidden object</strong> games. Indeed, some paintings have a problem: <strong>an element has been erased</strong>. It's up to you to identify that element. For example:<br/> Pretty easy to guess what's missing! It's often less obvious. But <strong>there are always clues</strong>, just observe the painting carefully (position of the characters, pattern...).<br/>Then, you have to find that element, because <strong>it is hidden among all the other paintings</strong>.<br/><br/>Then there are riddles with a <strong>code to find</strong>. The numbers or letters of the code are placed in the paintings. <strong>But they are invisible!</strong> You have to use a special object, the revealing magnifying glass. Its flash makes them appear.<br/>Fortunately there are always <strong>clues</strong> to know in which paintings and in which places the numbers and letters are hidden.<br/><br/><br/>Finally, there are <strong>more classic</strong> puzzles requiring action, memory, observation...<br/><br/>When a puzzle is solved, the paintings associated with that puzzle are added to the gallery and <strong>can be viewed freely</strong>.
