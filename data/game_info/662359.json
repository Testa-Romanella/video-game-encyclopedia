You wake up in a seemingly abandoned college building with no recollection of your past. To your horror you soon find yourself trapped here where all students and even the teachers seem hell bent on making your life a living hell with seemingly no reason.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is no exploration and the story must be observed through questioning your enemies in the heat of battle and calling what few friends you make from the solace of a safe hiding place in between fights. You start the game under powered and must build up your skills and repertoire of moves to at first just survive against the myriad of vicious and aggressive predominantly female foes you encounter throughout the school.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T02:37:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d23/d2376174a7dde498eb57e50cc4cad138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jackSTAR"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["jackSTAR"], "esrb_rating": null}
