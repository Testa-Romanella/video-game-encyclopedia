The visual guide will tell you where the ball will go, but there is no telling where it will bounce from there.</p>Features<ul><li>8 levels, featuring obstacles such as mountains, sand traps, and the ocean. That's almost half a golf course!</li><li>A unified control scheme that makes golfing a breeze! Don't worry about putting, just <strong>Chip It In!</strong></li><li>Play loose and fast with the \"rules\" of Golf. Hit your ball before it stops rolling. Hit it before it even lands!</li><li>Make a bad shot? Just Mulligan it until you get things to go just right!</li></ul>Hints<ul><li>Is there a mountain in your way? Just hit the ball over it, no problem! Or even better, use it as a ramp!</li><li>Not driving the ball far enough? Try hitting it at a lower angle! It can help it bounce a lot farther!</li><li>Is your ball bouncing out of control? Next time, try aiming for the bunker! It's counter-intuitive, but it works!</li><li>Is the ball rolling in the wrong direction? Just hit it in the opposite direction! We're not strict about rules around here.</li></ul><p>The music in this game (Easy Lemon, Summer Day, Windswept) was made by Kevin Macleod (incompetech.com).
