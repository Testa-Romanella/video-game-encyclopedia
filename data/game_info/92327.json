Infused with feelings about time passing faster the older you get. <br/> <br/>A top down action RPG where you age over time instead of level. Ageing happens faster the older you are. Age affects your stats, first for the better, and then... <br/> <br/>Two button controls, left click moves you around, right click interacts with certain things and targets enemies. <br/> <br/>Your life is scored at the end, and your accomplishments logged, was it all worthwhile? <br/> <br/>Have fun! <br/> <br/>(PS. There's also a dragon.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/815653c10e96c0d81382e826122fcc00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShaunJS"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
