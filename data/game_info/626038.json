Recently they found a potential source and it's up to you to investigate this in the local outskirts of your city. However, these area's are filled with the brim with criminal activity, not to mention the paranormal dangers themselves. The protagonist will be able to get weapons to defend himself with, but the paranormal influence left his physical abilities weak (thankfully not his endurance), but it also brought the side effect in that he gets help from another dimension, you! As long the protagonist has the energy, you can move various objects you find in order to create new paths for him or give your enemies a surprise. You'll be needing it since the protagonist won't be able to brute force anything. Especially since weapons don't last very long, you however, do.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made as part of an exam of my first year of game dev lessons, and is my first actual game made. Obviously, there are some rough edges, it's however completely playable to the end! Don't be afraid of feedback, there's a good possibility I'll polish this little game more in the future.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD/ZQSD: move left and right<br/>E: switch to equipped mellee weapon<br/>R: switch to equipped ranged weapon<br/>Space: jump<br/>Lshift: toggle movemode, while in movemode you can click and drag objects.<br/>Left-click: attack, select weapon, drag objects, use item.<br/>Right-click: when you have a gun equipped, click and hold to aim in front of you.<br/>Escape: Pause the game and open the main menu, in-game you can retry from the latest checkpoint here if you feel you're stuck.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T05:29:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dc2664957716f5c1b5ea6dd8903cbdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vanille987"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
