Made it mostly with RPG Maker MZ assets and a few extra things like some Google Images sprites and a plug-in (created in the game itself). The game is based on the Catholic understanding of angels and Heaven and the war that knocked Satan out of Heaven. If you're not Christian, please don't let that stop you from playing. I simply found what inspired me and made a game about it. Also, forgive the dialogue in the game, I'm definitely not a writer. Takes me about 3 hours to beat. Hope you like it!<br/><br/>*Extra note: To all the creative types, do that project and share it! Don't care about who doesn't like it, share it for the 1 person who will.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T09:25:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e6/2e64a18b356a4c9473ad5882b8bc9adc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adambombdiggidy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
