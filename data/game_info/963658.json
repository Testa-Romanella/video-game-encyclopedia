Many years later, in the university town area of northern Huaxia, an underground shelter was opened, and you were ordered to repair the information cable damaged by the nuclear bomb. The first time I stepped on the wasteland of Huaxia, this scorched land was filled with unknown dangers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn \"Waste Land Huaxia\", there are abundant firearms and local \"garbage\" for you to collect. Not only can you wield knives and slash at enemies on the battlefield, pour your ammunition, but you can also disassemble and synthesize new props to become a bloodthirsty collector.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game provides players with four career plans, allowing you to go further and further on the evil path of self indulgence or striving for strength. These include: brainless and bloodthirsty commandos, eloquent salespeople, sneaky spies, and scientists with strong hands-on abilities (there is also a hidden profession that you slowly discover without fear of challenges... Tip: Learn? It\u2019s bullshit\uff01).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdditionally, in your adventurous career, you may encounter characters that make you feel a bit excited.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDisadvantage: Due to limitations in software development, it is not possible to replace the magazine during battles, and you are never required to replace the magazine during battles. In addition, the game is really Pixel art style, because RPGmakerVA has no choice, and the number of animation frames is small. Due to being developed by one person in their spare time, it is inevitable that there will be a lot of unsatisfactory BUUUUGs. Please understand in advance and notify me of any modifications in a timely manner.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFurthermore, why do the people in 'Waste Land Huaxia' dress in the style of the 1980s? The history of this world is slightly different from our existing world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T03:59:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61d/61dc699047097b6dfcd6eafc5225abe2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u5228\u51b0\u56e2\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5228\u51b0\u56e2\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
