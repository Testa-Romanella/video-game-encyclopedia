A vile conglomerate of oligarchs lord over the fractured territories of the Americas from a floating fortress-city known as KAPITAL. This de facto cartel-state maintains control over the continental populace via KAPITAL OPERATIVES, brutal thugs more commonly known as KOPs. A paramilitary force composed of die-hard loyalists and brainwashed warriors, the KOPs carry out KAPITAL\u2019s bidding while keeping the street gangs and ethno-nationalist warbands tightly under their thumb. They call this violence THE LAW.<br/><br/>In KOP KILLER 22XX you are the KOP KILLER, a humble miner turned CYBORG KILLING MACHINE from the toxic pit-town called Acuaverde. A feud among KAPITAL houses renders the digital scrip you\u2019re paid in utterly worthless. To afford the anti-rad meds needed to survive Acuaverde, you and your fellow workers turn to a life of CRIME! <br/><br/>Arrested and sold to the highest bidder, you\u2019re sent to Homan Correction, a hellish prison known for human experimentation. The overseers select YOU for the WARRIOR program, where they intend to hack away at your mind and body to transform you into an obedient KAPITAL OPERATIVE. A mysterious accident interrupts the process before they take control of your mind, unleashing you on the Prison to dole out your own brand of JUSTICE.<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Experience white-knuckle arcade action in procedural generated arenas.<br/></li><li>Battle over a dozen AI enemy-types that jump, climb, and fly to hunt you down.<br/></li><li>Collect loads of power-ups to customize your build as you advance.<br/></li><li>Recruit AI comrades with unique abilities to join your fight against KAPITAL<br/></li><li>Compete globally and with your friends on Steam Leaderboards.<br/></li><li>Complete achievements to unlock new content.<br/></li><li>Manage health and ammo through combat choices as you struggle for survival.<br/></li><li>Play using your favorite controller.<br/></li><li>Enjoy bashing fascist goons with cyborg fists of steel.</li></ul><h3>EARLY ACCESS ROADMAP</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T05:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/643/6435bcdc004147ebf72e94529d0d9858.jpg", "website": "https://www.morningstargamestudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 313, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Morningstar Game Studio", "Dr. Shameless Cat Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Morningstar Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
