Each character represents a video game category, minus the twin game streamers. There's a move where a character who represents simulation games changes it depending on the time of day it is. There are specials such as using a part of a claw machine to help you catch yourself while you control the claw. Then there's the twin streamers, who can livestream one attack from wherever they left their laptop at. The game features seven playable characters and a varied soundtrack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeatures<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2022 Single Player<br/>\r\n\u2022 Arcade Mode - Against a series of opponents<br/>\r\n\u2022 Quick Match Mode", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T04:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c10/c102a0c0bb56f4102c5533a8e9d8a732.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jareed Dempsey"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Jareed Dempsey"], "esrb_rating": null}
