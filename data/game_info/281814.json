Beware: time matters! Levels are flooding so you won\u2019t have too much time to spare. But remember, if you really want to master this game, no bonus should be left behind. <br/><br/>Designed to fit your mobile phone as well as your iPad, this game will run even on old devices (with at least firmware 3.13). <br/><br/>Two different control kinds are available: a normal on-screen directional pad (that you can put on the left or on the right of the screen), or a swipe control (swipe to move, tap to stop, so you won\u2019t need to take your finger pressed on your device all the time). <br/>User interaction is kept as simple as possible: actions (using terminals, opening doors, calling lifts) are done simply going in the direction of the items, so all you have to worry about is just to move your digital alter ego with speed, precision and, of course, the right timing.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/443/443ce0c5a39f354386d08226dbedde49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Marco Giorgini"], "esrb_rating": null}
