Fast paced game with elements from famous top down pixel art games.</p>\n<p>I made this game for GameDev.tv gamejam as my personal challenge. I wanted to prove myself that I'm able to finish one simple game in less than a month and totally alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Big and main thanks belongs to my girlfriend who helped me with this idea and also my all stream supporters and my friends who trust in me!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would like to ask you all to try this simple game and give me as much feedback as you can because I would like to publish this game on mobile platforms as well but main challenge is coming right now. I need to polish and fix all the major issues and add more content such as more food types, animate more animals and add online scoreboard for you to compete in!</p>\n<p>Before hating my game, consider liking it! It's just fun and I\u00a0made it for you!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is not finished game yet. You can go through levels but there are still a lot of things upcoming in further releases. I need to balance food spawn in respective percentage according to animals etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please consider providing me as much detailed feedback. I will really appreciate that. :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:34:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a99/a991f406160a06b4064e875920fad65b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoxApo Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
