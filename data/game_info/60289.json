In the universe the game is located in, gulls just pop-up with each level-change.<br/>\r\nYou, the player of the game, are supposed to get their numbers down by using advanced weaponry.<br/>\r\nThe game can be sustained for unbounded periods of time. The goal of the game is to shoot gulls.<br/>\r\nYou can shoot a lot, or you can shoot a few, it does not really matter. They keep re-spawning anyway with each level change.<br/>\r\nThe game lacks any form of moral. It is an unfair struggle between you and those gulls.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour weapons have been modified to accommodate arcade mode. That means no running out of bullets and thus no reloading.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bddc6af2f3d05454b0763b5d80aa0ccb.jpg", "website": "https://www.wosabi.com/index.php/Gull_Kebap_VR", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wosabi"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["wosabi"], "esrb_rating": null}
