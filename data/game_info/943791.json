This is our submission  to our first ever game jam\u00a0the Godot Wild Jam #55.\u00a0The theme was <strong>DREAMS.<br/><br/></strong>We really enjoyed our first game jam ever as a team, it was really fun and enjoyable to see the team finally get together and actually make something for once. We would also recommend any small indie devs to participate in small jams like these to properly develop any game design skills that they have.<br/><br/>Finding an idea for a theme is endless and out of context was surprisingly alot more difficult than we initially thought. We spent the entire first day of the jam release day just brainstorming on ideas and concepts on what we could create. The idea that struct us the most however was the deciding factor for what we would soon to become this. \"A game where you work as a security guard in a hotel that has the ability to see people's dreams and alter them using the power of music.\" It was just perfect!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately however, we won't able to add every single feature that we had originally planned to add into the game, which was expected ofc, but we still decided to submit what we currently had on the board anyways.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WE\u00a0ARE ALSO LISTENING TO ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE COULD EXPAND THIS CONCEPT!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T05:20:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d3/1d3f4cdd0ba2de4ab45e497095f817d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brain Glue Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
