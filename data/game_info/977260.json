{"id": 977260, "slug": "fantasy-adventure-builder", "name": "Fantasy Adventure Builder", "name_original": "Fantasy Adventure Builder", "description": "<strong>Fantasy Adventure Builder (TM)</strong> is the digital version of the famous book \u201c<strong>Tome of Adventure Design</strong>\u201d. It contains hundreds of tables that help you come up with ideas for quests, adventurers, monsters, and anything related to High Fantasy TT RPGs.<br/><br/>In addition, it features the Table Designer tool with which you can create your own generators and use them in your games as you play, either online or around the table. No coding is needed, so get ready to bring your ideas to life.<h3>Tome of Adventure Design - Fantasy Adventure Builder</h3><br/><br/>The Adventure Design Tool lets you generate results from the Tome of Adventure Design with a single click of the mouse, and browse through multiple table-results all at once. Sub-tables are rolled and displayed automatically.<br/><br/>In addition, you are allowed to reroll the whole results, certain results but also even partially reroll certain words until you get exactly what you were looking for.<br/>A vast list of tables awaits you to generate anything you like, and all of them are written by award-winning author Matt Finch and Mythmere games.<h3>The Notebook &amp; Exports</h3><br/><br/>You will be able to use the Adventure Design Tool interactively, generating results from several linked tables all at once. As you work you are allowed to keep results to your \u201cNotebook\u201d.<br/><br/>In the Notebook, you are allowed to further edit your results and when ready you can export in txt or PDF.<h3>Create Your Own Generators</h3><br/><br/>The Table Designer Tool lets you create your own generators for anything you can imagine, such as encounter tables, NPCs, and name-generators, but also super complex ones.<br/><br/>We provide you with an easy-to-use tool but if you are familiar with html you can go that way as well.<br/><br/>-You can copy-paste from an Excel or CSV.<br/>-You can use any AI Chat to paste results to your tables.<br/>-You can save your Generators and use them later on in your games.<br/>-You can share your generators through Steam Workshop.<h3>The Tutorial</h3><br/><br/>Although Fantasy Adventure Builder is easy to use, we provide you with a full tutorial video which you can watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ2qf3qaARA&amp;t=3s<br/><br/>Although no code is needed to create your generators and all functionalities work with UI Buttons, we allow you to use HTML and our own pseudo-language as you type. You can find all the commands in the app\u2019s menu.<h3>Premium DLC</h3><br/><br/>We will be adding premium downloadable content to the \"My Generators\" section as we go. This premium DLC will include a generator for the history of magical items written by <strong>Matt Finch</strong>, and other tables not included in the <strong>Tome of Adventure Design</strong>. Other table writers will also be contributing to this set of tables and generators.<h3>Commercial License</h3><br/><br/>If you plan to use the software on a monetized YouTube channel or show raw output on a monetized blog, you'll need to get the commercial use license. Feel free to contact Brave Alice Games.<br/><br/>Most people don't need a commercial license; you <strong>DON'T</strong> need it for making adventures for use at your own gaming table. Even publishing your adventure for money, as long as it doesn't contain text taken directly from the tables, is also perfectly fine. Using the software on a non-monetized YouTube channel is permitted (even with images of the user interface).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T04:19:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/1168b39a06d3a890627f9b49e6c048e8.jpg", "website": "https://www.bravealice.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Brave Alice Games", "Mythmere Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Brave Alice Games", "Mythmere Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
