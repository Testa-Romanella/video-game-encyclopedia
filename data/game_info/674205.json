Powerful weapons are available since the very beginning with more and more of them becoming available as the story progresses. 'Netherprime' can be collected from opponents defeated to enhance the various aspects of the prototype 'Netherpiercer' spaceship, allowing for greatly varied upgrades experimentation after every single boss vanquished. Netherspace features random enemy swarm formation making every single playthrough different than the last one.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T02:32:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bb4dea84c381946ee3b52867a3eb89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Konstantinos Dimitriou Katsoris"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Konstantinos Dimitriou Katsoris"], "esrb_rating": null}
