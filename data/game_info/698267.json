You got dragged into this dump for 'misconduct', but you remember nothing... <strong>THEY </strong>have been depriving you of food for what seems an eternity. Why would they keep you down here?<br/></p>\n<p>The organization behind your entrapment is getting complacent. They start visiting your cell frequently. You see a way out. You make sure to look weak when the sadistic guard comes in for your daily beating. Waiting for the right day, the right moment, you pounce.\r\n</p>\n<p>- \"I am the Juggernaut, bi*ch\"</p>\n<p>Now you must escape!</p>\n<p><strong>____________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0You have 60 seconds to escape the prison before reinforcements come your way.<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Heavily focus on your movement ability (WASD), and quick reaction times for attacking (LMB).
