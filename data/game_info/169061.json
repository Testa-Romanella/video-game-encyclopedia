Mean Shapes!<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Avoid cruel shapes to the beat of the music. The light beams harm you, the dark beams help you; The more light beams you get, the worse it is!! If you place your beams wisely and collect those upgrades, you may just stand a chance!<br/><br/>UPDATE: In the next few weeks, I will create an improved version of 'Shapes Are Mean' incorporating the suggestions I got from the Ludum Dare Game Jam. Look out for\"Shapes Are Mean Version 2.0\" !!! Shapes Are Mean will not be available to download in the meantime. <br/><br/>Ludum Dare Event Page:\u00a0 https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/shapes-are-mean<br/><br/>UPDATED VERSION (11 Dec 2017) - I (think I have) fixed an issue in which the game wasn't displaying on certain pcs. People can also now press 'Esc' to leave the 'thank you' screen prematurely. <br/>As per the rules of Ludum Dare, no new features were added, and no changes whatsoever were made to alter the original gameplay. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a8/2a865f1ac1f89d42ea743d0750dd582a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlakeMcDeezy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
