Mouse Wheel - Zoom in and out of the game</p>\n<p>2. WASD/Arrow Keys - Move the Camera Around</p>\n<p>This is one of my long-term projects to which I intend to add a great many things, but for now, here are the present features:</p>\n<p>1. The possibility to generate a square map of customizable size</p>\n<p>2. 2 pre-built maps - one of Europe and the Mediterranean, and one of a set of islands</p>\n<p>3. The ability to add Custom Civilizations(with their own color and naming), which can spawn in the game.</p>\n<p>4. The ability to add Custom Maps, by converting any PNG or JPG image to green, yellow and blue.</p>\n<p>5. Civilizations expanding into unclaimed territory, and attacking each other</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>I have a great many things planned, so the game in its current state is very much WIP.\u00a0</p>\n<p>______________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>If you especially enjoyed\u00a0<strong>VVV</strong>,\u00a0 consider supporting me on Patreon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T10:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5a/b5a759794ae325c473111e8aabcb28ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MysteriousDeveloper"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
