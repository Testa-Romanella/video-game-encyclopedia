If you can see it, you can smash it.<br/></li><li><strong>Create new structures</strong> on the battlefield: build your own bridges and barricades; freeze water to form ice bridges; set traps for enemies to wander into; place explosives to detonate at an opportune moment.<br/></li><li><strong>Defensive terrain</strong>: take up position in <strong>tall grass</strong> to gain a defense boost--or hack it down to deny that same advantage to the enemy.<br/></li><li><strong>Extreme turn flexibility</strong>: move a character, move a second character, then return to finish the first character's turn.
