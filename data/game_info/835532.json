In the calm of the night.</p>\n\r\nPhysics-based calculations\r\n<p>The special thing about the game is that the interactions with the road are made using physics : the ship is equipped with four gravity thrusters that push up the ship when near the floor.</p>\n<p>As such, the game can play differently based on the FPS you get while playing, and some interactions may seem unrealistic due to some calculations error that can take place inside the engine.</p>\n<p>I could not test out the game on low hardware, though the game should not be too demanding since the graphics are based on the PSX framework, emulating PS1 graphics.</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Enjoy an handmade city with retro graphics.</li><li>Race against the clock on three designed races.</li><li>Enjoy the freedom and hunt for generated checkpoints accross the city.</li><li>Customize your ride with your favorite paintjob !</li></ul>\n\n\r\nHow to play\r\n\n<p>As for AZERTY users... Do not worry ! It is supported out of the box ;)</p>\r\nClosing words\r\n<p>7 months ago, I set out on this project thinking it would only take me 3 months to complete... Though I'm really happy with out it came out !<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy speeding through the city ! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T08:29:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/016/016f4339d109c77a2153aec01331e375.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 364, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Fast Extract Games"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
