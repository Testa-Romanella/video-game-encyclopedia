Thugs, traps or clues left by the gods are examples of the work done to enrich the dynamics of the game. <br/>\r\nMissions in an open environment; <br/>\r\nintricate dungeons; <br/>\r\ntimed missions;<br/>\r\nall-out battles.<br/>\r\n As expected from Gilgamesh, the player is blessed with an enormous strenght, that makes possible run and swing fast, climb walls, jump far  etc.. The armor can be removed or equiped without open the inventory and is the same for four weapons(2 left, 2 right). So is possible, and sometimes very usefull, to combine different weapons attacks and dynamically adapt to your opponent fighting style. <br/>\r\nObjects like rocks or barrels can be throwed against enemies or obstacles.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-22T10:26:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/440/4408ac4ac917f994a2553245de82e0a1.jpg", "website": "http://www.firstherogame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 527, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Koala Medialab"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Koala Medialab"], "esrb_rating": null}
