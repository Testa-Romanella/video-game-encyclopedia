I've been working on this for a lot longer than I planned and the end product is probably shorter than you expect but I hope you have fun playing it. This project was mostly a way for me to learn Unreal and the\u00a0PS1 aesthetic so look forward to what I'll be putting together in the future.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PC Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: WASD<br/>Camera: Mouse<br/>Aim: Right Mouse Button<br/>Fire: Left Mouse Button<br/>Secondary Fire: Middle Mouse Button<br/>Stasis: Q<br/>Inventory: TAB<br/>Use Health Pack: Space<br/>Interact: F<br/>Reload: R<br/>Menu: Escape</p>\n<p><strong>Gamepad Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Movement: Left Analog Stick<br/>Camera: Right Analog Stick<br/>Aim: Left Trigger<br/>Fire: Right Trigger<br/>Secondary Fire: Right Shoulder Button<br/>Stasis: Left Face Button (While aiming)<br/>Inventory: Top Face Button<br/>Use Health Pack: Left Face Button (When not aiming)<br/>Interact: Bottom Face Button (When not aiming)<br/>Reload: Bottom Face Button (While Aiming)<br/>Menu: Start</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T17:59:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4d/b4deb635b431fac64c7387101239a198.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fraser Brumley"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
