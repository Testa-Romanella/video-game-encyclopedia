I only published it because I wanted to showcase the core game-play (i.e. making stuff). Lots of updates will be coming up within the next few months.<br/></p><p>A building game where you can make four different types of objects, color them however you want, and add whatever texture you can draw on a 720 by 720 size square.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Tab to activate Inventory Mode</p>\n<p>ESC to pause game<br/></p>\n<p>Left click to place something (object, color or texture), right click to take it away. For objects, you will need to press the one, two, three or four keys to activate each object before you can place it down.<br/></p>\n<p>When placing an object, you can rotate the object with the arrow keys, press and hold shift to snap rotation to a 45 degree angle, and reset rotation with the number one key. Use the mouse scroll wheel to bring the object closer/further away.</p>\n<p>When picking a color or drawing a texture, you can save the color/texture by left clicking on any button in the right scroll area of\u00a0 that tab, and right click to apply it to the color preview/draw space. Whatever is on that preview/draw space will be what you color objects with when you press \"Pick Color\"/\"Use Texture\".</p>\n<p>You can increase/decrease the brush size in the texture tab with the +/-buttons.</p>\n<p>Have fun!
