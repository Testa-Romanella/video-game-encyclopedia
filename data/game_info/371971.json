All players use different parts of the same keyboard as their controls:\u00a0P1 uses the arrow keys and ctrl, P2 uses QWASD, P3 uses UIJKL, and P4 uses RTFGH. An extra USB keyboard may be helpful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This\u00a0was my first ever foray into game development, and for the most part was made when I was just starting out as a programmer around 6\u00a0years ago. Consequently, there may be bugs present, but nothing game-breaking.</p>\n<p><strong>IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY BUGS:\u00a0</strong>Please run the \"Snakes\" minigame and have the snakes eat the bugs.</p>\n<p>Made with Java using\u00a0BlueJ and\u00a0NetBeans</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:34:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57c/57cd1aedb53423f4fcad40df597deec6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thirdhand"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
