I noticed that a lot of it has to do with speed and excitement. To emulate this I\u00a0made the timer also your HP.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When you kill an enemy you get 5 more seconds and when an enemy hits you, you lost 1 - 3 seconds. So this makes it a bit more of a flex if you want to try to end the level with more time. Giving 2 ways to play the game.</p>\n<p>With that said I ended up suffering a bit from creep scope. I haven't done a 3D game in quite a while and struggled to get the movement how I wanted. I wanted to also do a resource management system where you can use your resources to build platforms and things like that. I also wanted to do some sound effects and music but wasn't able to get to these too. I\u00a0hope whoever plays this prototype enjoys it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:37:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/326da070ddb1ad6aaeb5882817c7f5aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yanni"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
