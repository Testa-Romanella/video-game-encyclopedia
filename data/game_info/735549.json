An endless runner where you have to dodge obstacles. The goal is to get the highest score possible.</em><br/></p>\n\n<strong>Chill mode:</strong>\n\n<p><em>Put on your custom mp3s and let the game play by itself as it reacts to the sound. This mode can be used to make your children play or to have a synthwave screensaver with your decorations.<br/></em></p>\n\r\nMusical mode:\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING. THIS MODE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.<br/><br/>This video is a preview of the music mode in its final rendering.\r\n<p>For the moment you only have 2 \"levels\" available and which encounter many bugs. I have 5 much better modeled levels with various corrections to be made later, but I thought that giving you a playable preview will allow you to judge the game mode.
