It is always recommended to do good things so you can expect good from life but sometimes bad things happen even to the best ones, even to the ones that haven't done anything wrong \u2013 that is the point in our living when we feel that it is simply not fair. Those are the cases when people lose their lives while they are still very young; lose their home or closest family in some catastrophe and similar terrible things that happen suddenly and could not be avoided.<br/><br/>It wasn't a natural catastrophe the thing that destroyed the lives of the Jones family. It was something different but also terrible. The Jones are good people. They are not related to some criminal nor have some bad thoughts in their heads. They always appreciate life and they respect the people around them but again life is not fair since all members of the family are in prison at this moment.<br/><br/>People that act bad and do criminal things should go to prison, that's a fact but the thing is that they are in prison for something that haven't done. One very skilled detective is exploring this case and he likes to get justice because he is also convinced that the Jones are not guilty for the act.
