The\u00a0 archangel Stephie's halo was shattered into multiple pieces. Now the demons are using those pieces (as they possess great power) to cause trouble in all realms. You are summoned to the world between worlds so you can fight these demons and find all the halo's pieces.</p>\n<p>log 01</p>\n<p>This is literally my first ever game. And its been a real ride of making, dismantling and remaking some parts. The game itself has not yet gone far and it is still, more bare bones than clothed flesh. And juggling work, school and making the game makes it a little more challenging but i hope i can push through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am hoping you guys can check out my so empty prototype and maybe give me pointers and suggestions to help me grow as a game developer.I've head most first time games dont get Finnished, i hope i can finish mine. So please feel free to assist me where ever u can.</p>\n<p>Right now i am focusing most into that one playable character. I am doing, or rather i am learning animation in blender (thats why my animation is weird..lol). You will also notice that is u selct the other two characters the game will give u Gummie in the gameplay, sorry for that bt the other characters are not done yet those are just concepts/ place holders nd might even chnge with time. Also a friend also suggested i only give one male and one female playable character choices (makes sence coz as i have learnt, characters are hard to make) want to hear what you guys think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:32:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f8/9f8ce36e4053980d9d3e411194eaf18e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["studio.nurdyME!!"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
