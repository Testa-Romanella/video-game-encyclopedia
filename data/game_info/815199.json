Deploy various support structures along your way to aid you in your fight. Collect parts from wrecked units and use them against your opponents. Quickly change unit composition to adapt to the enemy's tactics and overwhelm them.<br/><br/>The game puts an emphasis on terrain verticality and gives you direct 3rd person control of your units, allowing you to easily navigate caves and tunnels, scale walls and ceilings, and blast enemy units off of cliffs and into bottomless pits.
