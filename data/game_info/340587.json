For example, if you wish to create a Common Pickaxe, the recipe asks for 5 Common Ingots. You must have the Common Ingots selected in your item bar (you must have 5 common ingots in the stack), and then click on the recipe to craft it.</p>\n<p>-After leaving a crafting station menu, be sure to click the left mouse button to regain full control of your camera.</p>\n<p>-Crops can only be watered by<em> purified</em> water orbs. You can also only drink purified water orbs.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p><p>Programming/Material Design/Modelling \u25ba Ethan Cook (https://etcook98.wordpress.com)<br/></p><p>Level Design/Main Menu Design/Material Design/Modelling \u25ba Brandon Norine (https://fusionfallmaster.wixsite.com/website)<br/><br/>Music \u25ba TeknoAxe (https://www.youtube.com/user/teknoaxe)</p><p>Random Sound Effects \u25ba Freesounds (https://freesound.org/)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/957/957639c69c99847534ecad72b4097707.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan Cook"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
