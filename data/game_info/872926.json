Invest, trade, and grow your net-worth while fighting economic trends trying to resist you. Made during Xanderjam 7. The theme was \"The Future\" and the restriction was \"Resistance\". I admit I had no idea how to implement the restriction, but I tried \"resisting economic trends\".

There is an abbreviated version of this\u00a0in game.</p>\n<p><strong>Basics</strong>:</p>\n<p>The game takes place in turns which equate to 1 year. Press the \"CONTINUE\" button to advance to the next year. The game lasts 128 years in \"LIFETIME\" mode (ends in year 3333). Play that mode to get a highscore. Once you enter a game, look for a company in the company list with a share value you can afford. (K = thousand, M = million, G = billion, T = trillion). The yearly revenue graph lets you see the direction the company value is going (it tracks the last 10 years). You can see expanded credits by clicking your credits.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying and Selling:</strong></p>\n<p>The main actions are buying and selling shares. When you buy or sell shares, a fee is imposed according to a percentage of the share value. (Example: you buy a share for 100K, and a fee is 10%, so you end up paying 110K.) Keep an eye on the share value and fee of the company you are interacting with. The switch above the buy/sell buttons sets how many shares you attempt to trade with a single button press\u00a0(1, 10, 100)</p>\n<p><strong>Investing</strong>:</p>\n<p>When you buy a company share, they agree to pay you dividends equalling 1/10th of your investment for the length you hold the share. That number is shown in \"RETURNS\".</p>\n<p><strong>Strategy</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p>You want to buy small amounts of shares if you want to sell them later, as the fees grow the more shares you own. But if you want long term investment buy big. Also, only investing in companies that are growing is the best bet (their card is green if they are growing)</p>\n<p><strong>Ultimately</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Don't think too hard.</strong> A single game takes just 10 minutes to play. It's easy once you understand fees and company growth.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T04:17:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc514d189b89021ab9eecb3ee8391d87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xenoparrot"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
