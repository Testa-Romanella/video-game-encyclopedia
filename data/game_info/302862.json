ShockRods is a 6v6 or 12 player free-for-all arena shooter, bringing all the blisteringly fast-paced action, mayhem and overpowered weapons you would expect. \u202f <br/><br/>ShockRods draws inspiration from the classic \u201ckill or be killed\u201d arena shooter greats of yesteryear with over the top weapons, explosions and insane mobility, but with a twist - the ShockRods! These customisable, technologically advanced vehicles, nimble but tough, are equipped with multi-directional boosters and the ability to double jump, allow for truly thrilling and action-packed gameplay.<br/><br/>It\u2019s easy to learn, but hard to master - a high octane, thrill-a-minute ride!<br/><br/><strong>Environments</strong><br/>ShockRods features 4 stunning, highly varied environments, designed to allow players to exploit their vehicle\u2019s manoeuvrability; with more to come as the game evolves through Early Access. These range from natural looking desert and woodland areas, to man made battle arenas, specifically designed for 6v6 or free-for-all carnage and mayhem. <br/><br/><strong>Game modes</strong><br/>ShockRods brings 3 classic, tried and tested game modes to the table: Death Match, Team Death Match and Capture The Flag. Plus, enjoy the full combat no-holds-barred Ball Mode - work as a team and protect the ball carrier as they target the opposition goal, or simply reduce your opponents to scrap metal and walk the ball home.<br/><br/><strong>Customisation</strong><br/>ShockRods allows for full customisation of your hulking war machines. Change your car type, colour, wheels, decals and patterns. Choose from a host of taunt FX and sounds, and much more, to show off your flair and style as you dominate your opponents. All the content is cosmetic and can be unlocked through currency earned in game based on your performance in battle.  <br/><br/><strong>Weapons and Power-Ups</strong><br/>ShockRods brings a full arsenal of explosive and somewhat unconventional weapon types to annihilate your opponents. These will be scattered across the environment for you to collect and put to good use. Want a Gatling Gun? Rocket Launcher? Grenade Launcher? We got you covered. Not your style? Try the Balloon Cannon, Freeze Gun or Bulldozer power ups!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/417/4174da0038a8a8ca473200a271aefabe.jpg", "website": "http://www.ShockRods.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 53}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 46, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stainless Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Green Man Gaming Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
