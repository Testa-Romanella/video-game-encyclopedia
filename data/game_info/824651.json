{"id": 824651, "slug": "a-seed-named-soul", "name": "A Seed Named Soul", "name_original": "A Seed Named Soul", "description": "\"A Seed Named Soul\" is an interactive poem based on some stanzas I\u00a0wrote in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep. My mind was racing with thoughts and I had to find an outlet to express them in an attempt to get some rest. After waking up the next morning, I read the poem to myself and thought it was one of the best things I had ever written. This was on November 22nd, 2021; since then, I have wanted to find a way to convey my story through a medium that allows others to experience the poem as I\u00a0did when I was frantically typing thoughts in my dark room at 3:00 am.\r\nThe idea behind the original poem was based on the concept of altruism and its opposite: egoism. Altruism is the mindset of sacrificing one's own personal needs for the sake of others, regardless of the price or pain that you yourself go through. On the other hand, egoism is the mindset of putting yourself first above all others, regardless of who you hurt in the process of becoming number one.\r\nThroughout the poem, you will be given scenarios in which there are three choices. Each choice will progress the poem in a slightly different direction, ultimately changing the outcome. The narration within the game is all done by me.
