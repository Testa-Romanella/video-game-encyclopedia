Knowledge and complex causal chain interactions previously locked in traditional artifacts become accessible with immersive data visualizations and bio acoustics reflecting scientific data sets to show two contrasting scenarios - Woodland in Balance and Woodland out of Balance. This Augmented Reality implementation is unique as it is uses the vision tracking features of the most recently released ARCore and ARKit SDKs producing a perceptual experience on parity with reality. The concepts and knowledge are easily accessible at a click of a button to hear the curator\u2019s interpretive narrative and access a complementary website of facts, The Virtual Garden Timeline. <br/></p>\n<p>The AR Perpetual Garden App was developed in part, as an international collaboration between The Harrington Lab at the University of Central Florida, The Powdermill Nature Reserve at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and the MultiMediaTechnology program of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Austria. Undergraduate and graduate students were involved in the production of the app. The multidisciplinary effort was developed with my partners, Dr. John W. Wenzel, Director, Powdermill Nature Reserve, CMNH and Dr. Markus Tatzgern, FH-Professor, Head of Game Development and Mixed Reality, MultiMediaTechnology program of the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences, Austria.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Apple iTunes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Harrington, </strong>Maria C.
