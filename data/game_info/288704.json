Our prime exports are artisan sandbags, the musical group The Cuttleboys, and of course, SNACKY BAY PRIME MAYONNAISE. Whether you've come to see some of our famous landmarks, (like that one really big building and the fountain outside the really big building) visit one of our famous museums, (The Contemporary Cart Museum features some of the finest modern carts of all time, including golf, go, shopping, and horse!) or perhaps sample some of the local cuisine, (Mama Bass gave me horrible diarrhea. It sucked, but my brother went there too and he was fine, so I guess it could still be good. The Beefy Reef is pretty decent too.) you can be sure that SNACKY BAY is the one location you won't want to miss out on for your next vacation!<br/><br/>This message was sponsored by the Snacky Bay Prime Tourism Office.<br/><br/>STORY<br/>Clam Man is the story of the Clam Man.

Using science.<br/><br/>\"He certainly is a clam man.\"  - Playtester<br/><br/>Thank You, Playtester - we couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>But to be more specific: This is the story of a man, recently promoted to junior sales representative, enjoying the comforts and leisure of lower-mid-level office work. However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery. Join him, as he unravels the conspiracy behind the tragic event that befalls him, and fight to restore CLAMMY JUSTICE to the world of Snacky Bay.<br/><br/>FEATURES<ul><li>A story full of twists and turns and a huge amount of strange jokes!<br/></li><li>More than 20 unique and strange characters to interact with!
