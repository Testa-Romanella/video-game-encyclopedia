A second block and hole is pre-set when you start this mode as well, although the original these were randomised too.</em></p><p><em>Sounds and graphics have slightly improved, my bug was fixed (realised RNG wasn't an integer without some extra code!).\u00a0</em></p><p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Use arrow keys / d-pad to move snake head - push the blocks (blue) into the hole to score a point. For each point there is a segment of body that follows the head. Keep going as long as you can.</p>\n<p>Press the O button / z key for reset, you can reset any time.<br/></p><p>Press the X button / x key for change game mode for next reset.</p>\n<p>There is no time limit, you can process at your own time and decide how quickly you want to go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T10:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/6588816ba80bafcaf8914d3aaa45d7cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikebloke"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
