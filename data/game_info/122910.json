I made it using exclusively Microsoft PowerPoint's animation system, using hyperlinked objects for player interaction. It's more of a linked visual novel than a \"game\" per se, but it's quite unique and I think interesting in that regard. I used to make games in PowerPoint like this when I was little, so I made this one last year in the style of those games I used to make.</p>\n<p>There are 6 different endings, and each give you a different poem or excerpt of a poem by Robert Frost.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40fcf481f524cceb593d4af4b783b786.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["katesmith"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
