Some of the same characters appear, but the stories are independent of each other and can be enjoyed separately.<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294380/_/<br/>This work and Case 02: Paranormal Evilwere co-developed by MaouCat Studio and Sounding Stone. These two games share similar gameplay elements but have completely different worlds and stories. <br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1662340/_/<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this game, you play the role of a warrior who enters the Tower of the Reanimator to search for an elixir. You must use your dice to fight enemies. It tests your decision-making skills...and your luck! Collect equipment to increase the number of dice you can roll. Develop your own strategy and embark on an amazing adventure!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You have a certain number of destiny points (DP). At times when your roll is not good enough, you can make up the difference with DP. This allows you to change your destiny in a critical situation. However, DP are a precious resource: you must use them carefully!<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are many different ways to get through the same stage. You can use strength to defeat enemies, or you can use agility to dodge traps. Choose a gameplay style that works for you, depending on your equipment and preferences.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What conspiracy lurks in the tower and how should you deal with it? There are two different endings available that depend on your behavior in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can select \"Hard Mode\" where the dice will only roll below 3 or \"Extreme Mode\" where the dice will only roll to 1. Prove how good your strategy is when it doesn't rely on luck!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T11:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a27/a27c9fe2ad4ddae2464d238d35af9224.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/MaouCatStudio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 248, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sounding Stone", "\u8001\u5949\u6bca", "MaouCat Studio", "\u9b54\u738b\u8c93\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Light of Creators"], "esrb_rating": null}
