It is the third game in the Street Fighter Alpha series, following Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors&#39; Dreams in 1995 and Street Fighter Alpha 2 in 1996, although it was released after the Street Fighter III series had already started (between 2nd Impact and 3rd Strike). The gameplay system from the previous Alpha games was given a complete overhaul with the addition of three selectable fighting styles based on Street Fighter Alpha (A-ism; called Z-ism in Japan), Street Fighter Alpha 2 (V-ism), and Super Street Fighter II Turbo (X-ism), new stages, a much larger roster of characters, and new theme music for all the returning characters.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-02T18:05:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/321/321da692849a96bf61ac07b28fd7d023.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.31, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 29, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 26, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 45, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 45, "platforms": ["SEGA Saturn", "Dreamcast", "PlayStation", "Game Boy Advance", "PC"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Crawfish Interactive"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment", "Sony Computer Entertainment", "Capcom", "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Virgin Interactive", "Soft Loft Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
