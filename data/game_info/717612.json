{"id": 717612, "slug": "winter-memories-onioncuttingninja", "name": "Winter Memories (OnionCuttingNinja)", "name_original": "Winter Memories (OnionCuttingNinja)", "description": "<p>On a late afternoon in December, you meet up with your girlfriend for a walk through the snow.</p>\n<p>While walking you two exchange memories. Funny, embarrassing, everything... until you reach your destination...</p>\n<p>------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>Winter Memories is my submission to the Winter VN Jam 2021. I learned about the Jam too late, so while I spent a couple of days with preparations, the writing was literally done within one day on the 31st of December 2021, which is why the VN is currently a lot shorter and simpler than what I'd have aimed for under better circumstances.</p><p>The idea for Winter Memories had been floating around in my mind for a few weeks already, so at least mentally I didn't have to start from scratch, otherwise I couldn't have managed this. Also a huge thanks to every artist/dev who put up the free assets and tools I used, it would have been absolutely impossible to make a VN in such a short time without them.<br/></p>\n<p>A large update will follow. That being said, the core parts including the ending are largely how I envisioned them, so the update will mostly flesh out the build-up and polish some rough edges (including the UI).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T04:44:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/45081a5c626b1d5d41850f970a3660de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["OnionCuttingNinja"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
