Help people survive or choose to be corrupt and heartless in this short adventure game. And remember even if you run out of space, there's always something you can do to help.<br/></p>\n<p>Why I made this game.<br/></p>\n<p>I wanted to bring to light the recent immigrant crisis, but without sounding overly political. So I chose to blend sadness and humor within a minimalistic experience. Exodus Terminus is somewhat of a mockery on how the news portrays immigrants and refugees as just another person with a sad\r\nface. How even a few of your choices and actions can completely change the future of a nation and it's people. I hope I've contributed something worthwhile. Cheers!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0b/d0bd75222a6f753c24e74197f94921cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SoMuch"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
