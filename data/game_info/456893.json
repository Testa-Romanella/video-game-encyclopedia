The story is about a group of unique and fascinating women with different life experiences, who help the Allies fight against the invaders and the evil zombie forces created by the invaders in the war. You will play as a Commander in the game. Train powerful troops and recruit beautiful female Officers to lead. Unite other Commanders to eliminate the Invaders and evil zombie forces and finally achieve world peace by establishing a stronger Guild!<br/><br/>1. Brand New Troop Control System<br/>The game uses a new free control system that allows players to command multiple troops to march, garrison, and change targets and marching routes on the battlefield. Strong troops cannot prevail without excellent leadership and strategies!<br/><br/>2. Vivid War Scenes<br/>We have created vivid cities and battlefields based on actual geography from late modern Europe, including landmarks that people will recognize. Plus, we have also simulated the famous war machines used during the late modern period, which aim to bring you back to the era when legends emerged.<br/><br/>3. Real-time Multiplayer Combat<br/>Fighting against real players is always more complicated and appealing than battling the A.I. You still need help from other players, even when you're strong because you won't be fighting against one opponent. It could be an entire Guild, or even more.<br/><br/>4. Multiple Countries to Select<br/>You can choose different countries to play in the game. Each country has its own Country Trait, and the combat units unique to each country are all famous war machines that served the countries throughout history. You can lead the army that you want in the game, and launch attacks on your enemies!<br/>Millions of players have joined this legendary battlefield. Expand your Guild, show your power, and conquer this land!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T02:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5e/c5efe2c1d75f384925dc725a3317bed3_hibq7df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["tap4fun"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Tap4Fun"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
