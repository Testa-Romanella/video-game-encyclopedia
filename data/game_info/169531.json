Flappy Knuckles has a shop to buy power-ups, unlockable characters, unlockable maps, story, cutscenes, achievements, an ascension mechanic (like prestige in Cookie Clicker or reset in Crush Crush), character-specific powers, tonnes of juicy Sonic references and more.</p><p>This is a game made by a Sonic fan, for Sonic fans!</p><p>-- NOTE --<br/>If you encounter a glitch or a bug, please please explain what you did to encounter it and what the bug does so that hopefully I can fix it in the future. That way it makes it easier for me to find the bug you're referring to and complete it in the future.<br/><br/>I take no credit for the use of the assets used in-game.
