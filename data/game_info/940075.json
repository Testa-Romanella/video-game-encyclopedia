{"id": 940075, "slug": "runeorde", "name": "RuneOrde", "name_original": "RuneOrde", "description": "<p>Runeorde is a roguelike/dungeon crawler loosely based on viking myths. You play as a nameless seidr, a viking seer, that uses the power of carved runes to enhance his attacks, walking through three scenarios that revolve around a mysterious story. <br/><br/>In every level you will find an altar, those altars tell you about the history of the world and how the events unfolded before you got there, as well as your personal story. You will also find creatures that want to fight you. By killing them you'll be able to gain more runes, which in return give you more options and choices on how to tackle every level.<br/><br/>This game has been developed by a small number of people, and it's the first or second experience for all of us. While being technically a complete game it's still missing some enemies that we planned to put in the game and some transitions could be better. So, you can probably expect some updates/bugfixing in the coming days.</p>\n<p>This was our entry for the 7DRL2023 challenge</p>\n<p>The Team: <br/><br/>Programmer: <br/>Jafarrolo - https://jafarrolo.itch.io/ <br/><br/>Sounds &amp; Music:<br/>Davide Bunino - https://linktr.ee/davidebunino<br/>Andrea Guerriero - https://linktr.ee/andrea.guerriero <br/><br/>Art &amp; Animations: <br/>IvoryRed \u2013 https://ivoryred.itch.io/ <br/><br/>Story: <br/>Montoya - https://unclimainfame.itch.io/ </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T06:12:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e3cc4446e04c8174d33c84516086941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jafarrolo", "IvoryRed", "Montoya"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
