Apart from moving around the environment by using WASD keys (or direction keys), player can also press FG keys (or NM keys) to rotate geometries in the edges. The different shape would have different effects when they contacted each other: ball erases triangle, triangle erases square and square erases ball.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:17:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf8/cf8edceabecd84b564bb4b1095253bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fionachen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
