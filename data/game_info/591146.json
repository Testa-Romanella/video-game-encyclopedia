Well guess what, one little boy actually achieved to dig this hole toward China. He came back to say goodbye to his family, and now he is ready and set to jump in, and dive deep, deep, until China. You play as this little boy, and will have to fly through the hole dodging any hazard that could cross your fall until you finally reach China.</p>\n<p>= =\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heyhey, so here we are again. Honestly I'm quite sad I had to starti this Compo quite late (16h after start eh), but I'm quite happy of the result.
