The game features an adaptive element in that the different explored attractions will have the given information modified based on user interaction with previous attractions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both an adaptive and linear version was developed, since this was a university project that needed both an experimental and a control group. The adaptive version contains the adaptive text system, and the world is procedurally generated with multiple paths allowing the\u00a0player to freely explore the city. In the linear version the text does not adapt and the city is generated beforehand with a smaller amount of attractions which are found on a linear path.</p>\n<p>Both the adaptive and linear versions can be downloaded below.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T10:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fd/8fd0147a2413639e609d2370741e7c7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["frededarling42"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
