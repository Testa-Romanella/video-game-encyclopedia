She lived a long life in Holten, a small Dutch village.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like many other people in the countryside, she was born and raised in the same village. When she got older, she married the love of her life and had 4 children with him. She was a kind woman, but all in all, there was nothing special to mention about her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of this changed when her husband died, and she started living alone. That's when the rumors started.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are stories going around about her regularly stealing stuff in the local shops and even breaking into people's houses. Some stories even mention ghosts!</p>\n<p>Was she going crazy? Whatever it was, there was definitely something odd about her.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T10:25:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc5/bc58c37c1149a8cab4c4d980ebefd009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kapistijn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
