But biggest of all, there is a massive sinkhole in the center of the city titled \u201cThe Calamity.\u201d Josiah descends this sinkhole to figure out this disturbance, and comes across a massive demonic structure in the center, filled with grotesque monsters and dark secrets, and at the way bottom the one pulling the strings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:55:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c5/7c50f77343fe904f6fbb66e9dc4b5779.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ElishRojo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
