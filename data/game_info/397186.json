Even though binding the controls to keyboard keys is possible, <strong>a controller for each player is strongly recommended</strong>. I've had most fun using the following bindings:<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>movement axis:</em> move your character, aim, duck</p>\n<p><em>jump:</em> jump while ducking to fall through a platform</p>\n<p><em>attack:</em> throw your disc, press again to recall it</p>\n<p><em>powerup:</em> use a picked up powerup</p>\n<p><strong>Powerups:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Powerups, after being picked up, spawn an icon above your characters head. Some powerups can only be  activate, when you carry or don't carry your disc. This is indicated by the icons opacity.</p>\n<p>[] Comet Strike:<br/>Throw your disc with high speed.</p>\n<p>[] Laser Beam:<br/>A deadly laser\u00a0connects your character and your disc temporarily.</p>\n<p>[] Quick Recall:<br/>Your disc speeds up and returns to you, even passing through walls.</p>\n<p>[] Invisibility:<br/>You become temporarily invisible.</p>\n<p>[] Teleport:<br/>Your character and your disc swap places.</p>\n<p>[] Rewind:<br/>Your character is followed by a shadow of its past self. Activate to jump back to a former position.</p>\n<p>[] Shield:<br/>Temporarily blocks of your opponents discs.</p>\n<p><strong>While already playable, Diskophoros is still in alpha. A known issue is map generation sometimes taking alot of time to finish. If map generation seems stuck, please have some patience and wait a minute. If you find any bugs or have feedback, please let me know.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa8/fa8f84303ff0a090283cfadee2ec1fcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nikolas M\u00e4hlmann"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
