I never really programmed anything neither have I done any pixel art, so this was basically a training and learning experience for myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within these 3 days I learned basics of pixel art creation and 2D Unity environment, so I\u00a0drew all art assets, made simple animation, programmed all necessary \"things\" and successfully built everything in Unity. There are still many things I would like to improve\u00a0some time in the future.\u00a0Since I'm an absolute beginner, this game wound't be possible with the amazing <strong>tutorials by:\u00a0</strong>\"Blackthornprod\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Z1XWw1kmnvOOFsj6Bzy2g\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Music by:</strong> Alexander Blu,\u00a0<strong>Sounds by:</strong> Juhani Junkala</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/399/399d6dbd88e89c63371aafd610e57190.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["EmiePinkBunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
