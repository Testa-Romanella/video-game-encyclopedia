There are 25 different blocks in the game from which the quests are generated, therefore it is possible (and very probable) you'll encounter a block you know after some time. </p><p>The goal of the project was to prove that it's possible to create a system that would generate a nontrivial number of quests from limited number of building blocks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/020/02005e3b6d10a7ee5eca40cd0b4ed536.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["gyfis"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
