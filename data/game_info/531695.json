A support crew is also en-route bringing supplies but, well... we haven't heard from them for a few hours so you'll have to find your own equipment.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Play \u2014</strong></p>\n<p>Search for supplies along the creek, then draw the 'clockodile' out using bait. Once you have a bite,\u00a0knock it out with explosives. She's a big girl so you'll probably have to give it a few tries.\u00a0Once you have the clock,\u00a0make it back to the boathouse! Your boat will take damage from the occasional bump and croc bite, so make sure it gets fixed up at the dock before you end up in deep water.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls \u2014</strong></p>\n<p><em>Keyboard/mouse</em></p>\n<p>W/S - Forward<br/></p>\n<p>A/D Turn</p>\n<p>Q/E - Swap Item</p>\n<p>F/LMB - Throw<br/></p>\n<p>Shift - Boost</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>Gamepad<br/></em></p>\n<p>LT/RT - Forward<br/></p>\n<p>Left Thumbstick - Turn</p>\n<p>LS/RS - Swap Item</p>\n<p>Face Button Top\u00a0\u00a0- Throw\r\n</p>\n<p>Face Button Right - Boost</p>\n<p>Face Button Bottom - Jump\r\n</p>\n\n<p>R - Restart</p>\n<p>ESC - Exit\r\n<br/><br/><br/><strong>Latest Build \u2014</strong></p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LP2wYC2-OotbYf3Tk4_ORjDmpeNc1vZ3/view?usp=shari...</p>\n<p>I always try my best to create a good experience but when it comes down to the wire\u00a0sometimes sneaky bugs\u00a0slip through.
