As the name suggests (Karpar is Cambodian for protect) the character will protect the local Cambodian community by eliminating waste in various locations around the Mekong river. I created Karpar through a few months of coding on a gaming engine called Gamemaker studio 2. I want everyone to enjoy the game I made, so I allowed it to be played for free. However, I hope that in return you are willing to support the Karpar project with a donation. <em>This can be done via 'support this game' or the following website: <strong>https://www.whydonate.nl/fundraising/service-project-cambodia/en</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>During the February break in 2019 together with my team (20 students) we will be going on a CAS trip for service work around the Mekong river in Steung Treng, Cambodia. The Mekong river has immense biodiversity second only to the Amazon river. The species include some of the most endangered and unique organisms in the world. For example, the\u00a0<em>Orcaella brevirostris\u00a0</em>an endangered beak-less species of dolphin and the\u00a0<em>Pelochelys cantorii</em>\u00a0a soft-shell turtle are both found in the Mekong river. Unfortunately, the Mekong river is under a lot of threat (illegal wildlife trade, climate change and pollution to\u00a0name a few) which is significant for the animal species and 60 million people that rely on the river for their livelihood. Pollution and\u00a0waste is a really big problem in Steung Treng (the local community where we will be doing service\u00a0work) which is why one of our tasks is to set up a recycling system.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>More information on the Mekong river:\u00a0https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/greater-mekong\r\n  </p>\n<p>My team and I will also be aiding the local\u00a0community\u00a0in a specific service project. The community\u00a0will\u00a0allocate us a specific project where they require aid (for example building a classroom). Our team will be involved in labour intensive hands on work (such as mixing concrete for flooring) along side with\u00a0professionals\u00a0to fulfill the communities needs. Additionally we will be giving\u00a0English lesson to the\u00a0children of the local community, learning about Cambodian culture and the importance of the Mekong river. In order to provide the materials, machines and other requirements for the community my team and I need you help. All donations will go directly to the community and I will make sure to keep you updated (specific tasks we will be doing, photo\u2019s, money collected etc). </p>\n\n\n<p>More information on what we will be doing:\u00a0http://monllorpalacios.wixsite.com/cambodia/day-6\r\n  </p>\n<p>Do you want to support this good cause? Did you enjoy the game so far? As a sign of gratitude I will expand the game for every 100 euros donated. Everyone who donates and wishes to can have their names incorporated to the list of supporters. <strong>Every euro counts and will be very much appreciated! </strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Website for donations (the website accepts a variety of easy payment methods): </strong><strong>https://www.whydonate.nl/fundraising/service-project-cambodia/en</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Thank you in advance and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Feija Somefun\u00a0 <br/><br/><em>Have you noticed any bugs or problems?
