It began as a small passion project as a means to bring myself out of a slump in my life, and it graduated into something far more ambitious than I intended. It's been a long road, and although I hope to keep my next adventure a lot shorter, I feel everything I've learned made it time well spent. I hope you enjoy my creation, I look forward to sharing my worlds with you.\r\n</p>\n<p><em>I had to make this second page for the demo because I goofed something up with the URLs.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f81/f81f5d8a6aadd5121fb384b093e7abdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zentient"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
