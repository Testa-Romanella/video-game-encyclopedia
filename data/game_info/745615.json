I think the Automated Behaviour system could be applicable to all types of games. My next goal will be to apply it to the air combat game.<br/>As it stands, this Tactics Shooter is as bare bones as I\u00a0could make it. No sound, no effects, no skill levels, just a skeleton of the game. Of course, I'm bursting with ideas I\u00a0want to put into the game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T14:01:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ea/9eae17cff91d01761cdf9d4ae35ae5d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["zorgitron"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
