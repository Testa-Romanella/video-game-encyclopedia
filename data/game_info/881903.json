Alternatively, you can just download the game to your computer.\u00a0</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>My final project for my Core Principles of Programming class during my second year of SCAD. In this project, we had to take a preexisting Unity game and make a mod out of it, so adding our own assets/changes. Since the class was an entry-level class and I have something like three years of experience in Unity development, I kinda went all out, making a whole slew of original models and basically completely reprogramming the game as a whole. It's by no means a finished game and will never be one, but it's by far my most polished product.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T13:59:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcb/dcbc8f0ed0229281309bfc95c3580d19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["treese"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
