The boy, Rufus, studied alchemy tirelessly in order to one day become a doctor to treat illnesses so that nobody would have to suffer the same loss he did when his mother died. His sister, Maria, was a kind-hearted girl who wanted nothing more than to make everyone she met smile. Their father, Milo, worked odd jobs around the village in order to properly provide for his family. One day, however, Maria contracted the same disease as her late mother. From his father, Rufus heard of a potential cure locked away in a tomb. In order to access the tomb, he would need to reforge the key that was shattered into four fragments and scattered throughout the land hidden in crypts. Years before, Milo attempted to retrieve the cure for his wife, but failed in the process. Desperate, Rufus sets out in order to save his sister\u2019s life.\r\n</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Made for GAME 290, Spring 2021</strong></p>\n<p>Ben Tigchelaar (narrative lead)</p>\n<p>Kaelyn Cline (art lead)<br/></p>\n<p>Caleb Millard (programming lead)<br/></p>\n<p>Nathaniel Klassen (programming + narrative design)<br/></p>\n<p>Shiyang Zhou (programming)</p>\n<p>Haley Brown (music + sound design)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T07:37:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5daa592927e275aaa5d5db9a957266c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TWU Game"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
