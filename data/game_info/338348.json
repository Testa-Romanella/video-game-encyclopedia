Mirror Image is a platformer that can be played with or without violence, allowing players to choose between an aggressive or strategic play style. Every kill will bump your morality meter to the right, and every life spared will bump it to the left. Try multiple play styles to see the various endings, each with their own visuals, music, and levels.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Conner Shaw\u00a0- Concept, Music, Level Design, Game Mechanics</p>\n<p>Erica Cherrington\u00a0- Art, Level Design, Title Screen\r\n</p>\n<p>Wendy Nguyen (me) - Coding, Art, Game Mechanics</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/688/688dbfb2836a25afa1b59681e1c7205a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["xmunchy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
