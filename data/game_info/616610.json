There are still somethings that could be added to improve usability, but the program itself should be fully functional.<br/></p>\n<p>================================</p>\r\nWelcome to the Logic Gate Engine!\r\n<p>This is a sandbox program for you to do whatever you can imagine. There are a lot of things you can make, and even more you can theoretically make. There is no goal or target, just you're mind.<br/></p><p>This program can handle 1000's of gates and has be tested successfully with ~38000 gates at &gt;60fps. Loading files with this many gates will cause the program to freeze for a short amount of time however this is the extreme case and most files will load almost instantly.</p>\r\nAvailable gates:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Button</strong> (Mouse Input: can be held down for activate)</li><li><strong>Switch</strong> (Mouse Input: can be toggled when interacting)</li><li><strong>Buffer</strong> (outputs the same as the input; can be used for delay or organisation)</li><li><strong>Not</strong> (outputs the opposite of the input)</li><li><strong>OR</strong> (outputs TRUE if any of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>NOR</strong> (outputs FALSE if any of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>AND</strong> (outputs TRUE if all of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>NAND</strong> (outputs FALSE if all of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>XOR</strong> (outputs TRUE if only one of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>XNOR</strong> (outputs FALSE if only one of the inputs are TRUE)</li><li><strong>Simple Light</strong> (displays a colour or combination of colours depending on the inputs)</li><li><strong>Light</strong> (displays white if the input is TRUE, otherwise displays black)</li></ul>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Camera Controls (Pan &amp; Zoom)</li><li>Gate creating, moving and connecting</li><li>Snapping gates to a 1/4 size grid</li><li>Duplicating gates and their connections</li><li>Deleting gates</li><li>Creating zones (acts as comments/notes)</li><li>No action mode (disables moving and connecting gates)</li><li>Save/load with .logic files (JSON files)</li><li>Highly performant</li><li>Stats about number of gates, mesh vertices, and FPS</li></ul>\n<p>=================================</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>The display settings and resolution settings don't work properly and may cause crashes</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T11:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe13a2b5de441c28e5cbb29256a97939.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mrwhimble"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
