[LEAKED ALPHA BUILD]", "description": "Salad-themed fun for everyone!\r\n\n<p>Welcome to \"You did WHAT?!?! with my salad?\"! A game that Shandy Pants has had in the works for several years now.</p>\n<p>With an over \u00a370 Million pound budget, we worked on this game with the collaboration and funding of the Tortoise Island Media Fund, and the game showcases the beautiful holiday destination of tortoise island, in all it's glory.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, depsite being well into development, we had what we call in the games industry a \"hiccup\". In what turned into a disheartening, and to be honest, quite ugly, dispute with Tortoise Island's governing body, funding was pulled, and subsequently the game was shelved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luckily for *us* though, I managed to find an alpha build, from barely moments before development ceased. We can be sure that this is the\u00a0<em>best version of the game,\u00a0</em>made by a team of eager developers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway, ignore all the NDA shizz (that doesn't matter anyway, right?!) and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T06:48:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/587ef9ecd77fd43da0d037e30a093146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shandy Pants Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
