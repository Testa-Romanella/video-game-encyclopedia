{"id": 317989, "slug": "gredlight", "name": "GredLight", "name_original": "GredLight", "description": "<p>GredLight is a video game that I made that actually works! This is a racing game where you are either going quite fast or not moving at all. When you are moving, enemies will not attack you. If you are stopped, they certainly will. The track consists of many tight turns and if you hit a boundary, you will respawn at the starting line. Players must find a balance between moving fast to avoid enemies and stopping in time to avoid the boundaries in order to finish the race. The first player to get their lap counter past three wins! Race for the best time or just defeat your opponent! GredLight works on Windows, supports mouse/keyboard and controller, and can be played alone or with a friend.</p>\n<p>Music: https://www.purple-planet.com/</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: https://freesound.org/</p>\n<p>Thanks to Eric Guadara for helping and CCM for being a college.</p>\n<p>Note: With mouse, the highlighted menu buttons look like multiple are selected, but only the one that is actually clicked is selected (aka it works how you think it would). This can be fixed by clicking on any part of the screen that the button isn't on. \u00a0Sorry and thanks for reading this for this long, have a secret: this game is both cool AND nice AND fun for your friends.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T08:26:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/24378cc48afcebb31999d4cba8d2d676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bobboziggy"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
