Feels unnatural with the heavy pollution of the city. Sucking on a cheap cigarette is a good way to fill the lungs with something that isn't car fumes and sewerage.<br/><br/>The stars dance idly in the sky whilst looming down on a sector of the City that was forgotten long ago.

Two months, and I've not even been once in to that strip club to make it rain cash. Guess I'm too much of a gentleman. Heh.<br/><br/>Mind you, I wouldn't know what to do in there even if I went in...<br/><br/>...perspective.
