In .FUEL, you take control of a small spaceship on its mission to defend earth from Alien Drones,\u00a0\u00a0while trying\u00a0to\u00a0not die yourself, from losing too much fuel.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow do I get more fuel?\r\n<p>While the game is running you are constantly losing fuel. If the tank hits 0, that's it for you. So how can you refill your tank? By defeating enemies! When defeating an enemy, they'll drop some fuel that you can collect. The higher your current combo, the more fuel they will spit out. But wait, Combos?</p>\n\r\nCombos!\r\n<p>By making defeated enemies fall into other enemies, you can increase your combo multiplier. The higher the multiplier, the more points you get and the more fuel you get. You might even get some crate deliveries sent your way.</p>\n\r\nItem Crates!\r\n<p>When you reach a combo multiplier of 5, an item create will appear. By collecting those, you'll get a random powerup. It could be a laser, a triple shot or even homing shots! But be fast. As soon as they leave the screen, there is no way to get them back!</p>\n\n<p>Those alien drones can be pretty brutal, by touching or shooting at you, they can deplet your fuel and you definitly don't want to lose all your fuel...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1be10de040038b0fa4d2e03bbd76a883.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benstar"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
