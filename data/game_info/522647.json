I had fun with the dialogue and (again) did not take myself too seriously while writing it.</p>\n<p>The story has swearing and alcohol references.</p>\n<p>Instagram art account: @alejandrocovianart</p>\n<p>Instagram music account: @alejandrocovianmusic</p>\n<p>I can do art and music for your projects!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T06:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/609/6094aad1b3c8dfe6be79328dc0309524.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Alejandro Covian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
