{"id": 46543, "slug": "field-of-glory-ii", "name": "Field of Glory II", "name_original": "Field of Glory II", "description": "It is 280 BC. Rome has defeated her main Italian rivals and is looking to expand further. First she must repel the invasion of southern Italy by King Pyrrhos of Epeiros. Then she will go on first to conquer the Carthaginian Empire in Spain and North Africa, then to push eastwards and conquer Greece, Macedon, Egypt and the Near East, as well as Gaul to the north. All this will take 250 years of epic struggle, at the end of which the Roman Republic will descend into civil war. Octavianus will emerge as the eventual victor and reign as Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Field of Glory II allows you to fight large or small battles for or against Rome, or between the other nations who are as yet unaware of the Roman threat, or what-if battles between nations that never actual came into conflict historically, but might have done if the course of history had been different.<br/><br/>Field of Glory II is a turn-based tactical game set during the Rise of Rome from 280 BC to 25 BC.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take command of a huge variety of armies employing vastly different tactical doctrines.
