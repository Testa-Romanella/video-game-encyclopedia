The player has jet-pack for additional maneuverability. The plot of the game tells about three actors and the film of the same name. The story told in the visual style inspired by 50s American science fiction.</p>\n<p>Space Explorer Dick Starspeed was wrecked on a mysterious planet. To find parts for a broken ship and his faithful assistant Robot, Dick goes on a dangerous journey across an unknown planet. The game presents a very diverse set of weapons: ray guns, crystal swords, and laser whips. All devices in the game can be improved with the help of spare parts found on the levels.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on the movie style: in the settings, you can turn on the comments of the alleged director of the film. They are the link between the setting, the characters and the events that take place on the set. In addition to the story campaign, the game has a Survival mode, which is entirely independent. The player receives some gold and weapons and is surrounded by enemies in the arena. A full-fledged multiplayer is not here, but the game still can be played on one device in a cooperative mode.</p>", "metacritic": 73, "released": "2016-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-04T21:05:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c14/c1484e3baaa7a2c048d457c8a55980ef.jpg", "website": "http://www.deadlytowerofmonsters.com", "rating": 3.16, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 77, "owned": 1276, "beaten": 89, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 74, "playing": 4}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 97, "ratings_count": 201, "suggestions_count": 419, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 203, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["ACE Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atlus USA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
