Players play pattern cards to dig up the dirt hiding these beautiful beasts of the soil. Pay attention though! Beetles move and aren't always where you expect them to be.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SETUP</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Shuffle the Beetle cards and lay them out in a 3x3 grid face down (X side showing).</li><li>Choose and flip 4 Beetle cards face up.</li><li>Shuffle the Shovel cards and place them face down to create your Draw deck.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>PHASES</strong>\n</p>\n<ol><li>Draw</li><li>Score</li><li>Check for Sets</li><li>Flip Beetles</li><li>Move Beetles</li></ol>\n<p><strong>DRAW</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Draw 2 cards from your Draw deck and pick 1. The Shovel card not chosen is placed at the bottom of the Draw deck.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>SCORE</strong></p>\n<p>Pick an area on the Beetle cards that match the pattern on the Shovel card. Add up all face up Beetle cards and write that score in the corresponding pattern spot on the score sheet.</p>\n<p><strong>CHECK FOR SETS</strong></p>\n<p>For every Beetle used to score, check off the corresponding spot on the score sheet. If a set is completed (i.e. Beetles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have been used), you unlock a Set Bonus. The first Beetle set is not required to be completed to add to the second Beetle set. However, the first Beetle set must be completed and scored before the second Beetle set can be completed and scored.</p>\n<p><strong>FLIP BEETLES</strong></p>\n<p>For every Beetle used to score, flip that card over. This will cause face up Beetle cards to be flipped face down and face down Beetle cards to be flipped face up.</p>\n<p><strong>MOVE BEETLES</strong></p>\n<p>Pick a row or column of Beetle cards and shift them up, down, left, or right. The Beetle card that shifts out of the 3x3 grid is placed on the other side.</p>\n<p><strong>GAME END</strong></p>\n<p>The game ends when your Draw deck is empty. Add up all the pattern spot point values on your score sheet with any completed Beetle set bonuses for your final score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:30:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb1d59a16faf2d4729ba7230dc037227.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Shen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
