Except you deploy a variety of units (9 different ones in total) with each their own stats and abilities. When deployed on the same square, they automatically fight for control. If only your units hold 3 squares in a line (row, column or diagonal) for a specific amount of time, you win. If the AI manages to do so, you lose.</p>\n<p>Made for the Vylocity game jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T05:58:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/638/63805a2f15f43f54fc653398020d8635.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Phailak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
