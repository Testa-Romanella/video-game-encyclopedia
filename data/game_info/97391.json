The first time it will open, though, will need some time to actually start. After the first time, it will be starting quickly, so... be patient please!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\r\n\r\n\t**Update**\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>&gt;08/02/2017: Updated. New coloration for monsters and every opponent is now more powerful, so that they will pose some challenge. Fixed lagging/hiccups while travelling on map. Fixed in-battle slowness.<br/>\r\n\t&gt;25/11/2016: Updated to version 1.3.2, fixing some skills, adding Donna's Shield Skills and Mace equipping, which were absent in older versions. Fixed the Spell Books to actually not be usable on Donna. Added a book with some information about the battle style of each character. Added Animations when the player opens a Treasure Chest (item). Moved the savefiles to a different folder,  so that if somebody played a previous version, they will not be able to continue their progress in the newer version. This was done like this, in order to not break the database. This update was done so that the Demo would be closer to the actual game gameplaywise, with correct skills and items.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t&gt;05/11/2016: Updated to version 1.2.0, fixing some animations, renamed and buffed some monsters, fixed some lag issues on an Imp spawn, fixed saving and loading issues, added some more torches and added a splash screen before the main menu. This is going to be the last update for the demo. We are focusing on the main game from now on.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\t&gt;24/10/2016: Updated to version 1.1.0, fixing pathing glitches in the anti-gravitational pads puzzle and some minor spelling mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visit our website orfeasgamestudio.com</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Find us on twitter </strong><strong>Orfeas Game Studio</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae2/ae258d44613889d9b8a2595ec0d25469.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Orfeas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
