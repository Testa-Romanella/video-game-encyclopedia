Don't let them!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Blood Head</strong>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tMore powerful and faster than their regular brethren. They like to circle you at a distance and take pot shots at you. Beware!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Zombie Head</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tZombie heads aren't too bright but they don't need to be. They die in a massive explosion of gore if they get too close, soaking you in gross headjuice.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Skinned Head</strong>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tHaving no skin while in the vacuum of space sucks. Skinned heads spew out a tonne of projectiles at a high rate out of sheer rage.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Gold Skull</strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCollect 10 of these for a nice surprise.
