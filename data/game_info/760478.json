All art is original.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>After starting the game with [Enter], there are tower shops on the left. Go to one and buy a tower (press [E]). The cheapest and least powerful\u00a0tower is on the bottom. With it above your head, go to one of the available plots (marked by a sign) and place it down. It will begin shooting any incoming enemies. Enemies killed will get you more coins, with which you can buy more towers.</p>\n<p>There is a \"wind-up\" bar above each tower. It progressively winds down until completely empty and will stop shooting. While your player is touching a tower, mash [E] to wind up the tower again.</p>\n<p>Finally, don't let enemies leave through the other side. You have 5 hearts, and each enemy through hurts. Try to survive until the end (there is a win and a lose condition).</p>\n<p>Game Jam Theme: Can't Stop</p>\n<p>- While constantly having to buy and place towers while rewinding already placed towers, you cannot stop moving around and interacting otherwise you will surely lose.<br/></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements:</p>\n<p>Music from YouTube Audio Library - Cattle by Telecasted</p>\n<p>Monogame Framework</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T04:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/587ba0307f7b95da88710645794447b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["honased"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
