But now the time has come to finally create my first videogame project, an idea I have dreamed of for over 10 years. I want to create a sidescroller platformer game that can only be played by listening to audio cues. The idea is to make a game that can be impactful to sighted people and maybe interesting for visually impaired people.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Video fo the prototype/proof of concept</em><br/>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game will be about an unnamed character who has to find what has been lost, yet the character can't see and uses audible cues to get along. Gifted with the power of knowing the future (aka the player's memory) the character is able to solve the puzzles, avoid or defeat enemies and find what was once lost.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T12:34:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/162/16277e60e24e2bf63141904a0b53cc2b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex the Emperor Penguin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
