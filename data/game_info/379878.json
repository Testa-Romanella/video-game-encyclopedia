I made this game in 48 hours for my first game jam,\u00a0Ludum\u00a0Dare 45. Your goal is to collect a lot of items and bring them back to your house. The theme was 'start with nothing'. I ran into a few problems along the way (like build times over an hour) and that's why there's barely any audio. All the audio was added in literally the last 5 minutes. Also it might be a bit buggy, sorry about that! But ignoring all of that, I hope you have a fun time playing MiniRPG!
