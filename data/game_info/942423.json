Left click to shoot/move, P to pause, F to full screen, and M to go to menu! Also click the volume button to turn off the music while the game!<br/></p>\n\n<p>One N' Gun is an infinite round game where you use the recoil of your shotgun to move. As the rounds move on the difficulty increases, it starts simple, then it becomes a bullet hell game that doesn't wait for you to clear the map! Try to get to the highest round without dying to the other guns that follow you around! Be the last and only weapon standing!</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for Wonder jam #1 and it also marks the last game I make on the engine I am using!</p>\n\n<p>The idea of this game was based around the theme one weapon. I thought it would be a good idea to include a gun (since it is a weapon). I also thought about movement and finally ended up with this OK game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T16:05:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34b/34b91772ea6f4a1dce5207387d000d43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Droplet Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
