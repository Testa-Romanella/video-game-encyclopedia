Such as how to jury rig all your assets from an instagram comic\u00a0^^; I hope that's okay!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T03:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b3/0b3156f53580df5c22bee7aaba1ab84d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["IronyDaniel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
