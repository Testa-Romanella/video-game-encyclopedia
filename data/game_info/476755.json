You get to complete tasks and gain money to get more land.</p>\n<p>How To Play:</p>\n<p>Your goal is to claim as much land as possible. You can complete this by completing tasks which\u00a0 grant you money. Money is good. Money makes Pepe happy. You can get crops by tilling grass. This will turn the grass to soil. Now you can select either lettuce or tomato by clicking either icon. To plant them, simply click on the soil. Once you have planted the amount that you need, click \"Next Round\" and the next round will happen. Both lettuce and tomatoes take three rounds to grow. Each task has a round limit and if you do not succeed, you will not be granted the money from the task. If you do get the desired amount for the task, click \"Submit.\"\u00a0You can get more land by clicking the \"Upgrade\" button. If you have enough money, your land will expand. That is good.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move the camera around.</p>\n<p>F to return to your plot.</p>\n<p>ESC to quit the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:52:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88b/88b68bde36382c14ab84b362cf9340be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HighwayStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
