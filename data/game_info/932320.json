If you cannot open either the story web or the file, you may consider viewing this video recording me playing the entire digital story. This is\u00a0<strong>NOT RECOMMENDED!</strong>\u00a0The point of the project is to let you play the story yourself.\u00a0\r\nAlso, this story contains\u00a0<strong>music and images</strong>. Every clickable word\u00a0<strong>should</strong>\u00a0trigger either images or sound effects. If you cannot hear the sound/cannot see the image, it means your PC/mobile phone/web browser is not compatible with this story. In that case, you can also view this video, which contains all the images and sound effects.\u00a0\r\nlink to the video:\u00a0\r\nkSue7Mq7mh8<br/></p><p>p.s.
