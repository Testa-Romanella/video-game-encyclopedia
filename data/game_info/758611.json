Enough is enough. It's time to venture through the woods, conquer the fortress, and delve into the heart of the dragon's lair to take back what's yours and teach those dragons a lesson.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeglin plays like a combination of Peggle and Slay the Spire. The enemies are tough, and if you're defeated your run is over, but you've got powerful orbs with special effects and incredible relics that influence both your enemies and the physics you'll use to defeat them.Features:\n<ul><li>Collect and upgrade powerful orbs and relics to defeat the monsters and bosses that stand in your way.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Fight enemies with Pachinko-like gameplay - hit more pegs to do more damage. Use crit potions, refresh potions, and bombs wisely.\n<br/>\n</li><li>Explore a new forest every time, with different orbs, enemies, and surprises along the way.</li></ul>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T04:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb3/fb39023157cc59520894ddfbe8fe12af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 24, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Red Nexus Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["IndieArk", "Red Nexus Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
