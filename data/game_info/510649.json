I didn't get as much art done as I wanted to, but it'll be fun to expand on the game later down the road<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS [mouse only]<br/></p>\n<p>Left-click:\u00a0 click on a block and hold the button to drag the block around the screen. Any block can be swapped with another.</p>\n<p>Right-click: normal blocks that are matched in groups of three or more will glow. Click on them to set off the whole group for points. Bonus blocks can't be matched with others, but can still be clicked and removed. If you're dragging a block with the left mouse button, right-clicking will instead send that block back to its original spot.<br/></p>\n\n<p>NOTES<br/></p>\n<ul><li>You have a brief window after removing a match of blocks to remove another match, which will increase your score multiplier for as long as you keep that momentum going</li><li>Rank is based on score and determines how quickly your timer decreases</li><li>All blocks except bonus blocks will restore your timer to full</li><li>Bonus blocks have their own unique timers so that the longer you leave before their timer expires, the bigger the points bonus will be. They may seem worthless or distracting during hectic play, but that points increase could push you towards the rank threshold that resets the timer's speed</li><li>It's a good idea to set up lots of little matches to remove them all at once for a huge combo and rank increase; you can stall the timer with a match here and there</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-26T04:42:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d687125ca8f87e35384c122232820f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["1988stevenm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
