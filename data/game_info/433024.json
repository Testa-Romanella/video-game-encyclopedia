A full release is soon to come on Google Play and Steam!</p>\n<p>From Pastel Peaks Production, Personal Space is a puzzler about escaping the clutches of friendship! Guide your character through different social landscapes without raising their anxiety too high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why We Made Personal Space: The purpose of Personal Space is to create the experience of social anxiety for any player that interacts with the game. We wanted to make this game because it opens up a really important conversation about social anxiety, how it affects us, and why we need to talk about it. We think it's important that, even if you're not someone prone to social anxiety yourself, you can empathize with the experience and with other people who may feel social anxiety in their daily lives. We want this to be a game that fosters a sense of community. It\u2019s about understanding that even if you experience social anxiety you\u2019re not alone. A lot of us are anxious, and in that we can find community.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74b/74b97fe90dc86cc63afcdadd8525e481.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["personalspace"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
