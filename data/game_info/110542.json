Point and hold to disintegrate fairies.<br/>Each level (for now there are only 4 levels) unveils new types of fairies:<br/>Green Fairies will heal you on bite and damage you if you disintegrate them<br/>Blue Fairies are fast and strong disintegrate them first<br/>Red Fairies explode destroying nearby fairies and damaging you if they're too close.</p><p>You can also use your Hands if they come too close to drive them away.<br/><br/>Game is all done and running, however missing some of it's funcionality which were planned at the begining.<br/>Main thing is that there was supposed to be ability to draw gestrues with the wand to create a spell that will charge up your hand so you can cast it on the foes or on yourself (healing, wind blow, magic shield,  speed, blinding cone etc.).<br/>My brother and I started working on it about a month ago, so I think it came out pretty good as for 2 people.<br/>There was no much time to balance the game properly either so sorry for that...  and please let me know what you thing I should change in it.</p><p>All comments on the  game  and it's clumsiness, especially these negative ones, would be much appreciated as well as your ideas for future of the game.<br/><br/></p><p>Who knows, if there will be some interest in the game maybe we'll continue and come up with another version. </p><p>More open space version :)<br/></p><p>Versions for iOS and Linux can be downloaded from here:</p><p>http://anywaay.com/files/Toothunt_iOS_v1_0.app.zip<br/>http://anywaay.com/files/Toothunt_Linux_v1_0.zip<br/></p><p>Credits to:<br/>www.freesound.org<br/>www.freesfx.co.uk</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5e13d5a9ec23e766f18e0d986b1c87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["miron83"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
