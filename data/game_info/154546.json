You can still kill the chicken with the axe and collect it's meat.</p><p>- There was a second shack that initiated a visitor to arrive and allowed you to accept or reject them into your camp depending if you wanted their skill set.</p><p>Follow me to find out when the reboot starts</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1daabc228ec6c23c0ccda4e7463291c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["decksixteengames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
