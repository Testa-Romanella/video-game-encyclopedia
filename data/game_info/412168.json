But watch out for enemies!\u00a0A single touch and you're dead! Whenever you go up or down on a string, all enemies will freeze - so use this at your advantage. With a bit of practice, you'll fly around all the baddies in a breeze in all directions.</p>\n<p>Will you reach the end and beat the final boss?</p>\n<p><strong>Features\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Stupid simple classic arcade mechanics</li><li>12 enemy types with their own behavior that become increasingly\u00a0complex as you face them together</li><li>25 levels. No randomization whatsoever. Huuuh?!</li><li>7 incredible movie-like cutscenes (I might be overdoing it here)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Touch-screen :</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<li>Left-side of the screen : move your character / cursor (in menus)</li><li>Right-side of the screen\u00a0: eat the string below you / action (in menus)</li><li>Top of the screen : open pause menu</li>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Keyboard:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys : move your character</li><li>X, Y or Z : eat the string below you</li><li>P, Esc, Enter: Pause menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Proplayer's tip</strong>\u00a0:\u00a0Did you know? You can actually kill enemies! For this you'll have to partially eat 3 segments of a string, the middle one being almost finished (1 munch left) and the two surrounding others eaten one time (2 munches left). And get that, you get 100 points for that. WOW!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Proplayer's tip\u00a0II</strong>\u00a0: Some enemies can 't be killed... or can they? Legend is told that if you figure this out, you could potentially get 500 points each time!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Proplayer's tip III\u00a0</strong>:\u00a0Make use of the <em>Invincibility Shafts</em>\u2122 -\u00a0 the extreme right or left sides of the levels. Some enemies can't touch you when you're there. Use this at your own risk... and advantage\u00a0;)</p>\n<p><strong>Author's note</strong></p>\n<p>This is a project I've been meaning to finish for a loooong time. The first design doc I did for it dates back to October 15th 2010!\u00a0This is the third time I restarted coding it from scratch. The previous version was made in\u00a0Flash in 2014 and was sadly abandoned halfway through because of my studies. So I'm quite proud of having finally completed it\u00a0:D Have fun!</p>\n<p>Made with\u00a0\u00a0with Phaser 3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T04:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4d/b4dfc536851628fa8bae8a59175bedd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LeSam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
