Pocketed in the coves of skeleton bones and abandoned coral archways, there is a foreboding sense of danger that lingers throughout the unsettling air. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA small boat in a big ocean, you must traverse the darkness, evading the monsters that loom throughout the cold depths of the sea. Scattered throughout the world are buoys, small beacons of hope that will protect you from the monsters. But only temporarily. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYour one way out of this place resituates in the thick silhouette of the distant lighthouse, the large tower spotlight that stands far away.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T18:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6a/d6a1fab80b2fd7df6d3522f85cae7cf1.jpg", "website": "https://sites.google.com/view/oddestseagame/home?authuser=1", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harbored Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Harbored Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
