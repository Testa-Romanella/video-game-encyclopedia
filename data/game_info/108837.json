Do you have the wits to even the odds?</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Choose commands with the mouse, the rest is presented ingame.</p>\n<p>The inspirational theme was the concept of \"Awesome Per Second\", a pretty open term\u00a0which led me to look for ideas that made sense with a reasonable amount of content condensed on\u00a0a short form, but could lose their appeal on an expanded edition. Which led me to this turn-based\u00a0 one-battle wizard duel with a bunch of silly creatures.</p>\n<p>The game is on an overall stable state, with a bunch of possible features pending (mainly more developed patterns for Spirk), but the core gameplay is present with a good share of goofy animation. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>UPDATE - AUG 20 - Fixed a font display issue.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fc/9fc52062508e36adf8c6b1c594399f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Butzbo"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
