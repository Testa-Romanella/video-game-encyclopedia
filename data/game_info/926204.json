It simulates the tension, uneasiness, and anxiety we feel when we are in a public space, and the stares we feel from others.</p>\n<p>\r\nThe game also gives a reason for this anxiety: it is not that others are staring at us, but that we are staring at ourselves. At the end of the game, players need to let go of their excess self-consciousness and discover the specific person behind the imaginary gaze.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T11:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/1407aa8df2b5f57f1d96302a8de53c17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lea.yayaya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
