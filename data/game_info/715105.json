And pay some medical bills. And buy medication. And buy food. And pay taxes. And do all this other shit that costs money. Anyways, very coincidentally Ian's dad used to go to these robotics competitions that have 1 million dollar cash prizes. Also coincidentally, they take place in the same neighborhood. Even more coincidentally, it's happening the day before rent is due!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Don't play this if you're under 18, there are jokes about <strong>SEX </strong>and also mentions of disturbing content that's just unfortunately a part of life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game length:</strong></p>\n<p>I set a stopwatch\u00a0 twice and each time the game came out to be about 34 minutes. And that's if you do my method of cheesing the game and talking to everyone.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>Defend doesn't work randomly, I don't know why but I'll figure it out eventually.<br/></p>\n<p>After using a full heal, the character that used it won't have their health display as  100. It's 100 but the game's just weird like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Side notes:</strong></p>\n<p>I recommend talking to all of the npcs with both characters every round. If you don't, and decide to talk to them on a later round and switch characters after talking, it'll be clear something was skipped.</p>\n<p>I can't guarantee this'll play correctly on Easyrpg or wine.</p>\n<p>&gt;\"What does this have to do with winter?\"</p>\n<p>It's snowing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T06:06:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/101/1010c6a0d5dad9f6a88601c7dbfb86e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["retinacyst"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
