New technologies have accelerated space exploration and brought space travel to the masses. However, there remains one major barrier: space debris.</p>\n<p>In this all-new VR experience, you the player are transported into low-level orbit around the Earth. You will take part in an initiative to clean up space debris ahead of a pending rocket launch. The aim of the initiative is to extend the service life of functioning satellites, and to remove non-functioning satellites from orbit. By doing so, we hope to reduce the need to deploy new satellites and minimize the physical barrier between the Earth and the rest of space.</p>\n<p>Join the initiative today and prepare the way for the future of space travel!<br/></p><p>Developed by team Emotional Damage for Immersive\u00a0Environments project</p><ul><li>Evan\u00a0Huang</li><li>Tung Huynh</li><li>Ivan Lee</li><li>Kaitlyn Lam</li><li>Nika Styk</li><li>Leo Xiong</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T09:18:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee56561bbcf2f7855c1af5dfc7aaec3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["highpine"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
