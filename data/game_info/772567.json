Child the classes outlined in the documents, or use the Child classes already created for you in the Example project, to receive direct updates in your own project!<h3>Required products this template does NOT include</h3><ul><li>High-quality root motion fighting style animations (fighting games require special attention to animations, they are the driver of the tools found in this kit)<br/>Animation Mirroring Tool (for alt-stance, not needed if your animations are already mirrored)<br/></li><li>Complex AI programming (for CPU enemies)</li></ul><h3>Recommended products to use in this template but not required</h3><ul><li>Input buffer (for handling complex combos). The base classes of this template are reparented to the InputBufferAdvanced plugin classes in a branch on the GitHub repo so you can receive updates AND use a third party buffer. This buffer is worth the coin and is highly recommended for getting the most out of your project.<br/></li><li>Subsystem for your target platform (Steam, EOS, etc)</li></ul><br/>The price of the template will increase as more value is added to an already exhaustive list of features, so grab your copy and start producing your next unique fighting game experience today with FREE updates arriving regularly to give you more of what you need!<br/><br/><strong>Technical Information</strong><br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><ul><li>Designed with inheritance in mind - child everything included in the template to keep receiving active updates to the product as they arrive.<br/></li><li>Database model - define your characters, levels, etc in data tables and let the system do the heavy lifting for you<br/></li><li>Easy to use on a surface level and commented throughout the project to help guide you through its more complex features. Alongside an always expanding documentation set and discord support for verified users!<br/></li><li>Utilise the power of the advanced input buffer, with classes reparented for you so you don't miss an update while using a third party plugin! How to acheive this is all documented and walks you through the process.</li></ul><h3>YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW C++ TO USE THIS PLUGIN. DESIGNERS HAVE FULL CONTROL!</h3> Since this is a template to an actively developed game, this asset needs to be in C++ for various advanced code implementations in the project.
