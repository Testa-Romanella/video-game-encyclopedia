Go head-to-head against the galaxy\u2019s toughest creatures in heart-racing bullet-hell combat.<h3>WE\u2019VE GOT A PLANET TO SAVE, PARTNER</h3>At the edges of the Frontier Galaxy, the notorious Grimheart Gang have driven away every peaceful settler and taken over the planet TombStar. Free the planet from the tyrannical grip of their leader, King Killcard\u2026 or die trying.<br/><br/><br/><h3>UNLOCK AN ARSENAL OF DYNAMIC WEAPONS</h3>From splattering shotguns, to the powerful Armageddon Expander, or the festive Fireworks Cannon, there\u2019s a whole lot of ways to serve justice to those wretched Grimhearts.<h3>DISCOVER GAME-CHANGING PERKS</h3>When the going gets tough, seek out the morally questionable Duon brothers to provide you intimidating perks. Upgrade these enhancements and soon you\u2019ll have the Grimhearts shaking in their boots.<h3>CHOOSE YOUR GUNSLINGER</h3>Play as Jack Galloway and strive to become a galactic hero just like your father. Step into the shoes of Benson Gara, a Lyroid-species environmentalist taking matters into his own hands. Or live up to the legend that is AJ Starchild, a highly decorated sniper gone rogue to seek her revenge.<br/><br/>Discover each character\u2019s unique abilities and play styles to find your strongest contender for defeating the Grimheart Gang.<h3>PLAY AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN</h3>Blaze your way through hordes of assorted space scum, from pistol-wielding cowpokes to robots with death lasers. But stay sharp, the game changes with each run so you never know what you\u2019re gonna get.<h3>MANY YARNS TO SPIN</h3>Collect messages from the past to piece together what happened on TombStar, and learn each character\u2019s motives for taking down the Grimhearts. Where is Jack\u2019s father? Why did Benson Gara come here alone?
