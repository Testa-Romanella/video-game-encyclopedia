{"id": 201527, "slug": "hackathon-bots", "name": "[Hackathon] Bots", "name_original": "[Hackathon] Bots", "description": "Objective\r\n<p>Robots is a game where you control a robot and try to survive as long as\r\nyou can. Other robots will spawn and attack you. But fear not! Dodge \r\ntheir bullets and fire your own to destroy them and gain loot and other \r\ngoodies. These will help to upgrade your robot.<br/></p>\r\nControls\u00a0\r\nDesktop\u00a0\r\n<p>Up - Move forwards\u00a0</p>\n<p>Down - Move backwards\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left - Turn left\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right - Turn right\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space - Shoot\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shift - Show ingame hud\u00a0</p>\r\nMobile\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0In the bottom left you have dpad, which works like you would expect. In the bottom right you have two buttons. The right one, will shoot if you press it and the left one will show the hud.<br/></p>\r\nFeatures\u00a0\r\n\u00a0Comprehensive battle system\u00a0\r\n<p>\u00a0Your robot has 4 main states, namely attack, defense, speed and health.\r\nAttack and defense are used for damage calculation once your robot is hit. \r\nThe formula is quite complex and tweaked, such that you last at least a few \r\nhits before you die. Speed controls not only your translation speed but \r\nalso how fast you can rotate. And health is the most important stat you \r\nneed to focus on. Once it drops below zero you are dead. Don't worry!\r\nYour health is replenished after killing an enemy robot.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nLoots\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>There are several possibilities to gain loot within the game. The most \r\nobvious one is to open chests by destroying them. Once they are opened\r\nyou get a persistent boost of one of your main stats. So do not focus \r\nthat much on killing robots and get some chests too!\u00a0</p>\r\nBosses\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>Every once in a while there spawns a boss robot. There will be a special \r\nnotification for this event. The boss will be displayed as a red dot on \r\nthe minimap. But be careful the boss has way better stats than any other\r\nrobot including yourself (probably). Also the boss has special attacks\r\nlike the stun jump and a periodic meteor hail. Each robot will explode\r\ninstantaneously upon boss collision. Boss fights are only for the best\r\nof the best. But believe me it is worth it. According to the legend one\r\nwill receive its power when a boss dies!\u00a0</p>\r\n\u00a0Environment\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>The world of Bots is dangerous by itself. But pay attention to your \r\nsurroundings. There are random events, which you should avoid. This can \r\nrandomly placed oil on the road, which will slow you down or even \r\nmeteors dropping from the sky, which will likely kill you instantly. \r\nSometimes the earth shatters for no reason, stunning each robot nearby\r\nfor a certain time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>HUD\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Keep everything in sight by using your hud. Simply press shift (or tap \r\nthe button when you are on mobile) and show your HUD. This contains \r\ninformation about yourself, the current robots ranking based on their level\r\nand a basic help as well as a \"how to\". Never get lost with your HUD!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88a/88a68dfa84fbf4808d795fb4de54ce0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dasheck"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
