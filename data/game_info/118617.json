(Submitted within the last 5 min , phew!)</p><p>I learned as I went along and had fun. I hope you enjoy this game.</p><p><strong>Personal note:</strong></p><p>This started off as a challenge that made me try, even with limited time. I don't think I've been as stubborn and persistent in my life to do something.

For some reason sometimes this happens. Not sure why it does that, but this should solve the issue if it happens.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/5096d1b5fd934018e8a36f9cfa3b371e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lunazura"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
