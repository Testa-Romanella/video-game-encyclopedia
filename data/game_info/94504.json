This gives a nice fullscreen view.</p>\n<p>I've also added some background images to choose from and some color options to customize the view. <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Blind levels can be completely customized</li><li>Calculates payouts</li><li>Custom sounds and background possible</li><li>Fast forward/backward time</li></ul><p>Starting from version 1.1 there is also the <strong>Home Poker Tournament Player</strong>. Run this program in the same local network as the Manager and the player will duplicate the screen, making it possible to have multiple devices displaying the stats around the place where you host your tournaments. <br/></p>\n<p>If you have any comments or things you think I can improve, do let me know! I will be using this software myself, so if I find anything that can be improved I'll make it happen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6e/c6ec01d5297df72009a49cd7cf934865.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ava"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
