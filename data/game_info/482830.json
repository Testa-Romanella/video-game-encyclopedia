{"id": 482830, "slug": "listen-sparky", "name": "Listen, Sparky!", "name_original": "Listen, Sparky!", "description": "Listen, Sparky is a voice controlled prototype of a\u00a0game.\r\n<p>The prototype is created to run a study as part of a master's thesis at the university of Bremen.</p>\n<p>You are a shepherd and to your side is your loyal sheepdog Sparky. Unfortunately all of your sheep escaped from the meadow, because the gate was left open. Luckily you have Sparky to your aid helping you to collect and bring back\u00a0your sheep.\u00a0Sparky listens to every command you say with your actual voice. You can navigate him through a variety of tricky\u00a0levels. But make sure that your poor sheep stay away from the hungry wolf...</p>\r\nWe would love you to be part\u00a0of our study\r\n<p>After playing our prototype we would like to ask you to participate in\u00a0the study we are currently running. Following questionnaire will not cost you more than 10 minutes of your time, promised.</p>\n<p><strong>To the Questionnaire</strong><br/></p>\r\nTechnical and privacy note\r\n<p>The game uses a microphone to record the voice. Recordings only take place, as long as the space bar is pressed. Every voice recording (maximum 2,5 seconds each) is sent to the Google Speech API. The data is not stored or collected\u00a0in any way and not even accessible to\u00a0the creators of the game. The data is by no means personalised and not identifiable.</p>\r\nHaving trouble opening the application on a Mac?\r\n<p>Do not double click the app, instead use right click - context menu - open. MacOS sometimes doesn't like internet-downloaded games.</p>\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\r\nCreated by Tobias Schnackenberg, University of Bremen.\u00a0Special thanks to Nima Zargham &amp; the work group Digital Media, University of Bremen.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T05:38:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/760/76009680f506b3f9fb720b38e31547a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Golden Axe Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
