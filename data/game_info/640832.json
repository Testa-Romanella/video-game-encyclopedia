I think it turned out very nicely. The theme was carnival games, with all 3 disciplines contributing to the project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My contributions to this project were, overall design and direction, organization of tasks and priority, the object shatter script and the voice acting of the in game Barker. Yes, you get to enjoy me yelling at you every time you miss a target, what joy right? :)</p>\n<p>This was made with the Oculus Quest 2. Should just need to copy the .apk to the headset and run.</p>\n<p>Controls, In order to start the game, you have to shoot the button on the desk just to the right of you.</p>\n<p>You then have to shoot the same coloured arrows into the same coloured targets.</p>\n<p>C&amp;C is more then welcome, virtual reality is a very interesting platform for games, I can see it having great fitness potetional.</p>\n<p>Cheers Mates!</p>\n<p>Andrew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T05:47:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8df/8df34700bc2089d3df4b78e239c56434.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Spinks"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
