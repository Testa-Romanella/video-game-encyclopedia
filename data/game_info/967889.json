{"id": 967889, "slug": "love-is-all-around-2", "name": "Love Is All Around", "name_original": "Love Is All Around", "description": "We are \"intiny\", we are all \"split personality\" nerds who want to have date every day, but will never step out of the house to the real world. Thereford, we would like use games as tool to create one fantasy dream after another, to create dreams for players, and to make our dreams to come true for ourselves.<h3>Written at the end</h3>At the beginning, we said we were going to make a game, and then there were a lot of topics. As for why we finally chose love, it may be because the pictures posted in the intro slides are eye-catching . We, nerds in the team, had suddenly become impatient. Then we immediately decided, \"I want to fall in love , I want to date girls!\" After we\u2019ve decided the topic, we started to collect \"secrets\" from our friends.<br/><br/>The nerdy guy, named B, his first love was on the night of the graduation party of high school. He saw the female classmate who shared a table with him, drinking and singing with others, and only then did he realize that this girl was so  interesting and adorable. But after that night, he never saw her again ;<br/>L (he paints a lot and do it for a living, but he does not allow us to call him a painter) once fell for a girl who is five years older than him. The girl repeated the final year of high school 4 times, but still didn\u2019t get herself enrolled in the professional Fine Arts school, and finally let go of the obsession and became a substitute teacher in an art institution. That is the reason why L studied Fine Arts;<br/>A College student ,C, fell in love with his fellow student, but this girl had a childhood sweetheart;<br/>W,born with a silver spoon, is a little luckier than C, but not much. He did have a childhood sweetheart, but when they grew up, this girl got married with another guy;<br/>G,a wage slave, once met a single mother in a blind date event. He have made up his mind to go further with this lady. Unexpectedly, she has already met another one.<br/>\u2026<br/><br/>All these emotional and heart-breaking experiences are full of regrets and make people feel sad. We originally wanted to use this as the keynote to write a love story full of regrets but unforgettable, but our friends said that life is already not satisfactory, why not sprinkle some sweetness in the game? So here we goes, we have \"Damn! I am surrounded by beauties\" now. It's a satisfying love story. Hope my friends will be healed by this story. If you happen to have such a girl in your memory, it would be an honer to our the production team.<br/>By the way, there is actually another friend of us, X, my college roommate. He is still studying in university, doing experiments and writing papers day and night, and he is relationship virgin. He said he wanted to find a sugar mommy, because he wanted to have hair transplanted.<h3>Follow us</h3>Follow us for latest information on \"Love is All Around\".<br/><br/>FB: https://www.facebook.com/Love-is-All-Around-114374868341130<br/>Discord: https://discord.gg/JCakKmHPr", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T13:17:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/044/044c7e7fa223a7824b79b6ddbee76921.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["intiny"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["intiny"], "esrb_rating": null}
