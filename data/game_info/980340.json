From the creator of the original Kerbal Space Program and a tiny team of just three dedicated developers. KitHack Model Club combines state-of-the-art physics with endless customization options that will see you and your friends bringing your wildest RC creations to life.  <br/><br/>With the opportunity for limitless adventure and built from the ground up for multiplayer, KitHack Model Club is the ultimate model-building platform.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Be it a plane, boat, car, or an ingenious hybrid of all three, you can construct anything you can imagine by simply attaching parts together in the Vehicle Editor. Give it wings, wheels, engines, rockets, paintball guns and more; then really make it your own by adding paint and decals. <br/><br/>And your every design decision counts! Even the slightest tweaks you make on your vehicle will influence how it handles, as the simulation takes its actual geometry into account for aerodynamics, buoyancy, wheel friction and everything else.  <br/><br/>Show off your creation by taking it into multiplayer matches with up to 16 players, or share it on the Steam Workshop, to join an ever-growing collection of player made vehicles. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore the diverse and colorful landscapes of beautiful Wirraway Bay. Test your mettle with challenges, or free roam with friends across the island with your unique creations. The ideal environment in which to perfect your craft awaits the adventurous modeler. Just watch out for traffic and pedestrians! <br/><br/>Play KitHack Model Club exactly how you want to play. Craft your own missions and challenges with the powerful Scenario Editor - a fully-featured gameplay authoring tool which gives you complete control to create your own game modes. In fact, this is the same tool the developers themselves use to create missions.  <br/><br/>Challenge community members and flaunt your ingenuity by publishing your missions on the Steam Workshop, or just explore the limitless gameplay possibilities from the community-made collection. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>KitHack Model Club was built from the ground up to support modding. You can add custom content including new parts, maps, and even entire new features, then share it with the community via the Steam Workshop.  <br/><br/>To help you get you started, we\u2019ve got an SDK package including tools and examples, plus an amazingly friendly community where you can chat with other players, creators and even the developers themselves. <br/><br/>Have fun out there, KitHacker.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:38:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c41/c41109811abd0873d196e6228521594f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Floating Origin Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Curve Games", "Floating Origin Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
