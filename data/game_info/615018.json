Establish R&amp;D Outpost. Communicate Research.</li></ul><br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Building</strong>: The terrain is fully destructible. Structures can be built from concrete, wood, metal and rock resources wherever you like. <br/></li><li><strong>Factory Automation</strong>: Automate mining and production. Distribute electricity. Layout conveyor belts to provide resources for your factory machines.<br/></li><li><strong>Research</strong>: Every resource can be analyzed. Your findings will be communicated back to earth, in exchange for new blueprint unlocks.<br/></li><li><strong>Technology</strong>: Every 3d asset in the game is voxel-based. The terrain and all 3d models are rendered smoothly using marching cubes (no blocks).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T03:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee7/ee735516371c21039a71607c956f06eb.jpg", "website": "https://outpostengineer.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Decraene"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["WombatBarn"], "esrb_rating": null}
