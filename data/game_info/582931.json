You won't fail forever though - the gods aren't without mercy, and they give vague hints when you do the offering. Maybe one of the items was the correct shape? Or perhaps one had the correct symbol in it? Or it was in a correct position? Or some combination of the three - or better yet, all of them? They will tell you, though with cryptic symbols. You will also see your past sacrifices and their hints to help you figure out what the gods really want.</p>\n<p>The temple itself being woven inside in the fabric of space time, and logical rules of traversal do not apply. Rest assured though - the same exit you used to get to another room, will bring you back. Sometimes the rooms seem to overlap, and spiral into themselves. Luckily you have no retry limit to learn the layout - except of course until the lock-keepers decide that they have had enough. Which is coincidentally exactly 9 tries. Don't ask, we have no clue either.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Z</strong> - Jump/Accept<br/><strong>X </strong>- Shoot/Cancel<br/><strong>Arrow Key</strong><strong>s</strong> - Move<br/><strong>Down (on altar)</strong> - Pick up Jewel<br/><strong>M</strong> - Toggle Mute</p>\n<p>Gamepad support might be in there.

Incidentally, the MindGrind Master code is also only 3 Jewels long.\r\nPersonal Restrictions\r\n<p>My main motivation behind joining this gamejam was to have an excuse to practice more pixel art, with a restricted, 16-color RGBI palette at that, and with a screen resolution of 256x192. (Spoiler alert: I failed a bit at the screen resolution, I realized too late that I had designed the room generation to fill the whole 256x192 resolution, and I still needed some HUD elements. So I cheated a bit and increased the height to 208 pixels. It's barely noticeable.\ud83d\ude10\u00a0). <br/><br/>All the sprite and tile\u00a0elements needed to fit in a single 128x128 tilesheet image, which consists of 256 8x8 sprites/tiles. The reason for this arbitrary specificity is my hobby project, KAPE 8bit, which is an 8bit homebrew computer/console I've been making for almost a year now, since summer 2020. These restrictions mirror the capabilities of KAPE 8bit quite closely, and I\u00a0want to practice making pixel graphics for it and eventually make (somewhat) enjoyable games for it.\u00a0You can read more about it here:\u00a0KAPE 8bit blog</p>\r\nTips for gameplay\r\n<p>The first part of the game is running and jumping around in a procedurally generated dungeon. You have to collect jewels, and after you have 3 collected, exits light up and enter any to enter the end puzzle room, the <strong>MindGrind Master</strong>. The puzzle is a modified <strong>MasterMind</strong>, with 3 different shapes, and 3 different symbols (the symbols are also designated with colors). There are also no duplicates in the code. If you brought the correct jewels in the correct order, you win and are given access to the treasures inside the temple dungeon. If not, you are thrown back to the upgrade menu, where you can upgrade your character, and see the hints for the mastermind code.\u00a0 It is recommended you analyze the mastermind code here, and when you have decided what combination you try out next, you can use the \"Set Reminder\" feature to set yourself the combination you are thinking about. This Reminder combination will be shown on the top of your screen during dungeon gameplay, so that you don't have to frustratingly keep forgetting what you combination you were going for. You can still change your mind during gameplay though, it's just a reminder you put there yourself!</p>\n<p><strong>NB. </strong>The hints are not indicative of position per se! First, full on correct symbols are counted and hints shown for that. ie. You have 2 of 3 correct (the hints don't tell you which ones) so you get 2 fully correct hint markers before anything else. Then correct jewels (same shape and symbol/color) are counted, and shown. Then shape\u00a0 only, and lastly symbol/color only. With these hints it should be possible to deduce the correct code in max 9 attempts.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>NB2.</strong> Max attempts aren't limited, as I didn't have the time to implement an \"attempt\" limit, but the screen runs out of space to show more hints, so there's your automatic limit then kinda :D</p>\n<p>Source available at\u00a0MindGrind GitHub Repository</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T20:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3c/d3c8f4adc70443a228461efc0c47a588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["zment"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
