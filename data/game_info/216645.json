People love it!<br />\n\u221e Infinity Loop is the most trending game in 2017. It can be considered a puzzle game about creating intricate looping patterns or just the application of using a simple concept: &quot;connecting multiple things&quot; and make fun out of it.<br />\nSo, this is a simple, relaxing and endless game.<br />\nSome people say this game is like the XXI century Tetris game but with a great zen mode. Even tough it might resemble tetris, the goal is to clear your mind, remove the stress from your daily life without any pressure or tension to solve the levels.<br />\nEnjoy the loop!<br />\nFAQ<br />\nHow to Play Infinity Loop?<br />\nConnect all the lines and corners to make perfect connections. It is like killing the chaos and reaching perfection. Watch the video to overview how it works. Check on youtube as well where several people post the solutions. Nonetheless, we suggest you to try to find yourself how the game works and what are you supposed to do.<br />\nHow to Play The Infinity Dark Mode?<br />\nThe goal of the dark mode is to make disconnections, breaking it all and not leaving a single piece connected.<br />\nHow many levels the game has?<br />\nInfinite.<br />\nHow can I save my game progress?<br />\nMake sure you connect the app with the Game Center on the settings panel (the button is in the bottom of the gameplay). This way your progress won&#39;t be lost. If you face further issues reach us by e-mail.<br />\nDo I need to pay anything to play Infinity Loop?<br />\nNo. The original game is 100% free. There is no need to pay anything for the original game. The game is free for unlimited levels. Only if you opt for the secondary game, called &quot;black mode&quot;, you may need to pay a coffee for it after playing 100 free levels.<br />\nI don&#39;t feel the game is challenging. Why?<br />\nThe challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now. Just Relax and play.<br />\nConcept and Development: Jonas Lekevicius, Balys Valentukevicius</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T14:19:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13d969a9e744ea9d4a7acb7bcf9cbd2d.jpg", "website": "http://loopgame.co", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["WebAvenue Unipessoal Lda", "\u221e Infinity Games"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["WebAvenue Unipessoal Lda"], "esrb_rating": null}
