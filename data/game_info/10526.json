But a strange sickness gripped the once-verdant paradise, and strife runs rampant. A few proud legions still stand tall, but each dawn brings a new wave of peril.FEATURES<ul><li>4v4 session-based, multiplayer strategy<br/></li><li>Multiple legions (races) and 100+ unique characters<br/></li><li>Matchmaking, ladders, achievements, reconnecting, player profiles, and stat-tracking<br/></li><li>Frequent content and balance updates</li></ul>OVERVIEWLegion TD 2 is played by two teams of four players on a symmetric playing field. Players defend their own lane against waves of enemy creatures that threaten their team\u2019s king. The team whose king survives longer, wins. From start to finish, a match lasts around 20 minutes.GAMEPLAYLegion TD 2 is like a tower defense, but instead of building towers, players deploy dynamic fighters that come to life. You can't move a fighter after it is placed, so plan your formation carefully. Each round, your fighters battle a new wave of enemy creatures.<br/><br/><br/>Your fighters move, attack, and cast spells automatically! After each wave of creatures is defeated, your fighters return fully restored to their original formation. You receive gold for completing the round. Spend gold to deploy additional fighters or upgrade existing ones. Each wave of creatures is stronger than the last, so be prepared!<br/><br/>Hire mercenaries to attack the opposing team. Each mercenary you hire permanently increases the gold income you receive at the end of each round.<br/><br/>Protect your king at all costs. Your fighters are the first line of defense, but if enemies make it past your fighters, they will attack your king. To win, you must defeat the opposing team's king before your own.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-24T16:32:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/4510219a4f9038ead999610310cb41c3.jpg", "website": "http://LegionTD2.com", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 672, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 12, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 57, "ratings_count": 23, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 24, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AutoAttack Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AutoAttack Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
