I\u00a0also wanted to incorporate the idea that players can stop playing a slot machine at any time. In this game, I\u00a0tried to make it more enticing to keep drawing cards than to 'cash out,' meaning that players would play until they have no money left.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T07:13:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f89/f89b6c4611897a1672cf787f1a61fef1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["phoub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
