There have been major natural disasters in a lot of the cities in Daitoryo and as the president it is your job to try to save some of the cities and people. Unfortunately, you only have the money and resources to save one city at a time, so choose wisely\u2026\r\n</p>\n<p>The game will show you two cities at a time, one on the left screen and one on the right. It\u2019ll show you each city\u2019s \u201cstats\u201d that include food production, money, tourism, population, education, technology and culture. Each different stat has a slider that can be either red or green. If the slider is red then this stat will decrease and if it\u2019s green then the stat will increase. If you right click on the mouse then you save the city on the right and if you left click you save the city on the left. Based on your decisions, Daitoryo\u2019s overall stats (in the middle screen) will change. You will only have 7 seconds to choose which city you want to save so you\u2019ll have to make your decisions quickly. If you don\u2019t save any city after 7 seconds pass, you will lose both cities and Daitoryo\u2019s stats will decrease dramatically. After you save 6 cities, the day will end and the UN will try to help you by giving Daitoryo some more supplies and therefore boosting the country\u2019s overall stats. When your stats eventually get too low, all the people in Daitoryo (the population) will die and the game will end. If you somehow save all of the cities then you won the game, good job, you should run for president!\r\n</p>\n<p>So how is this game related to the theme?\r\n</p>\n<p>The theme was \u201cLet There be Chaos\u201d, and essentially the game surrounds a chaotic country that is getting destroyed by natural disasters and it\u2019s your job to decrease the amount of chaos in the country.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special thanks to:</strong></p>\n<p>MD Interactive:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/c/Michieldankmeijerofficial</p>\n<p>Models from Sketchfab:</p>\n<p>(1) ( FREE ) Office room low poly - Download Free 3D model by SDC (@3Duae) [9a42c0f] (sketchfab.com)</p>\n<p>(1) low-poly radio - Download Free 3D model by Alex_models (@neoprocessor) [5ba382e] (sketchfab.com)</p>\n<p>(1) Desk - Download Free 3D model by TMGreed (@TMGreed) [cc01584] (sketchfab.com)</p>\n<p>(1) Retro Computer &amp; Monitor - Download Free 3D model by JasperTobias (@JasperTobias) [8926293] (sketchfab.com)</p>\n<p>(1) Old Monitor - Download Free 3D model by Daniyal Malik (@daniyalmalik) [9748cdc] (sketchfab.com)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T17:52:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/7110b8863da114cd88632e49a6a5ed00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Serg1"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
