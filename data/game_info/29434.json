{"id": 29434, "slug": "hardwar", "name": "Hardwar", "name_original": "Hardwar", "description": "The time is somewhere after the future, the place in space is (Misplaced) Optimism: nine craters eaten into the unforgiving crust of Titan, a nothing nowhere colony adrift at the wrong end of our experience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere all time eventually turns into never, while tooled-up Scavenger Operators and Ram-Runners fight for the right to courier the last of Titan\u2019s worthless riches, dwindling resources and frozen body parts back and forth between Neo-Feudal Inter-Planetary Government Sponsored Corporations and Mutant Underworld Cartels \u2013 All of them dying to possess the last breath of Lazarus Faction Air.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBefore the Optimism became (Misplaced), during the time of investment, MineCorp imported Off-World Pioneer Titan-Dollar workers to build and maintain the gigantic artificial oxygen refineries and pyramid economy serving their mining operations. Ten years ago, Titan was declared uneconomical. MineCorp shut down and returned to Earth. Work, rest play, die became trade or die.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI\u2019m an operative and like every other wised-up sucker here, I gotta get off this ball of rock! I need money, so I\u2019m gonna make a past I\u2019ll want to forget. The name of the game is trade and upgrade: A bigger Moth with better software and hardware; but on Titan progress has it\u2019s price and so do You\u2026Here the rarest commodity of all is Loyalty. More power means more cargo means more money means more power means more enemies\u2026Hardwar means trade up or trade in!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou\u2019re now an Operative too, a free agent and a speculator in the claustrophobic terminally ill city of (Misplaced) Optimism, the last crater cluster on barren mined-out Titan. Scanning comms channels for salvage or sabotage jobs throughout the hostile craters and tunnel links, you aim to better your reputation, gain credit, enhance your Moth (your ship, your only real asset) and ultimately escape Titan. A fantasy for all, except the powerful and influential. You are free to do what you want within the solar-powered city, the lightwells which charge ships and power the craters are free, but hotly contested.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExpect payback for any serious criminal behavior. It\u2019s always a question of who you know; if you scratch no-one\u2019s back, there\u2019s plenty willing to stab yours just for the opportunity. Your maintenance is delivery, escort and salvage. However, as your reputation grows, you\u2019ll pick-up more lucrative work like bounty, assassination and demolition. The payoff is big-time and so are the risks, but to trade up to a Warp-Drive Moth with special F.U. model firepower, on board CPU, top comms and inter-planetary capability, you need all the Hardwar you can get!", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T06:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1a1f792af8fbdb039eb5775431a2df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Software Refinery", "Jordan Freeman Group"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Funbox Media", "Gremlin Interactive", "ZOOM Platform Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
