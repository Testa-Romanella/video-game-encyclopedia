Raycasting was most famously used by Wolfenstein 3D to render 3D-like environments. It works\u00a0by converting the distances of rays cast from the player to the walls, to pixels on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>The game has 7 actual controls, with an alternative control scheme, see below:</em><br/></p>\n<p>Move -\u00a0<strong>WASD</strong> or Arrow keys<br/>Attack - <strong>X</strong> or Space<br/>Options -\u00a0<strong>O</strong> or Escape<br/>Open map -\u00a0<strong>M</strong> or Tab</p>\n<p><strong>Options</strong></p>\n<p>Here's an explanation of the various options available in the game:</p>\n<p><strong>Music (on/off)</strong> - When music is off, footstep sounds will be played instead<br/><strong>Keypress (one/several)</strong> - How many keys can you press simultaneously? For example, you can't rotate and move forward if it's set to 'one'<br/><strong>FOV </strong>- Field of view, default is 80, not sure why you'd want to change it but it's an option<br/><strong>Framerate (15, 60, uncapped)</strong> - The framerate of the game's raycaster (rendering), 15 is the default because it came closer to the framerate of a Nokia 3310. If you want the smoothest experience, try 'uncapped'<br/><strong>Colors (normal/invert)</strong> - Speaks for itself, some people may prefer inverted colors<br/><strong>Restart\u00a0</strong>- Press this multiple times to restart the game (can be used if you get stuck for whatever reason)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>I spent a lot of time on the rendering engine itself.\u00a0I had to build almost everything: rendering walls, rendering sprites, sprite occlusion, depth/z-buffer, texture mapping,\u00a0text and font rendering,.. It's been a wild ride but I've learned so much from making my first raycaster. I've always wanted to learn how to make one, and I'm really happy with the result.</p>\n<p>The 'only' things left to Unity is all the 2D logic, I used Unity's 2D physics and raycasting. The rendering of the game itself is completely left to my raycaster, drawing pixel by pixel.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T05:53:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/521fb3fee92fa9692ad37c438dc54019.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Liam"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
