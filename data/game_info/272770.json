You will be trying to mind your own business and collect coin-like objects while being hunted by evil red squares. But out of no where you will get scammed. This game is also a scam, it is clearly a scam I would not recommend playing this for your whole life. Spending money on this will not change your life in any way. However it might help you pass the time, the loading screen is pretty long so there's a cool feature. It is totally intentional too. The game has state of the art pixel graphics, and the music will help you sleep. By sleep I mean, obviously you will have nightmares, but you will close the game so quickly you will not be on your computer anymore. This game is clearly a public service that should be rewarded with the utmost respect.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nControls are:<br/>\r\nWASD to move<br/>\r\nSpace to shoot<br/>\r\nCursor to get scammed", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T05:12:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/92668171bd7c604920f63d4fac9d0959_F65Kff2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["POP POP", "Sean Marty"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["POP POP", "Sean Marty"], "esrb_rating": null}
