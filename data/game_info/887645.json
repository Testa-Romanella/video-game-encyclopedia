One treasure in particular, however, may have proven to be more trouble than it's worth.\r\n</p>\n<p>It has been two months since Ardain, Istar, and Ryze's expedition, and the ramifications of their actions have since reared their ugly head. What challenges they must face in the beginning does depend on your choice at the start of the game, though...\r\n</p>\n<p>The upcoming journey will take them far beyond the reaches of the kingdom, but they have little choice but to take on a new quest\u2014a quest to destroy the cursed sword of KYLE.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, hope is not lost for our heroes. There is a great deal of magical equipment to find while exploring. They also can make use of an encyclopedia listing every foe, item, and status effect they discover, and more!
