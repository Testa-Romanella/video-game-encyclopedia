I took this theme and ran with it creating a game where when you die your old body becomes a platform for you to use later. HOWEVER, I also require you to complete the levels in a set amount of time, this time can be increased by collecting clocks. This allowed for some brilliant puzzle design and fun platforming.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>When downloading make sure you choose carefully between windows and android. Windows is a .exe file and android is a .apk file.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing, I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T14:31:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fcd66da08ec5058e762eb3d3fc9329d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kroyisyorkgames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
