As they went up the mountain they found a giant Narra tree that had strange markings on it. The two being curious on what the seal is for went for a closer look. The two cannot make out what the markings mean, and as a joke Pepe tried peel the seal from the tree. The moment he pealed the seal off, a bright flash of light came out and the moon was suddenly dyed red. When the light calmed down, Pepe was not around but instead a group of strange creatures were littered in the surroundings. Tonyo frightened of the strange creatures decided to run back down from the mountain. Tonyo learned from his uncle, Tito Eddy that some people including Tonyo received a heightened sixth sense allowing them to see and interact with creatures of old.
