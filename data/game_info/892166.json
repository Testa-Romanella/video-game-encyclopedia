This town is inhabited with\u00a0furry friends excited to have you along - we hope you enjoy the stay!<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cCapybara Town or Cappy Town seems like a wonderful place to visit, albeit the weird name. Why is it called Cappy Tow- wait\u2026 is this whole town inhabited by capybaras? There\u2019s capybaras sipping lattes, capybaras playing in the playground, capybaras living in apartment high rises, capybaras everywhere?! What is going on here?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Cappy Town </strong>is a 3D environment built within the Unity World engine, with 3D assets made in Blender. Featuring a low poly design that complements the development team\u2019s blossoming skills as 3D world builders, we aim to fill this world of ours with objects found in a rainforest town attraction, a place where one can relax and enjoy the scenic atmosphere. Audio will be used to create or enhance this atmosphere, sounds of the rainforest (light showers of rain, animals and avian creatures cawing in the background, etc). Each member is fairly new to 3D creation and Unity so we aim to keep it simple yet expansive and somewhat rewarding to explore this tiny town. The world is set in a first person perspective to fully integrate the sense of immersion and exploration as we are perceiving it through our own eyes, instead of looking above a character.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Class: ART 107- SEC 01, San Jose State University</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keyboard Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WASD\u00a0keys |\u00a0Walk\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Spacebar | Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse | Camera view</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sounds/Audio Credit</strong></p>\n<p>Capybara Sounds<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<p>Sophia Martinez - Lead Interaction Designer/Asset Developer\r\n</p>\n<p>Richer Fang -\u00a0Project Producer/Asset Developer</p>\n<p>Gabriela Vargas\u00a0- Lead Environmental Designer/Asset Developer/Video Editor</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T09:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1be313c3e7d352549d3227dda7f0d130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Symartinez21", "xotwodgaby"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
