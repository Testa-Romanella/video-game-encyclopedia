In an odd container world, a bottle saves a cup from the evil Formula then start their journey together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Life`s but an empty bottle, a silent container, that wonders and accepts, colored by strangers.<br/>In a world that everybody is nothing but a bad temper jar or a broken cup or an orphan barrel, you, as a normal bottle, and used to be a dry-dead one, is trying to make some sense of your life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can communicate with others by words, or more \u201cprofessionally\u201d and emotionally, by exchanging fluid with others. And their response is not always positive. Don`t be afraid. You will meet your destiny, and a girl. From certain perspective, they are the same thing.  <br/><br/><h3>Do the Right Thing.</h3>Sometimes it`s flirting with a bottle of perfume, sometimes you must pretend to be a pot. Or just open a regular lock with a regular key. Pouring into others to get extra information. But don`t overdo it. An empty bottle is nothing but a dead one.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-13T02:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f31d6d0f2c96c992f5cb660f34e19b3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nerve Singer"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Gamera Game"], "esrb_rating": null}
