{"id": 488174, "slug": "light-the-midnight", "name": "Light the Midnight", "name_original": "Light the Midnight", "description": "<p>Light the Midnight is a horror-themed puzzle platformer inspired by the works of Dr. Seuss and H.P. Lovecraft. You play as an electrician who must keep the lights on and fight the monsters that have taken over the city. Your only weapon is a flashlight and your health is limited. Do you have what it takes to face the cosmic horrors that are waiting?<br/><br/>This game was a submission to PIGsquad's Horror Summer Slow Jam for August 2020. The jam theme was \"Don't Let It Out\". We decided to interpret this as not letting some sort of monster unleashed to the world. So we decided to go with Lovecraftian style cosmic horror for the monster which is the Tentariph. But how can you keep the monsters contained? We then came up with the idea that the goal of the game is to not let the lights out and that keeping them on will keep the monsters at bay.</p>\r\nTHE TEAM\r\n<p>Starring:\u00a0Nicholas Ryszkowski</p>\n<p>Character Animation by Jessica Koehler</p>\n<p>Environment Art by Matthew Ryszkowski</p>\n<p>Programmers:\u00a0Micah Neitz,\u00a0Jake Reilly,\u00a0Matthew Ryszkowski,</p>\n<p>Music by Ghost Stories Incorporated<br/></p>\n<p>You can support continued development of Light the Midnight by sending a donation through itch.io on this page upon downloading.
