{"id": 374088, "slug": "generation-ark", "name": "Generation Ark", "name_original": "Generation Ark", "description": "<p><strong>Generation Ark</strong> is a larp for 2-8 players about the inhabitants of a generation ship realizing they'll never get to where they're going. It is a game about finding connection within despair, and, sometimes, the overriding power of that despair.</p>\n<p>Players create their characters by generating the way they react to despair (their death), and the gift they can offer others who are in despair (the life they give). They also choose someone whom they love the most, the one who they hope to give life to.</p>\n<p>Then, players generate their ship, scene by scene, and alternate between group scenes surrounding a central activity or conflict, and personal scenes in the immediate aftermath of those scenes.</p>\n<p>Play ends after the players have personal scenes following the news that they will not reach their destination.</p>\n<p>This is a rules-lite game, and there is very little instruction regarding facilitation or safety. Please use your best judgement and expertise to ensure the game runs smoothly and safely for everyone.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T06:50:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edbb14fe0d324827ffb31d31ca24f1a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kazumi Chin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
