Download might require some extra dlls, comment if you have any issues and I can help you with that. I would appreciate if you could leave some feedback on game feel. I'm not sure if the enemies/player are too small, the player seems hard to find sometimes. I think the health system is too easy to not die for a while, but then randomly you'll get 1 shot. I don't really like that but let me know. Thanks :)<br/></p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ul><li>Enemies don't collide with asteroids</li><li>Player can sometimes get inside of the asteroids</li><li>There is a band about 1/3 of the middle of the screen that draws the tiles differently than the edges?? They are slightly smushed... </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T16:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a7180abf31f0d1fba5d7f7593a59f513.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IainWinter"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
