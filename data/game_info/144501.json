Each baby wants to shoot down the other baby in the room by throwing bear toys or when they drink too much milk they can use their diapers as a weapon. There isn't a place a small child cannot reach. There isn't a law of physics a small child cannot break. With his toys too.</p><p>Controls (Players 1 / Player 2):</p><ul><li>Move Left: A / Left </li><li>Move Right: D / Right </li><li>Hold to Throw: W / Up </li><li>Change Weapon: S / Down </li><li>Menu/Pause: Esc</li></ul><p>Game crated by:</p><ul><li>Norbert B\u0142aszczyk</li><li>Krzysztof Dziembowski</li><li>Marta Osowicz</li><li>Ryszard Tropisz</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e387bfca62ac856e93312cbd7d9408b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sergeant_pl"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
