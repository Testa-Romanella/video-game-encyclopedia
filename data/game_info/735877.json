{"id": 735877, "slug": "remnants-of-the-past", "name": "Remnants Of The Past", "name_original": "Remnants Of The Past", "description": "<p>A story influenced by the Guanche culture where you will navigate a fantasy world and face the destiny that the gods have chosen for you and your loved ones.\r\n</p>\n<p>But what\u2019s so special about your soul? I guess we will find out soon enough, won\u2019t we?</p>\n\n<strong>Synopsis</strong>\n<p>It\u2019s already been ten years since demons began to ravage the world, leaving broken families and shattered dreams in their wake. People pray to the gods and beg for help, but they remain silent and ignore all prayers.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, when fate causes the beasts of hell to knock on the doors of the humble town where you live, you discover that the gods have a plan, and that plan includes you. What would you be willing to give in exchange for ending the cycle of corruption and regain peace?\r\n</p>\n<p>One life for another. Your soul for theirs.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Warning</strong>\n<p>This is a\u00a0<strong>+18</strong> <strong>story </strong>and it contains violence, blood, swearing, optional sex scenes, and deals with serious topics such as depression and death.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Features</strong>\n<ul><li>Choose to be a man, a woman (cis or trans), or a non-binary person.\r\n</li><li>Choose your combat style (sword, bow or magic).\r\n</li><li>Choose your profession (guard, doctor, builder or tavern keeper). Depending on the job you choose, you will have specific scenes in the future, and your relationship with one of the main characters will be higher at the beginning than with the rest.\r\n</li><li>Build and maintain strong friendships with your companions, or flirt with them and start a romantic relationship that will last until the end of days.\r\n</li><li>You can flirt with just one or with all of them at once, but beware, they are all monogamous. Your actions have consequences and there will be broken hearts and lost friendships if you are not careful.\r\n</li><li>Special CGs.\r\n</li></ul>\n<strong>Love Interests</strong>\n<p>Remnants Of The Past includes four romantic options.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leire, the guard.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Since you arrived to the town and became one of the guards of Sorrol if you choose so, she has been your partner, and much, <em>much </em>later, your friend.\r\n</p>\n<p>Extremely introverted, serious and somewhat irascible, but brave and protective of those she loves. A very good person even though she has quite a temper when she\u2019s on duty.\r\n</p>\n<p>She grew up in Sorrol with her older brother, the most important person to her.\r\n</p>\n<p>Be careful if you hurt her brother in any way. She will never forget it.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ada, the doctor.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>She is the best doctor Sorrol has ever had. Well\u2026 the best and the only one apart from you, if you choose so. Before she arrived, the sick had to travel a long distance to the nearest hospital.\r\n</p>\n<p>A very friendly person. Maybe too friendly sometimes. And a huge flirt.\r\n</p>\n<p>Although she\u2019s been your friend for so many years, the only thing you know about her past is that she comes from Astian.\r\n</p>\n<p>Why did she decide to leave the comfort and luxury of the most important city of Thaon and move to a little town lost in the countryside? That\u2019s still a mystery.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Albert, the builder.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s one of the best builders of Sorrol. Most of the buildings exist thanks to him.\r\n</p>\n<p>He is also a great friend of yours. The first welcoming and friendly face you saw when you arrived many years ago.\r\n</p>\n<p>A sweet and kind person who cares about everyone he has contact with. Although sometimes he worries too much for nothing, and too often he underestimate himself and his abilities.\r\n</p>\n<p>He grew up in Sorrol with his little sister, whom he\u2019s been taking care of since demons killed their parents.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rayco, the tavern keeper.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>He\u2019s the owner of Tamarant, the tavern of the village, and technically, your boss if you choose so. Although he hates when you use that word. To him, you are his partner. Two friends running a business.\r\n</p>\n<p>But even though you\u2019ve known him for more than 7 years, there\u2019s still a lot you don\u2019t know. For his accent, you believe that he comes from another continent.\u00a0 And even though he has shared a little of his culture, he\u2019s never gotten into details.\r\n</p>\n<p>Maybe he doesn\u2019t remember, since he\u2019s been living in Sorrol for a very long time. Or perhaps he doesn\u2019t want to.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Things you should know</strong>\n<ul><li>This is a WIP. The story is very long and what I am sharing is only the first draft. With time I could edit chapters that I have already published, changing some scenes or deleting them completely if I think it\u2019s the best.\r\n</li><li>Some backgrounds and character sprites are temporary and will change in the future.\r\n</li><li>The default language is English, however, it is not my mother tongue and there will be grammatical errors. I would really appreciate if you let me know when see any so I can fix it.\r\n</li><li>I currently don't have a schedule for updates, but there should be a new chapter every few months. However, keep in mind that I am only one person, and therefore, the time between updates can vary greatly depending on the length of the chapter, if there are any CGs that I have to draw and their complexity, and personal problems I may have in real life.\r\n</li></ul>\n<strong>Contact</strong>\n<p>If you want to contact me you can do it in the following ways:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Tumblr (@remnants-of-the-past-vn or\u00a0@domakir)\r\n</li><li>Instagram (@domakir)\r\n</li><li>Gmail: ddomakir[at]gmail[dot]com</li><li>Twitter: @Domakir</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-07T07:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f13/f13c75dda3c53a43511b7f0731e6a097.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Domakir"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
