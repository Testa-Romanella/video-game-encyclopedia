They even did most of the sound! I only did the programming and offered guidance. <br/><br/>You only get one bow, and one blaster! <br/><br/>Use the arrow keys to move and jump, ducking also blocks with your shield. Vines on walls can be climbed. Press space to fire your laser blaster, or C to fire your bow &amp; arrow. Be careful! You have a limited number of arrows. You can find more arrows in chests. <br/><br/>You can also press P to pause. <br/><br/>Please note that the second level can take quite a bit of time to load; please be patient! Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9ee00ed5221d2655a9ae36bb0c1c11b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["STVR"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
