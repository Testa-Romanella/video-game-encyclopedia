Was it another one of his travels gone wrong? Did he hit his head?</p>\n<p>All left to do is explore Manta Island, talk to the residents of Mermaid village, explore the ruins of this island, and try to find a way out, while figuring out how he got there to begin with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Could it be related to Ganon or Zelda in any way?</p>\n<p>______________________</p>\n<p>This is an action-adventure game, zelda-style, with puzzles to be solved and a mystery to be revealed. Inspired by the zelda games on gbc, but having a new twist on the way that the story and exploration are presented.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T01:28:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b1050828e4bd0f1bd0acf21c7476009f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richterwilker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
