Collect all the expansion orbs to open the end of level portal- but act fast, because the void is closing in on you! More information can be found on the\u00a0Ludum Dare page. One other thing- it's ok to go into the void a little bit, the void can only kill you if your entire hitbox is submerged in it. Enjoy! And if you have a Ludum dare account, please leave your feedback on\u00a0the Ludum Dare page! This game is only available on windows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea4/ea4bf4d29725e988bf4d9b62ee604998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Purrfexionator"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
