You can select adjacent cards (up/down, left/right or diagonally) but\u00a0only\u00a0from the bottom three rows.\u00a0 Where there are cards still to be dealt they\u00a0will be added to the columns in the same order the matching pairs were selected.\u00a0Cards can\u00a0be discarded\u00a0to the bottom of the remaining deck, but only while there are cards still remaining on the discard pile although this will cost you a move (as will making a wrong selection, but you can cancel a selection by clicking on the card a second time and this will not be counted as a move). The number of unturned cards remaining on the deck is shown, and the discard pile will turn red when you are down to the last two cards - use your next moves wisely!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun . . .\u00a0</p>\n<p>Andy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T16:14:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0be/0bee7e6bdcd49a6cee79de7ef04bded0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Andy Douglas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
