The strategy lies in the fact that you can place pieces over your opponent's to block their pathways. You have a limited number of pieces that have their own strengths and weaknesses, so you must plan ahead and build reactively to your opponent. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can either play online via Steam invite or locally on one computer.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T03:04:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f689667fffd6bd6a157c6b5bbf9b6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan Deguzman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Jonathan Deguzman"], "esrb_rating": null}
