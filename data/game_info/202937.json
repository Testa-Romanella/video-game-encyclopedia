There isn't any sound right now, not that the game really needs it, but once i get better at sound engineering or find a sound engineer i fully intend to add music and maybe a few object sounds. The game should save a high score automatically upon game-over. if you find any bugs please contact me so i can fix them.</p><p>updates*</p><p>added music to menus</p><p>added sound effects to buttons</p><p>added main game music</p><p>fixed pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8b/b8b782e542e941057bf3b52eff5d1b03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Transdimensional Tardigrade"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
