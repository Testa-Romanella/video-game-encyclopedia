RECESS!!! Find the wallet or die hungry!!! Remember \"ROTATE\" around to find your wallet.</p>\n\n<p>Game Idea/ Concept:</p>\n<p>International Cardboard School is a game that is created within 3 days of the Global Game Jam 2021. The theme for the game jam was Lost and Found.</p>\n<p>The main idea of the game is to utilize the perspective to hide objects. There are objects which cannot be seen until the world is rotated to different perspective. Besides that, we also wants to use a 2D-looking environment in a 3D world space which is why the characters and assets are 2D and arranged in a way that it looks 3D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T05:37:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b51a8afa7c555cffc810b003bf85e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sit"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
