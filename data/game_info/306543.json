There are a few critters to talk to and an angel to play cards with.</p>\n<p>You can use wasd and arrow keys to walk around, Z or left click to interact, X or right click to <strong>Button 2(Speed Text),</strong> and Q&amp;E to rotate the camera. F toggles screen effects. And you can hold down escape to quit.</p>\n<p>You could probably play this for about 15 minutes, I don't mind.</p>\n<p>Using\u00a0arachonteur's psychic swamp tileset.</p>\n<p>Also using Jamie Rollo's MeshEdit.</p>\n<p>And KaiClavier's Super Text Mesh.</p>\n<p>Font is Silkscreen.</p>\n<p>Music by rotseraph.
