Theme was 'find the target'.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I originally finished the game within the 3 hour window at 2hrs 44mins, but after uploading it and a few other people having a go it became apparent that it was too common for someone to win with their first shot due to RNG. So I used my last fifteen minutes to tweak a few variables and the size of some prefabs and now it is less likely (but still possible!) to win with literally your first shot.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>The 'v1.1' files uploaded here are the tweaked builds. </em><br/></p>\n<p>Controls: A/D or left arrow/right arrow to rotate</p>\n<p>Spacebar: Fire the cannon!<br/></p>\n<p>Simple enough premise: You control a cannon and your target is somewhere hidden in the darkness around you, surrounded by obstacles. When you fire you will see the trajectory of your cannonball and where it bounces off things, with each bounce leaving behind a colour coded indicator. Green is close, yellow not as close, orange further and red farthest.</p>\n<p>Music is 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home' by Cooper Cannell from YouTube Audio Library.</p>\n<p>The cannon firing sound effect is also from YouTube audio library, credited as 'Gunshot and echo long'</p>\n<p>All other SFX (two of them!) are 'foley' work by me. Namely, putting a battery into my electric drill and hitting the bottom of my wok with a wooden spoon :)</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for a playing my game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T09:42:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfe/dfe02a54af44d725ec233a675239615c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ScotchCarb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
