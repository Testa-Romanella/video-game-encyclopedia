Head DEEPER AND DEEPER through the arcade games to escape. Think of it like Inception, but instead of dreams it's games. And instead of a complicated plot there's no plot at all!</p>\n<p>You can press R at any time to reset a level.</p>\n<p>There is a bit of an issue with interaction in the 3D areas.
