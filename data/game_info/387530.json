The idea was to create a kind of virtual museum for people to discover my artworks in a more engaging and funny way. All the collages and sculptures to be seen across the island are my own creations, and the creatures that populate it are mostly rejects from another unfinished art videogame project. I thought it was a shame that those little monsters disappeared forever, so I gave them this second life. Initially, I planned on including more interactions to gamify the visit a bit. Maybe I will someday.\u00a0 I'll try and upload a VR version too !</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p>\n<p>WASD or arrows + mouse<br/></p>\n<p>F to toggle flashlight<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T04:03:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f0/0f09c8866270f053e32689a466354354.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stabeor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
