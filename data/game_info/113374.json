It's going to be centered around four key types of puzzles:</p><p>-Logic Gate Puzzles</p><p>-World Looping Puzzles (inspired by the game Manifold Garden)</p><p>-Light beam Puzzles</p><p>-Portal puzzles<br/><br/>It's also a prototype in terms of artwork, as I am going for an abstract style. The idea is to have 4 different worlds, each with their own artstyle:</p><p>-Gardens</p><p>-Full Abstract (black and white)</p><p>-Sunken cities</p><p>-City (Vaporwave style)<br/></p><p>11/03/2017 Update:<br/></p><p>We are still up and running, by the way. Making levels, making progress! Couple of screenshots of new levels were added!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71df02f7725622b5a9f9ce57529e4244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xangotrick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
