{"id": 472358, "slug": "endless-azure", "name": "Endless Azure", "name_original": "Endless Azure", "description": "Endless Azure is a wonderful game for those who love planes, blue seas, and Mediterranean islands. It will appeal to everyone who enjoys relaxing games, but particularly  those who love vintage seaplanes.<br/>Imagine an early twentieth century where you carry express mail and packages across the endless azure seas of the Mediterranean in a fully customized Schneider trophy aircraft.  You\u2019ll fly the tranquil skies of Southern Europe where you pick up and drop off packages. Each drop will earn you credits, needed to upgrade the racing machine of your dreams. But you\u2019ll have to keep an eye out for the competition who\u2019ll snap packages up right before your eyes! <br/>You can keep flying past endless island chains, or go to the hangar to tinker with your plane. New colors for your racer will be available as pickups. Need more speed? Endless Azure allows you to upgrade all plane components. These parts are meticulously created from the original Schneider Trophy racers. You can complete the historically accurate classic race planes you know and love, or create your very own vintage aircraft design!<br/>The game also features an Azure mode, which takes the pressure off the gameplay for even more relaxed flying. You can just zone out as you fly into the blue yonder.<br/><br/>The Schneider Trophy planes have been an inspiration for over a century, and L2GX hopes Endless Azure can bring some of that nostalgia to you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3a/b3a082ec801e1a175e6a8e81a53eb763_M6gRVRj.jpg", "website": "http://www.l2gx.net/endlessazure/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Paul Van Rompaye"], "genres": ["Racing", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Paul Van Rompaye"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
