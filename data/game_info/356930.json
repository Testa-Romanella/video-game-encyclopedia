As a Gunner you have 12 types of Primary weapons and 6 types of Secondary weapons for your space turret that will help you to do the job.<br/>Bullets for Primary weapons are unlimited, but each shot will cost you a score point.<br/>Secondary weapons are limited in ammo, so shoot it sanely.<br/>During intensive firing the primary weapon might overheat and misfire; the temperature gauge that indicates overheating is located under the ammo counter. <br/><br/>There are two game play modes: Gunner Campaign and Gunner Survival; each with 32 levels will not leave you indifferent and will not let you get bored in this shooting game.<br/><br/>LEADERBOARDS, ACHIEVEMENT, CLOUD SAVE.<br/><br/>Find out more about Warlock Studio:<br/>http://www.warlockstudio.com<br/><br/>Follow Warlock Studio on Twitter:<br/>http://www.twitter.com/warlockstudio<br/><br/>Follow Warlock Studio on Facebook:<br/>http://www.facebook.com/warlockstudio<br/><br/>Follow Warlock Studio on YouTube:<br/>http://www.youtube.com/warlockstudio<br/><br/>Have any problems or suggestions?
