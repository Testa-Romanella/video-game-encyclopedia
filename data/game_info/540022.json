The prison administration has noticed lately that some prisoners, who really like to eat a lot, can hardly walk through different doors, including those of their own cells. The administration cannot reduce their food allowance as it would violate the prisoners\u2019 rights. So it was decided to gather such prisoners and arrange a soccer game between them so as to make them lose some calories. It produced the desired effect, and the prisoners did lose some calories, but they are still unable to fit in the doors. So this time, a hockey game will be played.<br/>\r\nEach team consists of three players. Your have to score as many goals in the opponent\u2019s net as you can in order to win the match. There are no rules, and you can even hit the players of your opponent\u2019s team.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T02:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/748/7483b1c29dc34df65d4d640526befea0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Biscuit Play"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Biscuit Play"], "esrb_rating": null}
