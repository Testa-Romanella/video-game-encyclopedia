I am very proud of this project as it took me a long time to get a lot of the game aspects working as it was my first time making something completely from scratch in Unreal Engine 4. The biggest struggle I had was getting the ball to go forward in the same direction the camera was turned, but after relentless searching and tweaking, I managed to get it to move the exact way I wanted it to.</p>\n\n<p>The objective of the game is to collect as many rings as you possibly can before reaching the goal at the end. The player has the power to boost, which is refreshed over time, or instantly refreshed after collecting a ring. This can lead to big chain boosts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01e/01ec45ba74b663157bbb9dd5768be5ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolarSnowball"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
