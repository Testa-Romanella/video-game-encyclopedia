Jump over ditches and fences, don't jump over grass. Following these rules will increase your score.\u00a0</p>\r\nCommentary\r\n<p>Another project-heavy month - I actually finished a GodotEngine game, but it was basically their tutorial game so probably not worth sharing. Also Pride here was right at the end of the month and that took a lot of time out of games stuff. So I tried to be kind to myself and let this slip into the grace period, and I feel good for doing it. Pretty happy with the cow sprite, the others aren't my favourite work but they serve pretty fine. Please enjoy!</p>\n<p>Lexaloffle BBS thread:\u00a0here.</p>\n<p>#1GAM June 2018</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/338/33858e642142d0c9b501cb49c0b101f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["PROGRAM_IX"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
