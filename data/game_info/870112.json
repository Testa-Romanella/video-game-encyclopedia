All of them. At the same time.</strong> They have isolated many citizens out on the street to feast upon them!\u00a0Your goal is, to rescue as many citizens as possible!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>If you manage to rescue 100 citizens, you win!</strong><br/>But take care! The more people you have rescued the higher the weight of the helicopter is. It gets more and more difficult to stay in the air and not crash into the ground!</p>\n<p>Oh... Take a look at the <strong>how-to-play</strong> screenshot or open the how-to-play in-game before you start!<br/></p>\n<p>We were a team of 3 for this game - one designer, two developers.</p>\n<p>Have fun!<br/>Cheers, Gris</p>\n<p>PS: All assets that we did not make ourselves are credited in-game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T07:55:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79d/79d26e03e97c700f91098e9cd93b62cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grisgram"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
