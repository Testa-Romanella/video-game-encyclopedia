{"id": 551543, "slug": "follow-the-whispers", "name": "Follow The Whispers", "name_original": "Follow The Whispers", "description": "<p>Follow The Whispers is a third-person puzzle spooky game. The player, Boody, is a little child who is terrified of darkness. He has an old flashlight in his possession that dies quickly and needs batteries often. Through exploring the surroundings (opening cupboards, doors, etc) he finds keys, some of which can be used to open doors. He starts by opening his room and exploring the surroundings, he notices that there are souls that roam the house but are easily repelled by the flashlight. However, if the batteries are out the souls spook Boody, and he can't help but scream for help. He recognizes that there is a housemistress who often checks the house to make sure that everything and everyone is in place; if she walks into Boody she will force him back into his room. She uses a big fire torch to see her surroundings despite the darkness. Boody must be very careful not to make a sound. He also realizes far away screams that belong to someone he knows. He decides to check every corner of the house and risk being noticed by the ghosts and housemistress to save whoever is screaming and leave the house.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c7d4c5655b34b83fa044984a25377c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["saddest_potatoes"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
