It is based on her earlier work <em>Forever Wings</em>, a 2010\u20132012 webcomic hosted on Smack Jeeves about Rollo and her friends on <em>Mabinogi</em>, a 2004 MMORPG published by Nexon.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    The word \"Flash\" may tip you off as to what this page might be for, and indeed\u2014<strong>this is a Ren'Py port of all 21 parts currently available of FWR.</strong> \"Currently available\" should also tell to you that, yes, FWR is a currently incomplete series.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    It's not news to anyone that the long-running decline of Flash would put off most people from touching it, consumers and creators alike\u2014it is for that very reason that FWR is unfinished.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    Of course, it's not like the visual novel itself is gone. It's only inaccessible through <em>web browsers</em>. You can go on the DeviantArt pages for each part and download the .swf files yourself to run in a desktop version of Flash Player\u2014it's what I did myself.\r\n</p>\r\nPort:\r\n<p>\r\n    To compete with that, this port offers a few features not found in the original. They're mostly here just by porting it over to Ren'Py: volume &amp; text speed control, save &amp; loading, proper skip functionality, rollback, and fullscreen support*.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    For newer features, there's a scene select which allows you to revisit previously completed parts and proceed to the next available part without having to reread from the start. There's also a few unlockable features at the end that I hope you'll enjoy.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n(*The game's resolution is 850x600. It doesn't scale up very nicely for bigger monitors but the sprites tend to look good since they were drawn at bigger resolutions.)\r\n</p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p>\r\n    As for the visual novel's story itself, it's inspired by the likes of <em>Higurashi When They Cry</em>, where FWR takes place in a small town with boring mysteries in which one elf girl arriving seems to upend the normality\u2014and the mysteries.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    The excerpt on this page should also hint to you how this visual novel is told\u2014our four particularly abnormal individuals all serve their time as the story's narrators, in which relationships and mysteries unfold wonderfully as you switch perspectives. It's a chance to look at your own reflection and realize the multitudes you and yours yet contain.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n    As Rollo best puts it, \"This is a love story, this is a horror story.\"\r\n</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Story and Characters by CinnamonRollo\r\n<ul><li>\r\nAlso on Twitter and Tumblr.\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Art by three-legged-cow (bradbradleyart)\r\n<ul><li>\r\nAlso on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Ren'Py port by Brimbel</li>\n</ul>\r\nDisclaimers:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Made with permission.
