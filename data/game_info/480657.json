Collect gears to buy your repairs and upgrades at the Pit Stops! However, the police are chasing you because you're stealing all of their gears!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Mouse - Control camera</p>\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n<p>Left click - Boost</p>\n<p>Right click - Plant mines, 1.5 second cool down</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>The goal is to get to the golden gear, but\u00a0<strong>you need to upgrade your ship first!\u00a0</strong>Get at least the JUMP and BOOST upgrades that cost 10 gears each. But also try out the mines, they're pretty cool.</p>\n\n<p>Your ship also breaks a bit if you run into things a lot, so spend 5 gears in the pit stop to repair your ship and gain some health back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:25:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c94123f273ed741f30b2d78a3a568356.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fiona Soetrisno"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
