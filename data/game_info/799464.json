In this version the cards are features of the RedwoodJS framework https://redwoodjs.com\u00a0When you get a match a little info card will pop up telling you more about it. If you don't care about Redwood, or when playing it for the 10th time, you can disable the cards in the menu!</p>\n<p><strong>How to Install</strong></p>\n<p>If you already have a Playdate you're probably familiar with sideloading games. But even if you don't have a Playdate you can still play! Install the SDK and then just double click the .pdx file to start.</p>\n<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T06:13:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01c/01c58920e456123f1fef458fcfa86f26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cannikinn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
