The challenge of the game is that you cannot let the ring touch the maze. If it does, it's game over.</p>\n<p>I took\u00a0 this game concept and added more ideas to showcase what is possible in VR.\u00a0 These ideas are mostly mechanics taken from existing platformer games like moving obstacles or physics based\u00a0 puzzles.\u00a0</p><p>This is a very early version of the game, only has 5 levels and may contain a lot of bugs.</p>\n<p>This was supposed to be just a quick project but I loved the idea even more after playtesting it, so I've decided to continue development and add more features soon!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing and let me know if you have any thoughts\u00a0 \u00a0or suggestions! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T06:26:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ab/5abdf3a867370218ba5cd691762c4603.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["roydadivas"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
