A shape is either a single square containing a straight line or 90\u00b0 corner or a combination of multiple such squares. The player must then try to make loops out of them. Once a loop is completed, all pieces involved will disappear.<br/>Become Loopz's Master and\u00a0Catch Bonus, and avoid penalty to make more an more Loops.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T16:01:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/61a/61acdacfde466dcf1e5da3829219be08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thyphoon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
