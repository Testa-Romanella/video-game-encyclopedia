Your turtle auto-moves and you basically just have to fly and shield.\u00a0In addition, you can slow down or dash to better avoid or reach things. I hope that with these 4 abilities, the player can develop different technics to get an edge over his opponent.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard mode:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Controller mode:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In controller mode,\u00a01 player can also join with the keyboard.<br/></p>\n<p>Use player 2 controls of keyboard mode for in game inputs.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Tech:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Stun:</strong> shield while stomping the other player to stun him.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Bounce: </strong>slowing down while hitting the other player or an obstacle will make you bounce twice as far as a regular bounce, letting you reach things behind you.</p>\n<p><strong>Shield bump:</strong> if you shield right after a dash, your shell will perfom a quick jump.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Shield bump:</strong> if you're slowing down and you shield right after a dash, your shell will perform a lateral jump that goes higher then the regular shield bump.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dev notes:</strong></p>\n<p>Let me know in the comment\u00a0whether you enjoyed it or not and\u00a0if there is something you would like to see in a future update. Something about the UI and navigation could be more intuitive but\u00a0I think the game is enjoyable in this state. I hope to release it on Switch eventually.</p>\n\n<p>@j3d.art\u00a0on instagram to follow my work.<br/></p>\n\n<p>note: MAC build might not work with the built-in unzip tool. Try a third party\u00a0unzip program, let me know how it goes.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d16/d16aea7acdc3c0352ee4fac95cbda83e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["jeremiegb"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
