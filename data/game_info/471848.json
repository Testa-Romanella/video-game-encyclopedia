Marching Cubes is a puzzle game where you are limited by the amount if inputs you have. That's also the play on the theme \"Out of Control\".</p>\n<p>The game features 5 tutorial levels, and a level editor to make custom levels. Due to the fact that i am working solo, i have called it here since i do really need some sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There may still be some bugs, i haven't found out yet. If you encounter any, please let me know and i will look into hotfixing it.</p>\n<p>Sound effects used are from a pack i bought a while ago, and i used a few assets from Kenney (such as the door and the flag). The rest of the assets are made during this jam.</p>\n\n<p>Note. Project was entirely made in HDRP, and i found out at the last minute that HDRP does not support WEBGL, so i made a rushed switch to URP. That's why the screenshots look slightly different than the final game (with main difference being more bloom).\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Bugs noted:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Star rating system being totally broken - STATUS: fixed but still not great.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T05:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa2/fa294b622b48e52c485141ceb53066ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MoreMagical"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
