It was the first time I worked entirely on my own during a jam. When I started, I already had a clear vision of what the game should look like while I only had relatively vague ideas on how it should be played. It turned out that building a vertical maze in a setting that doesn't actually allow players to see the vertical walls makes for quite a challenge, so the game's design kept evolving: The differently colored windows provided a convenient solution for both separating rooms on the same floor and giving players more agency.</p>\n<p>The published version of the game received some further polishing, including two additional levels and full in-game credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T02:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90ccbc36a0bdd2bc5ecc15866870175.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Marius M\u00fchleck"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
