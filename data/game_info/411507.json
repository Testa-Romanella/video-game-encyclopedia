Its origin was to be a 4 person survival horror experience that evolves into a wave-based survival zombie game.</p>\n<p>The game evolved to be a time-based zombie first-person shooter as the original scope was way outside of the bounds of us so we decided to make a playable arcade mode of zombies that has evolved to be the main game. The player is dropped on a road in the woods where they can explore the surrounding areas,\u00a0seeing\u00a0how long they can survive from the zombie onslaught.</p>\n\n<p>Developers: Samuel Wilson, Daniel Foyle, Byron Andrew-Salvietto<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-10T04:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f34/f348b61cece0617de176668a116b84fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samuel Wilson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
