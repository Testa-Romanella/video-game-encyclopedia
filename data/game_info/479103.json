But each attemt is recorded on a different player. <strong>Players </strong>need to interact with <strong>eachother </strong>in order to complete the game. New instances are created by going to the past <em><strong>(Rewinding).</strong></em></p>\n<p>This game was made for the<strong> Brackeys Game Jam</strong> so bugs can appear. I have tested every single level and they are all possible to finish. Some are harded some are easier. For best experience I suggest completing at least 10 first levels. They are the easiest and explain the game mechanics. 10 - 20 are for the true\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<strong>G A M E R S\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&gt;:)</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game. You can check out the controls in the main menu.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>TIPS</em></strong></p>\n<p>The<strong> recording system might not be perfect</strong>. For best results in more difficult and precise levels don't use the fast forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't skip the level on the count down</strong> it will bug the game out! Wait until your character can move.</p><p>On my device game starts with 11 levels unlocked. They shouldn't be! (<em>Its a bug with Player Prefs pradobly :( </em>) Idk if anyone else also have them unlocked. Just ignore that and plat the first ones because starting from level 11 isn't a smart idea :/</p>\n<p>I highlt suggest <strong>downloading a standalone build</strong> for Windows / Mac / Linux. Game looks a bit better and pradobly could run better than in borwser. But playing in browser is fine no features missing :)</p>\n<p><strong>Don't close the game in the Browser</strong> you can but it just disables it. You can refresh the page though.</p>\n<p><strong><em>LINKS</em></strong></p>\n<p>My YouTube -\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxSKvAiwvK41SCQ24Cj2cw?view_as=subscriber<strong>\u00a0(devlog soon)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:29:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19e/19efc1dd357ec90dc9f2ad6716a10138.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Xenon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
