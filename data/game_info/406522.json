There is an official ending and you can adjust the volume to the music with the side bar.\u00a0 All art and story are\u00a0original and created by me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The background track is \"chocolate\" produced by Lukrembo. It is copyright-free and available for commercial use.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever created with twine and 0 knowledge about programming. I made this in a span of a week to play around with mechanics so it's pretty basic in concept but I hope you enjoy it nevertheless. Feel free to donate if you like it and fuel my motivation to make more games.</p>\n<p>If you want to follow me, check out my twitter @Mishatventures!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:48:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e53/e53040885f6456d08290d927a38324c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mishatventures"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
