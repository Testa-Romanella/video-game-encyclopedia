MOUSA (Mouse NASA) has discovered \"there's cheese up there! And it's just sitting out free for the taking, no packaging or nothin'.\" Bravely go where no mouse has gone and collect all the cheese detected in the vicinity of the landing site.</p>\n<p>Scour the area and look or dig for cheese with the help of your CFR (Cheese Finding Radar). The faster the pings the closer you are to that sweet sweet rat gold. Be fast though! MOUSA didn't have much funding for your suit after pouring all their mouse money into building the sick rocket that got you to the moon, so you only have 3 minutes of mouse oxygen to find all the cheese.</p>\n<p>Use W, A, S, and D to move</p>\n<p>Use your Mouse :) to look around</p>\n<p>Press the Left Mouse Button to dig</p>\n<p>Press the E Button to collect cheese</p>\n<p>________________<br/></p><p>Cheddar Hunt is a treasure-hunting game I made for my Design of Virtual Game Environments class. You play as a mouse searching for cheese in a low-gravity environment. Finding cheese is done by a hot and cold style pinging sound. The closer to the cheese you are, the faster the pings.</p>\n<p>Cheddar Hunt was made with Unreal Engine 4. The 2D sprites were made in Adobe Photoshop, and most of the 3D shapes were royalty-free models found online.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T06:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d91cfeedc3e2ea179d1922fee9b5d5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magical-pal"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
