It's extremely simple, just get to the flag. The twist? Oh do it again, but this time it'll be harder. Then do it again, and again, and again. How much harder is it you ask? That's up to the computer to decide</p>\r\nConcept:\r\n<p>Again is a 2D platformer game, where the goal is to get to the flag. Once you get to the flag though, you can replay the level, and a (sort of) random addition will be added. Currently there are only 5 random additions, which are spikes (certain areas in the level will have spikes), monsters (like spikes, but they will switch between docile and aggressive in a constant interval), bombs (A literal rocket/bomb shoots at you), upsidedown (upsidedown camera and controls) , and mirror (mirrored camera and controls). This means that the entire level can have 32 unique states.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game includes three diversifier provided by the CSUI Individual Game Jam of 2020:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>Save Me\u00a0</strong>(Implement a save/load)\r\nFor each extra addition to a level you can pass, a medal will be given. This medal is the max amount of additions you passed in a single playthrough of the level. This is saved throughout play sessions.</li><li><strong>Dentuman</strong>\u00a0(Implement SFX which signals a certain event will happen) I added a soundover of me saying the different additions when they are added. Yup its my voice (edited of course)</li><li><strong>A Whole New World (</strong>Every respawn is a new world) Well sort of, since when you replay the level (after getting to the flag) a new addition is added which changes the level and how to beat it.</li></ol>\n\r\nAssets used:\r\n<p>Sprites, Animations:</p>\n<ul><li>Medals by Buch</li><li>Pixel Slime by\u00a0rvros</li><li>Spaceship Sprite by Tavino</li></ul>\n<p>Background Music:</p>\n<p>Music by Eric Matyas</p>\n<p>www.soundimage.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:09:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f3a3e85d9ed6b4d2b0b002dca7283d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zafirr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
