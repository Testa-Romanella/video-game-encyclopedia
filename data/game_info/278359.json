But something goes wrong inside the fortified walls of his laboratories. Some of those mutated creations have other plans for Dr. Krankenheit.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Krankenheit is a first person shooter set in a dark, sci-fi world, where you play the role of a silent humanoid mutant that escaped from the laboratories of the evil scientist that held it captive. Inspired by old-school classics, the minimalist polygonal art and fast paced gunfights aim to create a\u00a0fun and challenging game\u00a0without making the mistake of\u00a0being retro for retro's sake.</p>\n<p>Krankenheit currently\u00a0features:</p>\n<ul><li>4 enemy types that you can slice, blow up, and riddle with bullets,</li><li>5 different\u00a0weapons, each with its own strengths and weaknesses,</li><li>A large, secret-filled level that takes 30 to 60 minutes to beat on a blind playthrough.</li></ul>\n<p>The game is currently in early-access, meaning that it's still being developed, and might be unstable, but by purchasing it now, you will get access to all future updates, including the final release. While we don't like the idea of\u00a0selling an unfinished product, your purchases will allow us to keep working on the game and get you the best gosh darn game we're capable of making!</p>\n<p>You can also check out our twitter account for more updates;\u00a0https://twitter.com/krankenheitgame</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/850/850255ae11e1a57021e0ad64b6755059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["David Jalbert"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
