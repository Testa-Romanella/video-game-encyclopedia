{"id": 685763, "slug": "pewpew-5", "name": "Pew[pew]", "name_original": "Pew[pew]", "description": "<p>Pew[pew] is a bullet-hell\u00a0/ Space shooter game where you try to survive and get as many points as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game differentiates itself from others in the genre by its controls. Use spacebar to gain thrust in the direction of your mouse pointer, the ship will then float in that direction until you thrust in another direction. It takes some time to get used to, but the point is to add more skillcap to the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I created the game soly to get to know the Godot game engine, but if you found this, downloaded and played it, I would LOVE to hear your feedback. The music and soundeffects I found in a humble bundle a while back, so those are not of my creation, otherwise its all me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Also, please add a comment with your highest score. Maybe there could be a competition in the comments? :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:05:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b5c8ceb72a3a381353c1fb13f03adf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PojoSWE"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
