You are racing in an infinite tunnel, avoiding obstacles, trying to stay near to the purple energy rail so as to refill your energy bar. If you hit an obstacle - you explode. If you run out of power - you explode. Test your reflexes as you advance through the tunnel by maneuvering past deviously placed blocks designed to make you flip, slide and rotate sideways. Try to do a honorable score and your name will be written forever on the on-line leaderboard. Don't give up and try again. Have fun.</p>\n<p>Use left&amp;right arrows (or WA keys) to move your purple cube ++</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b629741625339c4c39c651ee6919d401.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
