{"id": 120772, "slug": "stoneblade", "name": "Stoneblade", "name_original": "Stoneblade", "description": "<p>Stoneblade is a puzzle game heavily inspired by Tetris. Instead of trying to complete a row, the aim in Stoneblade is to bunch up 1x1 and 1x2 blocks (or stones) and blow up as many as possible at once. The more are exploded at once using a golden sword, the more points you are rewarded. However, if you explode a bomb, you lose HP, and if your HP reaches 0, you lose. You can use copper swords to explode bombs and take less damage than you would otherwise using golden swords, but you get less points. To get as many points as possible you must carefully choose where to position your stones and bombs to then blow them up as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>This game includes...</strong></p>\n<ul><li>An incredible soundtrack composed by\u00a0Juhani Junkala</li><li>Intuitive graphics</li><li>Fleshed out game mechanics</li><li>A high score system so that you can compare yourself to your friends and see who is the ultimate <strong>Stoneblade</strong> champion ;)\u00a0</li></ul><p>(Special thanks to Sogomn for the awesome explosion animation!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f719ecb63c1fb0fb9aa47c54ab2e9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Conradical's Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
