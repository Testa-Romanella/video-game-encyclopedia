Needed something to work on in order not to start climbing walls and keep myself busy. Decided to revisit my Toriga game, as the computer I made this old project on is now unusable. Could I make it again from scratch, in a shorter amount of time, with a more robust code, and a better end result, quality-wise?</p>\n<p>This is the end result. It's quite fast-paced. Control scheme is better, I think. There are some pretty cool powerups you can try and combine with one another. Not putting any video at the moment cause I'm really crap at video editing.\u00a0I'm kinda satisfied with the game in the end, and I hope you'll enjoy it as well :)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>THE GAME:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>This is a quick and short 2d retro shmup game I coded on Gamemaker 2. Control scheme is simple: <strong>A/D</strong> or <strong>Q/D</strong>\u00a0to move, <strong>spacebar</strong> to shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Commissioned\u00a0ressources:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Sprites:</strong> Enemy spaceships by Quintin Stokes (https://qujast.wixsite.com/home)</li><li><strong>Sprites: </strong>Title graphic design by Vincent Vanh\u00e9e.</li><li><strong>Background:</strong> Space backgrounds by ansimuz (https://ansimuz.itch.io/)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Opengameart ressources:\r\n</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Audio:\u00a0</strong>Retro Game Music Pack, by Juhani Junkala (https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action).
