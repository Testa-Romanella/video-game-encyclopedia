The Player wins when ALL citizens have been murdered.</p>\n<p>As Mr.Heckyll the brutal killer, you are bound to be chased by the Policemen if you get too close to them OR you are seen murdering a citizen. If chased, you need to run to avoid them but you can also drink a Potion to transform into the innocent Dr.Jyde thus throwing the policement off the scent.</p>\n<p>Beware though, you only have enough Potion to transform into Dr.Jyde 3 times so use them sparingly.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>W, A, S, D / Up, Down, Left,\u00a0Right - Movement<br/>E - Murder (must stand near Citizen)<br/>Q - Drink Potion<br/></p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPMENT DUDES</strong></p>\r\nWho?DiscordRoleSocialsChris Lee Yi\r\n@Chris Ly\r\nProgrammer\r\nhttps://leemeoyi.itch.io/\r\nHong Yu\r\n@hongyu\r\nProgrammer\r\n\r\nJone Leong\r\n@JoneLeong\r\nProgrammer\r\nhttps://joneleong.itch.io/\r\nNah\r\n@Nah\r\nPixel Artist\r\n-N/A-Aidan\r\n@PixelFr0ggiePixel Artist\r\nhttps://pixelfr0ggie.itch.io/\r\nBrandon\r\n@Brandon\r\nComposer\r\nwingspahn@gmail.com\r\nYee I-Van\r\n@IVan\r\nDesigner\r\nIG: @thealchymyst", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T12:16:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd3e1a0734a4a0c5ec1285da1ccb94e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alchymyst", "JoneLeong"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
