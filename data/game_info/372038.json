I may, or may not, have taken the theme a\u00a0<em>tad</em> too literally, but hey, I think it's kinda fun, heh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my first Game Jam, so any and all criticism is welcome, as I'm trying to learn as much as possible from each project. I understand the game is a tad feature-lacking, but I would still appreciate it if you took the time to try it out and leave some comments on how it plays out!</p>\n<p>Credits: Tree and Mountain models were taken from Kenney's Nature Kit - asset pack.\u00a0https://www.kenney.nl/assets/nature-kit</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W A\u00a0S D -\u00a0movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - rotation of character and aim</p>\n<p>Mouse 1 - Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:53:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1b/c1b0df0dcdec98ae5e637288d48c4439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["shoppiboi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
