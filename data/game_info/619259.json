This version features a few levels and things the robot can be connected to.</p>\n<p>The next ideas that didn't have time for inclusion are adding more complex tunnels that the rope can slide through, more interaction between background and foreground and a few more different things to be connected to in the background, as well as cleaning up the physics, that have their issues in a number of cases. A more developed visual style would help make the whole thing more readable as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Music: In House by Rick Dickert, distributed on Melody Loops<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to Jump</p>\n<p>Shift to interact with the background</p>\n<p>R to reset level</p>\n<p>Esc to pause</p>\n<p>F to toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p>M/B/E to mute or unmute the game/music/sounds<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:02:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b1/5b1bfbe2cc9ea218ebf2eb7fdaddaa32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NorkasGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
