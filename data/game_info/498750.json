Alongside\u00a0the theme, we were given\u00a0a piece of artwork from the time containing a blimp in an aerial battle, which we had to base the game around.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Tap space - Jump/Fly (flappy bird style)</p>\n<p>Left mouse button\u00a0- Fire<br/></p>\n<p>R - Reload</p>\n<p>Esc - Pause</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Producer/Programmer - Semra Usanmaz -\u00a0https://semrausanmaz.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Main Programmer - Toni Popov -\u00a0https://toni1565.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer - George Irtelli</p>\n<p>Programmer - Oliver Smith -\u00a0https://oliver-smith.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Artist - Mariya Kushchyk</p>\n<p>Artist - Aleksandar Todorov</p>\n<p>Artist - Axada Rai</p>\n<p>UI Artist - Rhys Rose</p>\n<p>Audio + Logo creator - Nathan Stalley\u00a0</p>\n<p>Audio - Dan Gaby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a35edc055732a4cf52ab6cda31e8fc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toni Popov", "Oliver Smith", "Semra Usanmaz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
