I probably have 3 dozen plugins and assets from the Corona Marketplace and I thought a jam would be the perfect place to try to combine as many as possible to increase the quality of a 4-hour-coded app.</p><p>I started out with 8 plugins and several assets, making a playground where I could mash up the plugins in interesting ways.  I appreciated the challenging theme of \"Virtue\" and eventually the idea of cleanliness meets oral hygiene emerged.</p><p>I reached the 4-hour mark and thought I was jamming until I tried the app on device.  Then it was like a royal rumble of geeky treasures.  Terrain squared off against SSK, while Gesture and my Trig Engine combined forces to pummel any and all Android devices.  I probably could have tamed those beasts but not with my Dynamic Shader running in the background.  In the end, I was forced to drop Gesture and replace is with a more simple touch detection that was already part of my Trig Engine.  I got Terrain and SSK to declare a truce but not before spending another 2 hours coding.  So my grand total is between 6 and 7 hours depending on how loosely I define coding.<br/></p><p>Enjoy the game and keep those teeth clean!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/69563ead5dd94aa58e9810fd6ff4d1da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sporkfin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
