In Art Academy: Second Semester, new and returning students are \n      presented with another set of in-depth lessons designed to encourage the \n      creation of more complex artwork. By gaining an even deeper \n      understanding of colors and techniques used by famous impressionist \n      artists, you will be taking on more challenging themes that include \n      moving objects and vast landscapes with distant objects. Combined with \n      the openness of Free Paint mode, you\u2019ll find plenty of opportunities to \n      hone your skills and boost your confidence as an artist.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9c/f9cf89ba1671ac18b14af8d7eafdae14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
