By constructing structures on the various rings of the mining rig, power and precious materials can be harvested from the highly valuable Crystals.\r\n</p>\n<p>To harvest the Crystal, harvesting <strong>structures </strong>have to be built <strong>in clusters</strong> on the rig. The larger the chain of structures, the more resources those structures can harvest. Additionally, specialist <strong>workers </strong>can be employed to manually harvest materials from structures, useful for harvesting resources from isolated, non-clustered structures. Harvesting precious minerals allows the mining rig to be extended with additional rings.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, maintaining chains of structures is an on-going challenge. The rings of the mining rig rotate periodically, altering the layout of the mining rig. Structures need replacing periodically, and buildings cost a variety of resources.<br/><br/><strong>How to play<br/><br/></strong>If your POWER (Red) reaches 0, it's game over. MINERALS (Blue) are used to unlock new buildings and upgrade your rig. POPULATION (Green) allows you to play worker cards.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Place buildings adjacent to each other in order for them to harvest the crystal's resources or gain population. The longer the chain, the more resources that are awarded. Be aware of walls that are on the edges of some buildings, as they will block chains.<br/><br/>Place workers to manually work the buildings. This will allow you to harvest the building's resource without requiring a chain of adjacent buildings.\u00a0<br/><br/>The rings of the mining rig rotate periodically, track their next rotation on the UI top left. The Crystal grows unstable, and shoots out flares periodically.\u00a0This will destroy buildings.<br/><br/>Special buildings can be built, which enhance harvesting, impact ring rotation, or prevent the Crystal's flare from destroying buildings.\u00a0<br/><br/>Earn enough precious minerals to unlock new buildings and additional rings for your mining rig.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Critical\u00a0Bug Fixes:</strong></li><li>Updated Unreal\u00a0Engine\u00a0pre-requisites to be included in the build</li><li>Fixed attachment issue (relative instead of world) that misaligned the rings when you get new rings if you had rotated the camera using the mouse wheel</li><li>Fixed text on card tooltip that wasn't displaying correctly due to font</li><li>Fixed Options menu in game, as was previously soft-locking the game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:43:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7c/e7c5397d6acbc994a47110a6caa0614f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brainoid", "HonestDan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
