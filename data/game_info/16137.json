On your search for food in the post-apocalyptic wastelands, you blatantly destroy everything in your way and finish off a dying society. Resources are scarce, so you turn to the next best thing: meat that is still running around; whether those are dangerous mutated animals, or humans trying to rebuild a broken world does not make much of a difference. On the bottomline, they are all very tasty.<br/><br/>You dish out damage using mostly your own body:<br/><ul><li><strong>pee</strong> on your enemies,<br/></li><li>use your radioactive <strong>poop</strong>,<br/></li><li><strong>vomit</strong> the hell out of the poor bastards that encounter you, and<br/></li><li><strong>slide</strong> and <strong>dash</strong> into everything.</li></ul><br/>If that's not enough, you can use <strong>weapons</strong> lying around in the wasteland, as well as <strong>corpses</strong> of slain enemies or anything that can be picked up. There are also a lot of <strong>deadly traps</strong>, but you may be able to use them to your advantage.<br/><br/>The gameplay is pretty straight-forward: kill enemies, eat their meat, find more enemies, repeat. Really, there is not more to it. Yes, the game is very violent, but it does not try to hide this behind euphemisms; it is very blunt about that, which makes this the kind of over-the-top ridiculous gem that we from Das Humankapital like to play.<br/><br/>Beat the single-player campaign in 13 levels stretched over 5 environments. Become the perfect weapon of mass digestion: the Homo Metabolicus. There are approximately <strong>7 hours of gameplay</strong> waiting for you. But beware, it's not made too easy!Features<ul><li>Classic platformer controls combined with 360\u00b0 aiming.<br/></li><li>Lots of secrets, easter eggs and hidden goodies!<br/></li><li>Reactive environments: Use fire, electricity, fluids, wind etc. to your advantage!<br/></li><li>Surreal post-apocalyptic stages, filled with absurd mutants and deadly traps!<br/></li><li>A story line about an epic battle for the future of this planet!
