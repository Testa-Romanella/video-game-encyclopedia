There may be some bugs.</p>\n\n<p>When you start:</p>\n<p>-- Press down arrow to pass text</p>\n<p>-- Press space to open pause menu</p>\n<p>-- Press Z once to switch to control tab.</p>\n<p>-- From there you can see/change controls</p>\n<p>Some of the controls listed need to be unlocked before you use them. If a control seems to not be working, you probably have not unlocked it yet</p>\n<p>You can change your controls to most lowercase characters, space, enter, and the arrow keys.</p>\n\n<p>Save Codes:</p>\n<p>The engine this game was made on does not have a way to save. for that reason, \"save codes\" were used. If it is your first time playing, just press enter with no save code, but if you have one, you can enter it to save your progress. Click the red stop-sign at the top of the project to stop the project and get a save code.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music for this project made by\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/users/squig3\u00a0Huge thanks to this dude! His soundtrack kinda carries this project.</p>\n<p>Sound effects borrowed from\u00a0https://scratch.mit.edu/users/theChAOTiC/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:23:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1a/c1ab7252f65dd4f99ed368191c4abe07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Peas_N_Carrots"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
