Farty is a roguelike prototype inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac.\r\n Farty is chemical cloud who wants to scape from the lab to finally be free. In this game you will help him, passing throw multiple rooms, fighting with other experimental enemies, evolving and fighting to achieve the exit.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\nSemi procedural room generator:\r\n  \r\n\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in the game was to make a semi procedural room generation. This game has multiple room designs with different enemies\u2019 locations. When you start a new room, the game distributes this rooms randomly, so each game you play will be different from the previous one.</p>\n\r\nSpecial rooms and evolving powers:\r\n  \r\n<p>Every run has one special room that give you the chance to evolve your character. Farty can absorb the power of the special room, evolving and changing his stats.\u00a0<br/>Every power up give you a different way to play: changing the aim, the projectile stats, movement\u2026 etc.\u00a0<br/>At the moment we only have a few power ups, but we are working on new evolutions that will give the game more variety.</p>\n<br/>\n\r\nDevelopment Team:\r\n  \r\n\n<p>This project was made by:<br/><strong>Albert Pitarque:</strong> As the main programmer.<br/><strong>Alba Silva:</strong> As the 2D and FX artist.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T17:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c8/7c8a67f2507617196e3c632084c1092b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Albert Pitarque"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
