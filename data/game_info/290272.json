{"id": 290272, "slug": "reaper-mtg", "name": "Reaper MTG", "name_original": "Reaper MTG", "description": "Your. Best. Search. Ever.<br/><br/>Reaper is the best-of-class reference tool for Magic: the Gathering.\u00ae It includes all the cards from the new Amonkhet\u00ae set, and is currently available entirely free of charge for a limited period!<br/><br/>(Please note that Reaper MTG is a product of Fud\u00f5shin Design, which is in no way affiliated with Wizards' of the Coast inc.)<br/><br/>Reaper slashes through card sets and out-gathers Gatherer\u00ae to find what you want faster than any other search tool on any platform anywhere for tournament Standard, including all the cards for Amonkhet, Kaladesh, Eldritch Moon, Shadows over Innistrad, Oath of the Gatewatch and Battle for Zendikar editions. (Aether Revolt cards will be added very shortly).<br/><br/>It also provides rapid access to card prices from our friends at Tokyo MTG <br/>(http://tokyomtg.com - the best place to buy, sell and play MTG in Japan!) You can view Tokyo MTG's card pricing and availability for any card by using a two-finger long press on that card in the main table view.<br/><br/>Reaper is designed to be used during matches in a competitive situation, and was built for speed from the ground up to take advantage of powerful Apple technologies that provide superlative responsiveness that make it realistic to use in a match situation.*<br/><br/>- How Reaper Works -<br/><br/>Firstly, the cards are shown sorted by their Converted Mana Cost in a stylish,  uncluttered and easy-to-read list. The app makes use of HD card images to help you spot the cards you want that much faster, and it looks fantastic!<br/><br/>Secondly, Reaper's unique search interface provides instant filtering by Mana Cost, Rarity, Edition and now provides text searching on card names too. When you make a filter selection the results are returned immediately, so unlike other apps, you do not have to switch to another screen to build a search query.<br/><br/>You also don't have to peck out Collector's or Multiverse\u00ae ID numbers because it's usually faster to start tapping mana colours for the casting cost of the card you want to find, and the datastore responds instantly in real time; there is no waiting for the search results to be returned. <br/><br/>You can then quickly mark cards for later reference (with a long press), or examine the card in its full High Definition beauty. The marked cards are all available to view in their own list.<br/><br/>* Reaper was originally written for the Chiba Grand Prix, Japan in 2015, where Judges allowed its use at the tournament and praised its utility and speed of searching.<br/><br/>It was likewise allowed for use this year at the Tokyo Grand Prix, Japan in 2016, and once again praised for its unique searching and card finding system by Judges, organisers and players alike.<br/><br/>However,  please remember that use of electronic devices is always at the discretion of Judges at Wizards' sanctioned events, and you should always ask permission to use this app from both Judges and your individual opponents; thank you.<br/><br/>- Disclaimer &amp; Legal Compliance - <br/><br/>Reaper MTG for iPhone makes use of Wizards of the Coast intellectual property for their collectible card game 'Magic: the Gathering' under their generous Fan Site Licence, with thanks.<br/><br/>This App, promotional copy and support documentation necessarily make use of Wizards' cards, their names, game terms and rules terminology and  includes their artwork and icons for the game and its card sets.<br/><br/>All such intellectual property, trademarks, and reserved names including Amonkhet\u00ae, Aether Revolt\u00ae, Kaladesh\u00ae, Eldritch Moon\u00ae, Shadows over Innistrad\u00ae, Oath of the Gatewatch\u00ae, and Battle for Zendikar\u00ae are hereby properly recognised as belonging to Wizards of the Coast Inc. without claim to ownership or challenge of any kind.<br/><br/>All software design, user interface design, database design, data modelling, and all other software engineering by Lachlan Scott, Legendary CodeMage, Fud\u00f5shin Design 2015-2017.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7ea31969d6fa1922ce684ec82e08e2.jpg", "website": "http://www.fudoshindesign.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Lachlan Scott"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Lachlan Scott"], "esrb_rating": null}
