As the team leader, you must forget everything you ever learned about obliterating aliens simply with a barrage of violent ammunition--this monster is difficult to see, hard to kill, and seemingly impossible to evade. In the midst of this lurking terror, you must convince your squad to cooperate and complete tasks essential to both the success of the mission and your own survival.</p>", "metacritic": 78, "released": "2002-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T20:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5b9/5b910de05c60070908d0f4ba7bc30155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.74, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 26, "owned": 35, "beaten": 36, "toplay": 25, "dropped": 37, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 57, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 57, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Computer Artworks"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Vivendi Universal Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
