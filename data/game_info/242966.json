But not just any guards, they're zombies and demons from another world. What to do? Well, I need to get out quickly, but don't want to return home empty-handed.</p>\n<p>Try to destroy the guards and score big in the pyramid. It's good that you had the foresight to bring a bunch of weapons. And some have come before you, fallen, and left weapons behind as well. Throughout the game you will face crowds of zombies, monsters, demons and a lot of blood.</p>\n<p>Control keys:\r\n0,1,2 etc. - Weapon change\r\nWASD - Character movement\r\nSPACEBAR - Jump\r\nSHIFT - Sprint\r\nEsc - Exit the menu\r\nLMB - Shoot\r\nRMB - Aim</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d5/6d59b87e218c2f232e3e6e15f48d7113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lingualeo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
