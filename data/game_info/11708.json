Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss.<br />\nSPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.<br />\nAll of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.I&#39;m good at bullet hell shooters, won&#39;t I just breeze though the game then?<br />\nThe game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.Is there a story?<br />\nIt is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers.
