Play as two hunters who band together in their quest to defeat the new evil first!  This is a cozy 90s JRPG style game where finding topics to banter about is a key to survival and trading stories of past battles gets you new and powerful skills.  <br/><br/>It's a lot of jokes, think a LucasArts Adventure teamed up with a Final Fantasy clone. Turn based combat, trading games, dungeon puzzles (e.g. box pushing) and lot of be people to talk to and banter topics to collect. <br/><br/>There are options in the game to make combat easy and to give hints for the puzzles. You can turn them on and off anytime.<br/><br/>This game was made in a few weeks for my DnD group and now it's out here for anyone who might enjoy it!<br/><br/>Soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/cgg-music/sets/vamps-ost<br/><br/>Resources:<br/><br/>RPGMaker MZ<br/>Base Sprites and tiles from https://finalbossblues.itch.io/ <br/>Additional sprites from @hazeldaydreamer  (Check out https://enbyshydog.itch.io/pottyquest)<br/>Plugins from http://www.yanfly.moe/wiki/Main_Page", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T05:18:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/577/577ef1acf8a7c786b23378b8b3405490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 16, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CGG"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["CGG"], "esrb_rating": null}
