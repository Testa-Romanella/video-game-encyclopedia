It is similar in concept to chess, in that it takes place on a board with squares, but, instead of fixed rules when landing on another player's piece, an arcade-style fight takes place to determine the victor. Also unlike chess, each side has different pieces with ranging abilities. These abilities are enhanced when landing on a square of one's own color.</p>\n<p>Archon was originally developed for Atari 8-bit family, then ported to the Apple II, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh, PC-88, and NES. It was designed by Paul Reiche III (who also created the graphics for the game) and Jon Freeman, and programmed by Anne Westfall.</p>\n<p>A sequel was released in 1984: Archon II: Adept.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-20T17:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f20aeed24870ac6eb2c42486400bf46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Atari XEGS", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Classic Macintosh", "NES", "Commodore / Amiga", "iOS"], "developers": ["Free Fall Associates"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Ariolasoft"], "esrb_rating": null}
