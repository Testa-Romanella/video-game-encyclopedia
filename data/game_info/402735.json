Outside of aesthetics, I think mechanically, there are two things that are different but I still enjoyed making this. I definitely did not have the time to be original but I'll admit I could have done a few things better but this game was already taking up too much of my time. My eyes hurt , I'm lacking hours of sleep\u00a0and I have forgotten how to engage in social interaction haha. I do wish I could fix some of the issues here but I decided to just accept it as a loss and move on for now, like this is literally the second game I have completed and I just have to deal with the fact that I'm still a novice at all this gamedev stuff. Just discovered I can't even get the fullscreen working in WebGl. :(</p>\n<p>This PacMan Clone was meant to test the idea for another PacMan Clone. I didn't really want to make this game but after finishing the basic PacMan stuff, I felt I could add\u00a0a tiny bit more and make a\u00a0small mini-game for the next 3 days and just share it . That was 3 weeks ago :|</p>\n<p>I feel slightly bad for spending a lot more time on this than needed but I also don't feel bad because I...actually can't feel anything right now haha. I suggest downloading the standalone version, it is better.\u00a0The Web version works fine but also...it doesn't.\u00a0Irregardless of errors and stuttering, I hope you enjoy the game or else I cry like baby. Also I made a youtube video, it's cool just like you compadre.</p>\n<p>Send Bugs or HighScores to my twitter or here if you can comment, don't know how itch works.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T02:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63f6c2f28761a77aa1c68d3fb8e269d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Rosziv"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
