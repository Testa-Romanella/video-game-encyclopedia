Its a dangerous world, but our little Cephalopod has a trick up one of his eight sleeves: <strong>he can change his electric charge at will</strong>. Zoom across electric fields, twist through magnets, and use conductors to bend the world to your will.<br/><br/><strong>Never has the Right Hand Rule involved so many tentacles!\u200b</strong><br/><br/>The game is based on the actual physics of Electromagnetism -- which means you'll be an expert in the topic by the end.  Or, well, you'll have beaten a game.  And isn't that enough?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This game has a Level Editor, and as the developer of the game, I see it as my duty to prove I can beat any level players throw my way.  So roughly each week, I load up a level and record myself trying to beat it.  You can watch my suffering (and joy) in the Feel Bad Friday video series!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <ul> <li>Accurate Physics from a pedant you can trust<br/> </li><li>Electric charges that attract and repel you<br/> </li><li>Magnetic fields that cause you to spin according to Lorentz Forces<br/> </li><li>Conductors that warp electric fields, calculated using the Relaxation Method<br/> </li><li>Electric currents that lead to magnetic fields, via the Biot-Savart Law<br/> </li><li>44 Levels of fun! Plus one level of pure torture.<br/> </li><li>A Level Editor so you can make all your own levels, or do your own physics experiments.<br/> </li><li>A whole bunch of spikes and missiles.<br/> </li><li>The game comes with a virtual Voltmeter and electric field meter.<br/> </li><li>One more opportunity not to learn the Right Hand Rule!</li></ul> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Made by TestTubeGames, or more specifically me, Andy Hall. I run an indie game studio that's devoted to making fun, interactive science experiences.  Special Relativity, Particle Physics,  Gravity, you name it, I'm interested!<br/>Music was created by Brian Allen Holmes, and SFX were made by Kevin Notar.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-03T13:44:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf9e02f736000dac4a8cf416086bf09.jpg", "website": "http://testtubegames.com/shocktopus.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["TestTubeGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Educational", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["TestTubeGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
