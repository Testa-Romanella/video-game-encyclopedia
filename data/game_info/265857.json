The world is engulfed by ocean. The creatures of the sea have gained enough sapience to leave their home planet in search of sandy beaches and rocky outcrops to call home.</p>\n<p>You are the last turtle. The spirit of the Elder Turtle stirs you to search for your brethren. You must rejoin your kind and become one with the Elder Turtle. You must search the ends of the galaxy to unite with your turtle kind.</p>\n<p>Then, and only then, can you become the Star Turtle.</p>\n<p>Download the soundtrack here:\u00a0https://caveware.bandcamp.com/album/star-turtle-64-ost<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5dff121b8283061a1fbf58cba7dd4a37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Caveware Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
