The improved graphics, new toys and decorations, and the fun engaging levels make this a must-have in my book.&amp;quot; : 148Apps : 80%<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Puppy Sanctuary is an excellent game, and one that keeps the quality standard of iOS apps from Clockwork Pixels. What stands out for me are the sheer quality of the mini games. The Puzzle Bobble style bubble shooter could easily be repacked as a standalone app!&amp;quot; : The Smartphone App Review : 90%<br/><br/>&amp;quot;With great music, fluid animations, and satisfying puzzle solving, the game\u2019s presentation is fantastic. The aesthetics are a cute and endearing treat to jump headfirst into, helping to create a lighthearted and fun world with a surprising amount of depth!&amp;quot; : Leviathyn Casual : 85%<br/><br/>&amp;quot;If you love the game as much as I do, you should just upgrade to the full version as soon as you download it. Puppy Sanctuary is like the Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup of the iOS game world.&amp;quot; : App Advice<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Puppy Sanctuary is a great game. One I really enjoyed is that the only in app purchase that you will have to make is to get the full game. If you are an animal lover, then you should should consider taking a look at this and Kitten Sanctuary!&amp;quot; : Gamer Chica : 80%<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Puppy Sanctuary is a lot of fun, which didn\u2019t surprise me. This is another great game from Clockwork Pixels, creators of Kitten Sanctuary and Darkside. Get the demo version for free and unlock the full version at any time via a single one-time in app purchase!&amp;quot; : Arcade Life<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>Customer Feedback:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Right away I jammed the button for the full version, and now I&amp;#39;m getting treats, food bowls, and other stuff. I haven&amp;#39;t even scratched the surface of this deep game yet!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Definitely, surprisingly, since I never played the kitty game, one of the best, most addictive games I&amp;#39;ve played in recent memory!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Just finished off what&amp;#39;s available for free, every second was thoroughly enjoyable, and well ... that silly Bernard, knew he&amp;#39;d like the bubbles!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;As with Kitten Sanctuary this was an instant purchase. Even though it&amp;#39;s too cute and fluffy for my taste, I still have to rescue all those kittens and puppies!&amp;quot;<br/><br/>&amp;quot;I downloaded the game last night and immediately bought the full game. This game has me hooked, lined and sinkered and all in a good way!&amp;quot;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/815/815d5b302bcecacf3c48cc75a3a802f1.jpeg", "website": "http://www.ClockworkPixels.com/PuppySanctuary.htm?iOS", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Clockwork Pixels"], "genres": ["Family", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Clockwork Pixels"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
