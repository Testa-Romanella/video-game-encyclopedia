{"id": 967277, "slug": "nuwa-2", "name": "Nuwa", "name_original": "Nuwa", "description": "Welcome aboard the outer space exploration spaceship, Nuwa.<br/>Nuwa is a sci-fi strategy game that focuses on the creation of creatures. You will pilot the spaceship Nuwa, to explore an unknown galaxy, witness the wonders of bizarre animals and the remains of civilizations, look for habitable planets for human immigration, and create creatures to help you transform the planet's environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our destination is an unknown galaxy, where there may be Earth-like planets like our home planet, or gaseous planets similar to Jupiter; or there may be bizarre animals you have never seen before, as well as those unknown alien civilizations. Anyway, you will take with you limited supplies and facilities and check it out. You are the warrior of mankind and the pioneer who carries all responsibilities, because it is a road of no return, but the situation of mankind is in emergency. With the expectations and anxieties of the people, set sail.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A biological laboratory was specifically designed in constructing the spaceship. On the spaceship, you can create and cultivate creatures that can transform the unknown environment through genetic technology to help us implement our immigration plan. But remember, no species can survive alone, which is an unchanging law. For this reason, you may also need to create a set of ecosystem and balance the population of the organisms. But human genetic technology has been stagnant for so long that you may need to get through it on your own. Perhaps taking the only remaining tiny creatures from your home planets and putting them into very different environments for cultivation could bring about some hope.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the time when the wormhole to the outer universe was detected, another set of strange photoelectric signals was also detected. The results of the analysis showed that these signals are likely to be sent by intelligent individuals. But we have not received any similar signals in the years since then. Perhaps you will make some unexpected discoveries when you arrive at your destination. If you want to investigate, whether it's an alien civilization or an indigenous creature, remember to take protective measures.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T02:41:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f6/5f66ceeb2ddaa9626d27e76e08fda101.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wild Kid Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BD Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
