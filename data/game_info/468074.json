However to get a hold of such a drone you had to loot it from the maintenance shop and a few dings never did anyone's eyes good. Watch as you use the drones bouncing lasers and your own maneuvering to compete with the out of control bullets and rockets. With no capacity to aim all you can do is pull the trigger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Entrant for the Game maker's Toolkit 2020 Game jam.
