In dark gloomy times, everyone needs a bit of color in their lives. Inspired by color theory and the interaction of simplistic geometric shapes, let\u2019s keep the prism spirit alive.<br/></p>\n<p>In Prism Flipper, you control a triangle. The goal is to move the triangle with the black border through the playing field, to get to the triangle with the cyan border. You can flip the triangle onto neighboring triangles, alongside its edges.</p>\n<p>Your current triangle\u2019s color will combine with the color of the triangle that you flip onto. If your triangle is a primary color (red, yellow or blue), and you flip onto another primary color, the colors will be combined to produce a secondary color triangle (green, purple, orange). For example, if you flip a yellow triangle onto a red triangle, it turns into an orange triangle.</p>\n<p>If your triangle is a secondary color (green, purple, orange) and you flip onto the primary color, the color will be subtracted. For example, if you flip an orange triangle onto a yellow triangle, it turns back\u00a0into a red triangle.</p>\n<p>There are some combinations in Prism Flipper that will cause you to lose the game. If you combine two different secondary colors together, such as purple and orange,\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0if\u00a0you combine a secondary color with an opposing primary color, such as red and green,\u00a0it turns into a dark triangle and the game will end.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:09:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffe/ffe91da21171526b76b8c69cb537952f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["o3a"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
