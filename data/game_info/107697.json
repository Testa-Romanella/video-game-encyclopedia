It isn't finished, but the basics of a game are still there.<br/></p>\n<p>There are three difficulty options, ranging from Easy (4 colors) to Hard (6 colors). It can get pretty challenging, but the interesting scoring system provides a lot of opportunities for big points.</p>\n<p>The game will absolutely not run in modern\u00a0L\u00d6VE versions, and the fact it ran at all in its targeted version is something of a minor miracle. I\u00a0do not know if I will ever update it -- probably not. Sorry.</p>\n<p>The source is available in the Columns Clone GitHub repository.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d049dfe3690efbf10ed5ccf0301ad8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Xkeeper"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
