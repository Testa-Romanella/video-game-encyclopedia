A game that overflows with gems inspired by the arcade 2D high-times - 1000s of sprites and interlocking effects cumulating into a sensory overload of 16bit hype - while keeping that absolute, direct and perfectly controllable arcade grip. It took 2 years to perfect this game as a solo-developer.<h3>WHY YOU SHOULD GET THE FULL VERSION OF MANIC ARCHERS NOW</h3>Manic Archers is the <strong>first topdown Zelda-type versus game ever</strong>!<br/><br/><ul><li> On-the-point gameplay and simple yet deep mechanics<br/></li><li> First rpg-style top-down versus fighting game with an arcade feel<br/></li><li> Lovely, hand-animated pixelart, inspired by the golden age of 2d arcade games<br/></li><li> Highly strategic matches vs. complete chaotic infernos<br/></li><li> Interactive levels <br/></li><li> Many common multiplayer modes<br/></li><li> AI support and coop-mode to practice without your friends<br/></li><li> Atmospheric music and hard hitting sound-effects<br/></li><li> Easy to play, hard to master<br/></li><li> Authentic classic RPG-scale sprites and environment expanded to HD resolution </li></ul><br/>Official release planned for Switch, Playstation and Xbox separately till mid 2023.<br/><br/><h3>GAMEPLAY FIRST</h3>MANIC ARCHERS is an atmospheric and extremely <strong>addictive local and online multiplayer arcade</strong> game in pixelart-style.<br/>It features simplistic and <strong>on-the-point gameplay</strong> with <strong>amazing game mechanics</strong> and lovely pixelart-details.<br/>It is playable with up to <strong>4 players simultaneously</strong> on one single screen in several well known multiplayer variants.<h3>THE MOST SIMPLE GAME OF ALL TIME</h3>One screen and <strong>3 buttons</strong> is all you need to know - <strong>jump, shoot and dash/block</strong>. The depth of good gameplay is found in <strong>simplicity accompanied by great mechanics</strong>.<br/><br/><h3>THINK ZELDA AND DEATHMATCH</h3>With the intention to make a multiplayer match top-down game, MANIC ARCHERS owes to and actually <strong>should remind of the heritage of all top-down games</strong>  like the Zelda and Final Fantasy series. Imagine the same love for details put into a competitive multiplayer arcade game for 4 players simultaneously.<h3>APPROVED MULTIPLAYER FUN</h3>In versus-mode players each control an archer, shooting the opposing archers until only one archer is left - besides Free-For-All versus, Manic Archers is featuring several other <strong>well known multiplayer modes</strong>.<br/>During the game a lot of combinable and <strong>game changing powerups</strong> and special arrows appear on the playing field, enabling players to <strong>turn the game around</strong> in an instant.<h3>AI TO KEEP YOU GAMING</h3>In case you need one more player to start a 2on2 teamplay match or if you are alone and want to train, <strong>Manic Archers got AI opponents to fill up the slots</strong>.<h3>RETRO CAUSE WE DO NOT NEED 3D FOR THAT</h3>The game takes place on a <strong>single screen with classic arcade wrap-around scrolling</strong>.
