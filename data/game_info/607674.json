{"id": 607674, "slug": "danger-very-close", "name": "Danger Very Close", "name_original": "Danger Very Close", "description": "<p>Danger Very Close (DVC) is a first-person shooter game about using precision airstrikes and skilled movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Although classic-style shooters made a resurgence in the middle of the 2010s, most have taken their design directly from their inspirations, with limited attempts to blend in different genres or more-modern influences. Among those that do, weapons where the projectile originates from a source other than the player are rare or nonexistent.\r\n</p>\n<p>DVC takes a different approach by combining skilled movement with indirect-fire weapons inspired by Earth Defense Force 5\u2019s Air Raider arsenal. The fact that most attacks originate from a platform separate from the player means that attacks can arrive or be sustained while the player would normally be unable to attack, enabling new strategies.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Developed by JMTMJ using Unreal Engine 4</p>\n<p>Team:\u00a0Joseph Pham,\u00a0Matthew Vu,\u00a0Tea Laurey,\u00a0Michael Zaragoza, Juan Pasillas</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T05:16:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e56f64296de70f7b72727273f6d060d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrypticBiLY"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
