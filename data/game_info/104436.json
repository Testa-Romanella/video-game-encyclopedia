Your cupcake house is looking a bit dull. Your love wants you to steal a glowing cherry and push it back to your house for a nice decoration.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for Jamingtons 2.0 game jam. The theme was \"Circle\", so I made a game about a doughnut, and other round pastries/desserts.</p>\n<p>I only had time to finish making two levels, so level 2 is a hasty maelstrom of challenges all mashed into one, made in the last hour of the jam. Pick up the chocolate coins to buy bridges so that you can push the cherry back to your house.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p><p><strong><em>Unplug any joystick/game controller - there seems to be a camera issue with it for some players.
