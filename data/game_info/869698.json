Switch between having the full overview of the entire battlefield, constructing buildings, controlling many units, or choose to be in the middle of it, become a rank-an-file unit or a hero with special abilities. You and your teammates must work together and find your way to defeat the enemy team, by capturing important strategic locations, build a great economy and finally, strike down your enemies.<br/>\r\nThe game also includes an inventory system, items, quests, stores, as well as standard chat functionality. We might include crafting in the future.<br/>\r\nWe would think a typical game, would include between 4-20 players and last for about an hour, but we don't see why it shouldn't be possible to be even 100 hundreds of players for grand games lasting many hours. The framework which the game is based on, is used for MMO games, so the foundation is certainly there.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T05:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7d/e7db3ee67449f36e93fc02a214bb4d40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flem100"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Midas DK"], "esrb_rating": null}
