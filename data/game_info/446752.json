With a sigh, they opened a new tab in their browser and began scrolling through videos - something they usually do when they can't make any progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While watching a video, they noticed a peculiar parkour video being recommended. Curious, they pulled up the video. It was someone running through a factory, jumping off walls and avoiding dangerous, forgotten machinery with jumps of precision and timing.\u00a0They were astounded by the prowess of the runner in the video.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Going down a rabbit hole of parkour videos, the developer could feel the creativity rushing in. Ideas of parkour filled their head and, like that, they got trapped in a state of daydreaming.</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Fixed window resolution\u00a0of 960x540 (upscaled from 320x180)</li><li>Controller support</li><li>10+ rooms to run and jump through</li><li>Nice 1-bit pixel art</li></ul>\r\nVersion:\r\n<ul><li>0.1 (game jam build)</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>Arrow Keys Left + Right / Left Stick\u00a0/ D-Pad Left + Right - Move</li><li>X / A (Xbox controller) / Cross (Dualshock) - Jump</li><li>Esc / Options or Start (Dualshock) / Settings or Start (Xbox controller) - Pause Game</li><li>Hold Arrow Key Down / Left Stick Down / D-Pad Down and Press\u00a0X / A (Xbox controller) / Cross (Dualshock)\u00a0- Drop Through One Way</li><li>Press Direction Opposite of Wall and Jump Swiftly for far wall jump</li></ul>\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<ul><li>Camera shake doesn't happen on every death</li><li>Camera has very slight weird movement on far edges of horizontal-scrolling rooms.\u00a0</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Art &amp; Programming,\u00a0Design, Sounds by Jay 'Ihzzay' Wilson (Moon Metro Digital)</li><li>Music is AI generated by\u00a0Ecrett Music</li></ul>\r\nSocial:\r\n<ul><li>Studio Twitter: @moonmetrodigi</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T07:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/5454edbcb56a0ace14021b401c9e0262.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moon Metro Digital"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
