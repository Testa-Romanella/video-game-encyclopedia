The stronger you get, the stronger\u2014and more numerous\u2014your enemies get.<br/><br/>AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS<br/>Start with a basic pistol and gain new weapons and exciting power-ups as you kill more foes. Hunt them down and blast them to hell with a high-powered shotgun, or blow them sky-high with exploding barrels. Set up traps and gauntlets to defend yourself and thin the herd, or vaporize them with a C4 explosive pack\u2014the newest weapon, available only for iPhone and iPod Touch. Its kill or be killed, so use the wide range of weapons and defenses to stay alive as long as possible.<br/><br/>NEW APOCALYPSE-GRADE ARTILLARY<br/>Deliver a rapid blast of bullets with the Uzi, or kill\u2019em in clusters with Grenades and Rockets. Call in the daisy-cutters and massacre the map with a fiery, violent Airstrike.<br/><br/>OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE TACTICS<br/>Hunt\u2018em, trap\u2019em or defend against\u2019em; how you play is up to you. Play it on the offensive and storm the field in a spray of bullets, blood and fire. Use your turrets and barricades to slow them down while you pick them off. Play it on the defensive and set up a maze of barrels, barricades and turrets. Stay at a safe vantage point while your gauntlet filters them out before making it to your stronghold.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>AS AUTHENTIC AS IT GETS<br/>Sean T.
