But you're confident you can fix it. Absolutely.<br/><br/>Ha! As if. Now you're trapped in the terminal with an unstable ghost.<br/><br/>Appease the ghost by finding the thing it's been looking for --- except it doesn't quite remember what.<br/><br/>The right thing will make it happy; the wrong thing will make it angry. Happy ghost will let you out but angry ghost will start destroying things.<br/><br/>Investigate the rooms as much as you like, but you can only carry three (3) things.
