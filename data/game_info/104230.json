You find yourself on a desolate island (the island is randomly generated). And you've got various skills at your disposal which you can use to survive. For starters, you want to grab a few rocks and carve a primitive axe and pickaxe out of it. Now you have the ability to chop wood, and mine stone. The (pick)axes can be used as a weapon as well, although you want to make better weapons (battleaxes, swords, warhammers, bows) as soon as possible.</p><p>Golden Harvest should be run in the L\u00f6ve framework found on love2d.org.</p><p>Features:<br/> - Crafting<br/> - Cooking<br/> - Smelting<br/> - Smithing<br/> - Beekeeping<br/> - Agriculture<br/> - Seasons<br/> - Climates<br/> - Battlesystem (close combat &amp; ranged)<br/> - Lighting engine<br/> - Field of view</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5da/5daa6ff99e1f12eedc5054a1662e6cfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["VividReality"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
