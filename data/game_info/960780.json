{"id": 960780, "slug": "high-and-dry-2", "name": "High and Dry", "name_original": "High and Dry", "description": "In High and Dry you are tasked with commanding a pirate ship, trying to ready yourself to take on a showdown with Davey Jones! You made an agreement with him long ago and soon he will come for his end of the deal, are you going to go down without putting up a fight? As the clock runs down you can get stronger and upgrade your ship and your crew, but you only have so much time. Where will you focus your resources, towards better firepower to blast your enemies down? Or perhaps a larger crew to man your sails and make repairs, or maybe even purchase some abilities like mortars to knock your enemies away and dashes that help you avoid attacks!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Randomized Ocean</strong><br/><br/>Each time you play aspects of the game will be randomly generated so that each play through is unique, however some things will remain the same which allows you to learn as you play to help you eventually beat the game.<br/><br/><strong>Make Difficult Choices</strong><br/><br/>Across the ocean many text based encounters await you, some leading to combat and others not so much. What choices will you make?<br/><br/><strong>Upgrade your Ship</strong><br/><br/>You will make to make difficult choices, you only have so much time before Davey comes for you soul and all, so you're going to have to choose. More crew means more people manning the cannons, or more working the sails which makes you ship move much faster and be much harder to hit. Having lots of resources is good but they will weigh you down and lower your speed and evade chance. Powerful weapon combos can take down enemy ships in a hurry, but if you can't take a volley of hits what good does it do you? <br/><br/><strong>Strategy Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>During combat you will have to make some decisions as well. Having someone on sails is important or your ship will move like a sloth and your percent chance to evade enemy shots will be much lower but of course you need sailors manning the cannons to attack your enemies. If your ship has some holes in it who do you send down to make the repairs? Or do you? Cannons can be destroyed and need repairs but sailors can take damage as well and sailors gain experience throughout a play through making some better at certain tasks than others. Do you want to play offensively or defensively?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-15T03:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/305/305d3cf90046a2beccdf8328355afd6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Stewart"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Goose Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
