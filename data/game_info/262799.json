You have to buy and swallow words to be able to pronounce them. And words are expensive, especially the really good ones.  So Paul collects words he finds on the street: \u201eCherry, Dust, Chair\u201c. He wants to give them to Marie, to show her how much he likes her.<br/>\u201eThe great word factory\u201c talks about the world of words and the power of language. And the fact that in concerns of the heart, it doesn\u2019t always matter what you say but rather how you say it. The two children, Paul and Marie, are the best example for that.<br/><br/><br/>Awards<br/> <br/>-      GIGA Maus 2014<br/>-      Leipziger Lesekompass 2014 of Leipzig Bookfair and Stiftung Lesen<br/>-      P\u00e4dagogischer Interaktiv-Preis 2014<br/>-      Children\u2019s media award \u201eDer wei\u00dfe Elefant\u201c 2014  <br/>-      Among the best children\u2019s book apps 2013 at BesteKinderApps.de<br/>-      Among the best book apps 2013 at Kirkus Reviews<br/><br/><br/>Press<br/> <br/>-      \u201eA sweeping declaration of love for the power of words, the world of reading and the value of language \u2013 a joy for the whole family to be looked at again and again.\u201c (RBB Kulturradio)<br/>-      \u201eThis picturebook app inspires a love for literature.\u201c (DIE ZEIT)<br/>-      \u201eVery poetic.\u201c (ZEIT Wissen)<br/>-      \u201eA playful and mindful approach to language is creatively put into pictures and interactions!
