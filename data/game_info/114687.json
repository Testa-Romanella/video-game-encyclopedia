They're a sweet person and great to work with, and I had tons of fun on this project &lt;3 so thanks for working with me bud! This week's theme was Voice, so we have a game that has voice input as its main component. To play, call out Marco to hear your quarry and escape the haunted pool! I made all the assets, and Delrell did all the code and unity stuff for this. Their links are down below! Please go follow because they're making some super interesting stuff!! :) Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/delrell</p>\n<p>itch.io:\u00a0https://delrel.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Background music:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/352542/</p>\n<p>Base for 'breathing'\u00a0sound effect (modified by Alex)\u00a0:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/ShaneF91/sounds/386573/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99e/99ee111a4301882e1ebebae27056bad9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Magic Magpie Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
