It was dealing specifically with a depressive crash I had at the time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I was deep in the darkness, and all my friends were in the other room, and I knew if I could just get myself to get up and go out there, that it would make me feel better.\u00a0I knew it, but the struggle was so, so hard. I wanted to capture that feeling in a small interaction.</p>\n<p>After getting on medication and therapy, my life has turned around by now, but I always want to remember what it was like, so I can try and support other people going through it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T08:22:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726612c30f38b655bbfe92bd4d2fa431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wertle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
