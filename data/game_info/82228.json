Experience the lights, sounds &amp; fun of the greatest arcade games on show and own them all! With players playing, buying &amp; repairing cabinets the action heats up fast! Look out for power cuts, free plays, breakdowns and remember to empty your cabinets of all those shiny coins!<br/><br/>Arcade-opoly is a 1 to 4 player game where players dash around a classic video game arcade.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to buy and setup arcade games and begin to earn quarters from them. Your opponents will have to insert coins to play your arcade games should they stop in front them. Popular games will earn you double but don\u2019t let your games break as \u201cOut Of Order\u201d games will earn you nothing.<br/><br/>Players move around the arcade clockwise by first throwing both a black and a white die. You may only move with either dice, choose wisely which of the dice to move with!<br/><br/>Gameplay cards collected by landing on the Gameplay spaces can help or hinder you. Some cards will offer free games or free plays. Other cards though will trigger power cuts, force you to play an opponents game, move with only with one die or even send you back to Level 1.<br/><br/>To win the game you must be the first to collect enough coins from your arcade games coin box and reach the target money amount of 70 quarters. Be careful not to play or buy too many games because other costs may arise such as repair bills, lose change, power cuts and game crashes. Should a player lose all their startup money of 30 quarters the game ends. All the remaining players can then total up any coins left in their games with the highest being declared the winner.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>1 to 4 players either human or cpu<br/>A disco lights tabletop plus 6 other coloured tables<br/>Auto rotate board option<br/>Pawn slide or quick jump option<br/>Real recorded sound effects from the real board game version<br/>3 great music tracks<br/><br/>Real board game version also available!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:08:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/230/230e85a3ddb942d7f0e973a3c76e96fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Park Productions"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Eric Park"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
