What do we do now?</p>\n<p>Oh noes! School is out, but your friend has a problem. He left all his FAST noteboos in school, but doesn't have time to go get them, because if he does he'll be late for FAST eating practice. To help him out, you have to go back to school and find all his FAST notebooks for him. It won't be SUPER easy though! Baldi loves challenging his students with fun trivia problems whenever he can! Each time you find a FAST notebook, you'll have to answer some questions.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T06:27:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/680/6807ff8192573313648e85313eda8d17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Yoitsyourboibaldifan"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
