{"id": 528985, "slug": "containment-breach-symbiotic-labs", "name": "Containment Breach (Symbiotic Labs)", "name_original": "Containment Breach (Symbiotic Labs)", "description": "<p>You've been kidnapped by strange, alien creatures and forced into a tank of cold fluid. You watch and learn as they pierce your shell with instruments and run experiments on your blood. But there is a flaw in their prison, one that you will exploit and use to finally escape.</p>\n<p><strong>Containment Breach</strong> is a top-down stealth-action puzzler where you play as the alien breaking out of a human laboratory on Mars. You're quick and have sharp claws, but your greatest strength is your intellect and your observation. The direct approach is often not the best; observe your captors and learn their patterns, then re-direct their own security measures against them.</p>\n<p>Playing <strong>Containment Breach</strong> requires the use of a mouse and keyboard. A touchpad may suffice but is not recommended. A full, first-time playthrough takes about 30-40 minutes.</p>\n<p><em>Author's Note: </em>This game is considered feature-complete and I do not expect to add additional levels or content. I may update the game with balance adjustments, quality-of-life improvements, or bug fixes.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T04:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96b/96b31e24b90bf77a1f427a6f7ab75b09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Symbiotic Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
