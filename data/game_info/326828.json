{"id": 326828, "slug": "nanoboy", "name": "NANOBOY", "name_original": "NANOBOY", "description": "NANOBOY\r\n<p>NANOBOY is a 2D top-down shooter with a fast-paced play style reminiscent of arcade shooters and bullet hells. In the three standard levels you are given a color-coded RNA sequence, and you must hunt down and defeat enemy viruses in that order to unlock your nanobot's super weapon. <br/>All of that changes in the bonus Survival Mode, where you are frozen in place and may only rely on your reaction time to stop the hordes of pathogens from overrunning your position.<br/></p>\n<p>Created in just under 3 weeks, NANOBOY was the Fall 2018 final project of Florida Poly Game Design students Jesse Colkmire, Libby Harris and Haily Reinhardt. NANOBOY won the honor of first prize in the Florida Polytechnic University Fall 2018 Game Expo.<br/></p>\n\r\nTHE CONTROLS\r\n<p><strong>W,\u00a0S</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0strafe\u00a0forward and\u00a0backward</p>\n<p><strong>A, D</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0strafe left and right</p>\n<p><strong>MOUSE POSITION</strong> rotates the nanobot.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SHIFT</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 hold to increase movement speed</p>\n<p><strong>LMB</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 fire a bullet, or hold to shoot continuously</p>\n<p><strong>RMB</strong> \u00a0 \u00a0 when the RNA sequence is complete, fire your super bullet<br/></p>\n\r\nTHE ENEMY\r\n<p><strong>VIRUSES</strong> are the key to progression in every level. Red, blue, green and yellow Viruses leave behind colored RNA when killed. Collect this RNA in the order of the sequence presented, and you'll unlock a powerful super bullet. Be careful--Viruses shoot back.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PRIONS</strong> are enormous pathogens, boss enemies which wander each level waiting to be challenged--you can't move on to the next level without killing the current level's Prion... and they shoot back, too. You're going to need a bigger bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>WHITE BLOOD CELLS</strong> and <strong>ANTIBODIES</strong> can't do much else than swarm you, but don't underestimate them. Beware the \"hug of death\", and keep an eye out for the Health Blocks that the Blood Cells sometimes leave behind when killed--they might just save your life. <br/></p>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<ul><li>The sequence progress bar is misaligned with the RNA sequence display while the level's sequence is incomplete.</li><li>Smaller enemies tend to get stuck on bubbles. Moving into their threat range will cause them to dislodge themselves.</li></ul>\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n<p>Cover artwork by Meaghan Crowe.</p>\n<p>Music by artists on https://www.hooksounds.com\u00a0used\u00a0under\u00a0non-commercial mandatory attribution license.</p>\n\n<p>Artist: Nazar Rybak<br/>Title: Active Sport<br/></p>\n<p>Artist: Nazar Rybak<br/>Title: Tech Background</p>\n<p>Artist: HookSounds<br/>Title: Selcouth</p>\n<p>Artist: HookSounds<br/>Title: Emerging</p>\n<p>Artist: MusicPro<br/>Title: Under The Sun</p>\n<p>Artist: AudioPanda<br/>Title: Startup Innovation</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-10T04:45:48", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scr1ptkitty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
