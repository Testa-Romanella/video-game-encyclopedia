You can push your ball\u00a0\u00a0against the edge of the screen\u00a0to charge its bounce and bounce even higher. You're probably going to need to do this since our good friend friction will be slowing your ball down at all times.\u00a0Press Z to restart.<br/></p><p>I made this in a single evening because my friend said that she wanted to play that one game where you have to keep a ball from touching the ground, but she had no one to play it with.\u00a0So I made my own digital interpretation of it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Just to be clear, this is not a good game! There are so many tiny bugs. I did the programming\u00a0by salvaging bits and pieces from other games I'd made and combining them together in the ugliest way possible. It's mildly enjoyable to play though.\u00a0Maybe someday I'll sit down and make a version of this that I don't have to be embarrassed by.\u00a0That day will probably have to wait for a couple of years!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efa/efa25689e769f319d3105b3e93c93cbd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saddleblasters"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
