The unit focussed on HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), UI design and UX (User Experience). The game serves as a practical application of the concepts learned throughout the unit. The standout elements of the unit for me were the psychological aspects and concerns that need to be taken into account when designing games. Keeping the player in the forefront of game design is a must and this unit helped me to understand how and why that is the case.</p>\n\n<p>In Banana Hunt you play as the Monkey King, a mythical creature of the jungle who occasionally walks among the mortal monkeys in search of gold. The aim of the game is to collect as much gold as possible before you run out of the bananas that give you your corporeal form. Other monkeys can be found within the game and either saved or consumed. Mechanically this works as a trade off between a score multiplier per monkey (dark option) or a larger multiplier for the successful saving of all the monkeys (altruistic option). There are also magical hourglasses which stop the passage of time for all except the Monkey King.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T12:20:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84eb56cb9216aa6f3512e06b169b79d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 239, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RonaaFunkyGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
