You have snuck into the holy food temple, the home of delicious and fattening foods, however some may describe this place as a zone of danger. Beware your step as your own puffy weight can bring the whole level down! However, remember that since you're a rather large fellow, you have a large and demanding appetite and ninja is hungry work! So with all this food around, it should be obvious what you should do!</p><p>We highly recommend a gamepad for this game, however if you're adamant to use the keyboard, we suggest tapping buttons instead of holding them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/053/0531d23ec26f0f3ee444e4ca36027b7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sindraws"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
