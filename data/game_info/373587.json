Sometimes he just wants to play cards!</strong><h3>HEAD TO HEAD WITH DEATH HIMSELF</h3>Death likes nothing more than having a quick game of 21. Its his favourite hobby (apart from knitting!). However, he hates losing!<h3>FAST PACED 21</h3>Simply try and make 21 in any one of the four lanes available. Make 21 and Death gets annoyed! Get combinations of 21 in a row and max out the multiplier to extend your timer (life). Keep playing through the rounds and you'll be rewarded with special cards that may help or hinder your progress.<h3>ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE!</h3>Theres lots to aim for in the game along with all the achievements you'll want to unlock. Can you make a \"5 card trick\"? Will you quit on Death (do you dare?) or will you find out what Ghost Bustin' is?<h3>SPECIAL CARDS</h3>It would be a boring game of 21 if there weren't any Special Cards to play with and Death has supplied us with some of his best - \"The Blind Mans Curse\", \"Heart Stopper\" &amp; \"Lane Bomber\" to name just a few. Some will help and some will hinder your progress. Death enjoys it when you receive a nasty card.<h3>Dead Simple 21 is simple to learn and easy to play. Its suitable for everyone and also has 3 different game modes to try your hand at.</h3>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-18T11:05:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3dba8a5a1b26641adb0b1a75ff4c2aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["mgeorg1", "Addictive 247 Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Addictive 247 Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
