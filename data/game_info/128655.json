Play as a very chaotic yet equally good dog who follows its own rules and get what it wants no matter the cost in this short yet challenging fast paced runner-style 3D platformer.</p>\n<p>Featuring:</p>\n<ul><li>Five Challenging Levels!</li><li>Cute Cartoon Graphics!</li><li>Dog-Based EDM Soundtrack!</li><li>A Certified Good Gog!</li></ul>\n<p>Music by Malin Pappas of Ziggurat!
