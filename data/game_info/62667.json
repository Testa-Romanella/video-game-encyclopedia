Build challenging courses. Create amazing landscapes. Manage the support staff. Attract golfers from around the globe. Host and play golf tournaments. Take the decisions necessary to bring your golf resort to the top, and attract the very coveted VIP golfers!<br/><br/>The gameplay in Boss Golf is based in three distinct but connected pillars: Build, Manage, and Play<br/><br/><br/><strong>Boss Golf</strong> features several types of terrain, decoration types, paths, buildings. You can use the tools at your disposal to completely customize the look and feel of your golf course, as well as the amenities available for the golfers who are visiting. From swimming pools to tennis courts; from rolling fairways to waste bunkers; from seaside cliffs to green hills. There's very little limitation in how you can build up your course. Just hope the golfers enjoy what you are building!<br/><br/><br/><strong>Boss Golf</strong> features several types of employees that you can hire for working on your golf course: <strong>Marshalls </strong>to speed up play; <strong>Landscapers </strong>for turning your plans into reality; <strong>Builders </strong>for erecting course infrastructure; <strong>Janitors </strong>for making sure the environment is clean, and many more! You'll need to carefully balance the sheets to make your resort turn a profit, or face the wrath of the board of directors!<br/><br/><br/>Boss Golf also features a more relaxing form of golf gameplay. Any course you build, you'll be able to go ahead and play it with your character. Golf gameplay works in a more indirect system: that is, you are effectively acting as a caddy to your golfer, telling him where you think he should hit. The golfer will then take try to take the shot you suggests, with the end results taking his attributes into account! Keep an eye on his confidence too!An AI PlaygroundThe main objective in Boss Golf is to create a successful golf resort, while fulfilling varied scenario win conditions. But what does it mean to have a successful golf resort? In Boss Golf, this means creating a resort that the AI golfers will enjoy visiting and playing, a place where they can go and meet their golf peers, relax from a day of hard work, and compete for trophies. As such, Boss Golf also features a system for better understanding the AI's opinions of a golf hole, of the environment, of the clientele, all things that you should take into account when building your resort.Create Your ScenariosTo extend replayability, Boss Golf will also ship with an extensive Scenario Editor, giving you full freedom in creating custom missions and scenarios that you will then be able to share with other players.
