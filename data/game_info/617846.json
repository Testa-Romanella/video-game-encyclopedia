This game is a game about joining and unjoining? disjoining? Er...Eitherways you have to keep connecting and disconnecting with your agent to rescue the hostages(hostages sold separately)  and connecting and disconnecting with your Traffic Disruptors to keep the dirty cops away(some assembly may be required).</p>\n<p>This game was created for the 5th Annual GMTK Game Jam.(And it is my 4th entry in 5 years... I had a Did Not Finish last-to-last year :( ). The theme of this year is Joined Together. In my game I was trying to convey the importance of not just a Super Agent but also the person at a screen assisting them remotely. That is, they must Join Together to be successful.</p>\n<p>Anyyhoooo I hope you enjoy and please do rate the submission :D. Even if it is janky and horrible do let me know :)</p>\n\n<p>Apologies for no audio</p>\n<p>Also: Map colours inspired by GTA Vice City's map colours. <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pathfinding achieved with the help of an awesome Unity asset:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A* Pathfinding Project by Aron Granberg.
