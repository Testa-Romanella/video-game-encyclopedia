I started it in early 2003 as the game that I used to teach myself Flash, and periodically revisited it over the next 7 years, between other projects, until I'd finally reached my goal of 31 rooms (chosen because\u00a0<em>Dragon's Lair</em>\u00a0has 30 rooms) in 2010.<br/><br/>I realized that I'd totally missed\u00a0the 10th anniversary of its release during Coronageddon last year, and Flash has been officially deprecated (RIP Flash), so I thought it would be cool to make executables of the game and put them up here.<br/><br/>The game's original webpage -- with a timeline of its development -- can be found here:<br/>http://studiohunty.com/dungeon/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-18T02:57:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a65/a65ebdf8a97c6c4b93b5fd38d6bfae91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["luvcraft"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
