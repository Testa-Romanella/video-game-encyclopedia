The balloon is so powerful Peter the Pigeon is always floating upward, so he\u00a0never needs to flap, only dip down into a dive.</p>\n<p>All Art, Music, Sounds, and Code we're created by Tate.

But I am pleased to have taken part in The GMTK Game Jam 2021. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>- Apologies it is only available for download for Mac. I had issues installing Unity support for Web GL and Standalone PC Build Settings. Give it a quick watch the Gameplay on Youtube if you cannot play it yourself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cd6c503f109ecd8d4f5fab48a50a103.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Prawn Star Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
