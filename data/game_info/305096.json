{"id": 305096, "slug": "windwalker-itch", "name": "Windwalker (itch)", "name_original": "Windwalker (itch)", "description": "<p>In Windwalker, two players take on the role of a father and daughter who were on a camping trip in a remote region of Alaska. They return to their campsite to discover it destroyed, and realize that they have a limited amount of time to make it to shelter before the storm gets worse.\u00a0 The Father is controlled using a controller, and they will be navigating through the forest. They will also be using headphones to listen for audio cues about their environment.\u00a0A second player playing the daughter will use their phone to access a web page and help the father navigate with a crudely drawn \"campground map\" and gps, as well as using the light from their phone. The two eventually realize that they're not alone in the forest, and the race to get to the park rangers cabin becomes more and more desperate. Work together to survive the night in the forest and escape the Windwalker.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/198/198c3bd0eb787decfbf37bbfa9ad881c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rzekii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
