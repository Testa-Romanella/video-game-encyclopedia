While our goal is to introduce increasingly sophisticated 3D modeling tools, Immerse Creator is initially releasing with a very simple and easy to learn 3D sketching system.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe will soon be launching mulit-player mode, which will open the door to a whole new world of collaborative creativity.  Subscribers to multi-player will be given a private passcode to their scene, similar to a conference call dial-in, which they can share with others they wish to join them.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA non-VR 'viewer' mode will also be distributed for free, which will enable those without a VR headset to explore Immerse scenes.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/932/9329da0c8cd701a7910e1d3c32a8e519.jpg", "website": "http://www.immerseinteractive.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JonBrouchoud"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Arch Virtual"], "esrb_rating": null}
