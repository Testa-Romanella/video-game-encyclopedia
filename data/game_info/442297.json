It is heavily commented so you can pull apart how this is being achieved.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Sprites that you want to be blocking tiles (meaning the player can't walk through them), should have the first sprite flag turned on.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that when the player tries to move, we store the coordinates of where they are <em>trying</em> to go. Then we check those new coordinates to see if the map tile in that spot has a sprite flag of 1 or not. If it does, we just ignore the player's attempt at moving. But if it doesn't, we change the player's location to the new coordinates and play a footstep sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a224e4e39f2bde284d51104644ab4817.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MBoffin"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
