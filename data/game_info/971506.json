You hear the rumble of three hundred enemy tanks advancing against your position in the North African desert. Deploy your tanks, artillery, air cover and ground troops in this historically accurate simulation. Victory or defeat. It is in your hands. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDecision in the Desert is a classic real-time simulation game from the 80s designed by Sid Meier and Ed Bever.
