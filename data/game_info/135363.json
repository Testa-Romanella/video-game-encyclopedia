Humanity did not stand for this, and so seven powerful magicians set up a trap. With magical treasure, the monsters of the realm were lured into a castle atop a high mountain. They were then locked inside with a magical barrier seal, never to emerge to wreak havoc again.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOver the years, a town formed at the base of the mountain. Eventually, they established a law: those found guilty for heinous crimes would be taken to the castle and thrown inside. If they were to escape from the nest of vicious monsters alive, they would be fully pardoned of their crimes and released. To date, however, none have emerged once entered.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLiving in the town was a thief named Conner. He was quite an accomplished thief, with a criminal record as long as his arm, if you wrote really small. However, he was not invincibile, and one day, he was eventually cornered and captured. For his aforementioned record, he was sentenced to imprisonment in the castle of curses...\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 1.0.0.1</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Added gamepad functionality.
