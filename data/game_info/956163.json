{"id": 956163, "slug": "shogi-proverbs", "name": "Shogi Proverbs", "name_original": "Shogi Proverbs", "description": "<p>Interactive explorer for Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny Dictionary of Shogi Proverbs).</p>\n\n<p>Shogi Proverbs</p>\n<p>This project was inspired by James Leahy's similar \"Shogi Proverbs\" app[1].</p>\n<p>Both of these projects were inspired by \"Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny Dictionary of Shogi proverbs)\"[2].</p>\n<p>But the approaches are different. Leahy's app converted the source text into code,</p>\n<p>and focused on creating an elegant book-like reading experience; it's well done</p>\n<p>and much appreciated! On the other hand, this interactive reader takes a</p>\n<p>different approach, aiming to...</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Use the original text with minimal editing</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Help find and fix any errors in the original diagrams &amp; notation</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Improve understanding by visualizing diagrams with moves applied</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Provide kanji font options for clear and aesthetically pleasing game views</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Support numeric rank coordinates (\"5c\" == \"53\")</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Extract any position as standard SFEN for further analysis</p>\n<p>It was an experiment and I'm happy with the results! By parsing the original</p>\n<p>source text, I found and fixed several errors in notation and had fun exploring the</p>\n<p>diagrams and move sequences. Instead of scrolling to see diagrams and imagining</p>\n<p>how move sequences change the position, I can see the dedicated board and follow</p>\n<p>the moves provided by the text. When I want to go deeper, I can copy SFEN to</p>\n<p>the clipboard and fire up lishogi.org[3] or any shogi tool that can import SFEN.</p>\n<p>There are some limitations inherent in this reader's approach, though. In particular,</p>\n<p>there's no deep understanding of the flow of moves &amp; text. The author jumps around,</p>\n<p>sometimes describing hypothetical alternative moves or listing moves as</p>\n<p>if a single player could move repeatedly. No attempt is made to interpret</p>\n<p>context from sentences; instead, it's up to the reader to start from a</p>\n<p>diagram link and then apply each move by touching the notation. Colors provide</p>\n<p>hints about which moves can be applied from the current position and whether</p>\n<p>making such a move will be in sync with the player on turn, but it's perfectly</p>\n<p>possible to apply moves out of order or get lost. So track carefully and,</p>\n<p>when in doubt, just start from a diagram and remember the SFEN is there if you need it.</p>\n<p>A note about notation: it's all text using Japanese fonts that include the necessary</p>\n<p>kanji piece characters. The source fonts can be found by name on Google Fonts[4].</p>\n<p>For visual simplicity and consistency, promoted pieces without dedicated single</p>\n<p>kanji characters use an apostrophe to indicate that they're promoted. This is</p>\n<p>sometimes read in math notation as \"prime\", so '\u9280 is \"prime silver\"</p>\n<p>or \"promoted silver\"; likewise '\u6842 is the promoted knight and '\u9999 is the promoted lance.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - The board can be resized by dragging the splitter bar between the text and board view.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - On touch devices, some precision may be needed to operate the UI. It's a bit quirky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - This app uses zero persistent state (doesn't save any settings to nonvolatile storage)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so hopefully it's easy &amp; quick enough to configure once per run!</p>\n<p>This was a for-fun weekend hacking project, offered freely for the love and promotion</p>\n<p>of the great game of Shogi. I hope you enjoy it!
