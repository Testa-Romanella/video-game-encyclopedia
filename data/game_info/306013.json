It&#39;s the Chogue that refreshes!</p>\n<p>Chogue is a hybrid game created out of two masterpieces, chess and Rogue, by Jonathan Lessard and Pippin Barr. Throughout its design and development we followed the (fairly) strict rule of making decisions that meant Chogue corresponded either to chess or to Rogue in each of its elements, from its spatial layout (Rogue) to its movement style (chess) to its combat system (chess) to its overall gameplay structure (Rogue). The result is a game that is as least as good as Rogue and chess put together. If not better than that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-03T00:06:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/774/77407790bb3b5cae39c9618a58db7a49.jpg", "website": "https://jonathanlessard.net/chogue/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["pippinbarr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
