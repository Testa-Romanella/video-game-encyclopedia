In it you could press the keys \"A\" \"S\" or \"D\" in a specific combo in order to produce a small red cube. You (Or another person) could also hold \"J\" \"K\" \"L\" to do the opponents combo if you download the windows version 2 update. Holding the keys down spawns out a stream of them.</p>\n\n<p>--Included in the download files of Version 1 MAC/WIN are some wallpapers from the logos of The Knock-Out Punch and the motion test of one of the characters, Polaroid.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c13dc979b39fb052f24084e243a26af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JW.Berry"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
