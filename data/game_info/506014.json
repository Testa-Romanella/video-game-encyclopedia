Luckily, Jones also wants Smith to die and might kill Smith without you lifting a finger.</p>\n<p>Luckily you have a button that interacts with a microchip in Jones' brain. When you press the button, Jones will proceed to push Smith off the cliff. However, you don't want to push this button unless you think Jones won't commit the murder of his own volition.</p>\n<p>Watch Jones' heartrate and movements and decide what he is going to do. Click to push the button and Jones will do the dirty deed for you.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Just click to make the character push the button and force Jones to kill Smith.</p>\r\nPhilosophy\r\n<p>This \"game\" is an interactive example of a Frankfurt case. The central question is whether or not Jones is morally responsible for Smith's death since he couldn't have done otherwise. Even if he chose to kill Smith, had he chosen not to commit the murder he would have still killed Smith since you would have pushed the button.</p>\n<p>Here's the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy entry:\u00a0https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alternative-possibilities/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T04:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4bd8f2ea14b95369f37429316b730a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tallshrimp"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
