{"id": 718737, "slug": "bat-crawler", "name": "Bat Crawler", "name_original": "Bat Crawler", "description": "<p>One of my first original games developed in the Godot game engine. The idea of the game is that you play as a character bat, and you navigate a dungeon to collect all coins to proceed to the next level while avoiding obstacles that can potentially kill you. If this gets enough positive feedback, I will be updating this game to be played on a mobile (Android/IOS) while adding more levels, and modifying the game slightly based on suggestions. I'm also hoping that this game gets speedrun because that would be really entertaining. Also be prepared to button smash your space bar key lol.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T06:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90518215bc343f66754f45ac2d42215.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bropharah"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
