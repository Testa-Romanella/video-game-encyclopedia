{"id": 927274, "slug": "fragile-masculinity", "name": "Fragile Masculinity", "name_original": "Fragile Masculinity", "description": "<p>Get ready to face off against the three biggest  \"alpha males\" in town in this bullet hell game about fragile  masculinity! First up is \"Bricked-up Bob\", the brick-layer with biceps  the size of bowling balls and an ego to match. He's built like a tank  and just as tough to take down. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Next is \"Fratbro Fred\", the stereotypical frat  boy who's never heard the word \"no\" and thinks consent is something you  get from a lawyer. He's got a trust fund, a keg of beer, and an endless  supply of slurs to hurl your way. <br/></p>\n\n<p>And finally, there's \"Emotionally Unavailable  Dad\", the guy who thinks vulnerability is a weakness and showing  emotions is for wimps. He's as cold as a frozen burrito and about as  affectionate as a cactus. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Each boss fight is a chaotic, bullet-filled  frenzy as you dodge, weave, and shoot your way through their attacks.  But don't worry, you're not unarmed \u2013 you've got an arsenal of slurs at  your disposal, from \"Get a life!\" to \"Call mom already!\". <br/></p>\n\n<p>So get ready to take on these three caricatures  of toxic masculinity, and maybe learn a thing or two about what not to  do in the process. Because if there's one thing tougher than taking down  these bosses, it's confronting your own issues and working to be a  better person. Or you could just keep shooting at them. Your call. \r\n</p>\r\nDiscord\r\n<p> If you want to talk about the game or just want to follow us as developers, feel free to join our discord.
