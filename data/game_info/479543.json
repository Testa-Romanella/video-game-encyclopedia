I took the theme of Rewind and went with the concept of undoing damage, with buildings being rebuild, people being brought back to life and trees regrowing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I ran out of time and submitted what I had so far.<br/>You can regrow trees with the water spell, ressurect people and rebuild the wizard tower.<br/><br/>I will finish the rest of the development soon.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and thanks to Never Rest Studio for the music.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T11:11:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a1aeea0765ba7af7f0fca53675ae630.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bobby"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
