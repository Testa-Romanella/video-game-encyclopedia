Inspired by the likes of Caves of Qud, Ancient Domains of Mystery, and IVAN.</p>\n<p>Explore the procedurally-generated world, mutate your body into grotesque forms, explore the depths and surface of the planet, find your way home, or embrace your exile. Each time you create a new game, the world will be created anew. Every playthrough will be different and challenging. Axu is in very early development, and is growing every day.
