My inspiration for this game came from the Pixar movie The Incredibles. Hints the Incredibles picture in the beginning.\u00a0 What sparked my idea for this story line was the character Jack-Jack. He is a baby and the youngest child of the Incredibles family. For the first year of his life, Jack-Jack didn't seem to exhibit any signs of powers, presumably being too immature for superpowers to come about. However, later on in the movie Jack-Jack begins showing signs of his powers and has trouble controlling them. This is where my idea came about, to create a story where there is a young boy who grew up in a superhero family and when he reaches the age of 13 he is finally developed enough to pick out a power that he will have for the rest of his life.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The story begins the day before Tom\u2019s 13 birthday. The player learns about Tom\u2019s family and his wants/needs. While Tom\u2019s need might not be clear right off the bat, the player quickly learns that Tom isn\u2019t a fan of becoming a superhero because he believes that\u00a0 he will lose his \u201cnormal\u201d life.\u00a0 Later on in the game the player is left which the choice to have Tom follow is want or his need. His need being, accepting that he will become a superhero and fight with his family.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I tried to keep the story interesting by allowing the player to chose what path they want Tom to go down. The player is present twice with the choice of whether or not Tom should go with his want or his need. The first choice is early in the beginning. The player gets an idea of how Tom feels about turning 13 get getting his powers.\u00a0After conducting some research\u00a0about certain powers the player can chose if Tom starts to have a change of heart or if they want Tom to stick with his want. The story then differs slightly after the player makes this decision. As each branch of the story unfolds, the player can make one final decision near the end on whether or not Tom changes his mind or stick with his original plan that the player made earlier.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>I tried my best to make this story interactive as possible following the story line I created. Not only can the player make the choice between Tom\u2019s want or need, but they can make choices of what Tom eats for breakfast, what power Tom gets and what type of suit he wears.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy!\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T07:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce06405612abb64239194c8ccf026596.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shoeflyer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
