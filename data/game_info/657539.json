You play as <strong>Mac</strong>, a new student embarking on their scholarly journey. As you progress through your first day of classes, <strong>your environment changes in response to your actions</strong>. By re-playing Mac\u2019s first day, you learn about the <strong>consequences and weight of your words</strong> - and that every conversation is an opportunity to create safe spaces through how we treat others.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rob / P1XL | Coding<br/>\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0mari / catamariii | 2D Art<br/>\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Marina | Music &amp; SFX<br/>\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tamarah Reynolds | Writing<br/>\u2666\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0wavy | Level Design &amp; 3D Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:57:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bbdd0f0096f20905f65f7b0dbcb5fe6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mari", "SunnyWunny"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
