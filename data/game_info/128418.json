{"id": 128418, "slug": "twowt", "name": "Twowt", "name_original": "Twowt", "description": "<p>My entry for GMC Jam #5, a 72-hour jam with the theme TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. In Twowt, you navigate a maze on a coin. Stuck somewhere? Just flip the coin around and try the other side. Your lateral thinking will be challenged as you try to piece together how to get to the goal. Or maybe you'll just use trial and error, I won't judge.</p>\n<p>The game was made in less than 24 hours, so it's very short and disappointing and more of a prototype than a finished product. With that in mind, hopefully you'll get a nice puzzling distraction for around 15 minutes playing it!<br/></p>\n<p>The rest of the Jam entries and more info can be found on the GMC: https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?forums/gmc-jam.9/<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Also, this game supposedly was the first submitted game to the jam! Not that submitting your entry early makes it better or anything, I just feel like bragging a bit about it :P</p>\n<p>...and guess what's even better? It won Best Use Of Theme and ranked 12th overall! Woo! :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d629403509b07b3afc2036c6c56d8bf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
