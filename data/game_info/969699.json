A calm place in the open. A bathroom. Or maybe... your personal computer?<br/>To help Liza on her quarantine time, Zanardi developed an interactive experience on a cozy cabin, to relax and put herself into another-dimension-for-the-mind.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this application contains a very particular bug, where she may travel to Zanardi's computer. And... while on it, she may find files and things that where hidden... for a good reason.<br/><br/>Incarnate as Liza discovering odd secrets, fighting bunny-suit troops, deceased computer garbage, among other deep digital-creatures from the computer insides.<br/><br/>The gameplay for Fi da Puti Samurai is quite simple.<br/>This is not a cumbersome rpg game, bug an action-oriented roguelite. You don't need super-human reflexes to win, neither need to read lore if you dont want to. Just kick in, blast, get blasted, and have some fun!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T16:16:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/027/02729b0bb8aa7914cd5a57742cd6932a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zanardi and Liza"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Zanardi and Liza"], "esrb_rating": null}
