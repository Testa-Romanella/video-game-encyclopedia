You said something VERY offensive and now everyone wants to harvest your organs! Well, it's not all over yet! These people? They are soft! Collect the 7 Chaos emeralds within 7 days and you might have a chance to live! <br/> </p>\n<p>Five Nights at Pantbear; This game was originally a joke I (Alex) made within a single day cause our friend Jess had a huge FNAF phase and Katie generally finds things like these funny. But then we (Katie and Alex) went on a brain blast rampage and started having so many silly ideas on what we could include in this funny game that has us and our friends in it that it actually ended up turning into like an actual FNAF fangame? Since we never expected it to get this big some things were initially rushed and then they were a pain to expand on</p>\n<p>This game has the capacity to startle you with jumpscares but it's not really supposed to be scary I'd say. It does have some creepy things in it but it's more funny and weird than it is scary. <strong>DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF EPILEPSY</strong> because there ARE flashing lights and things like that. </p>\n<p>The Story: You'll be taking the role of Geana, our silly little gnome friend she's so silly but she does bite sometimes, and in this game she did, she said something she shouldn't have and now she's in big trouble. Help her not get evicted and maybe she'll learn something from this experience and grow as a person. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T14:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8def32a5a2156c46a7ea7141ca555648.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["K-Lah Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
