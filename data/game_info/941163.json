Grand Prix mode lets you take on each track in order, getting 60 points by the end will crown you champion!</p>\n<p>Points are awarded 10 for first place and 1 less for each other place, example 2nd place gets 9 points.</p>\n<p>This game works for both Computer and Mobile devices. (Note: it may say WebGL Build not supported for mobile devices, just ignore that lol)</p>\n<p>Controls for mobile -&gt; touch the side you want to turn/steer your machine. There are arrows on screen to help, so touch those if your inputs aren't working.</p>\n<p>Controls for Computer -&gt; same as the mobile, touch near the arrows to turn, but you can also use the left and right arrow keys to turn!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this game!
