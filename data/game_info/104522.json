The two have conversed exclusively through messages in bottles tossed back and forth at sea. After seven years, Loren is coming to visit Eliot, and they want to commemorate the occasion with a special and suitable gift. <br/></p>\n<p>They decide on a seaglass necklace, and it's up to the player to obtain it! <br/><br/><strong>INSTRUCTIONS &amp; REQUIREMENTS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>seaglass is currently Windows only. However, it can be run on other operating systems with the use of another program. I recommend Wine, a free program for running Windows programs on other machines. It's straightforward, and this is a helpful article on it! </p>\n<p>On any operating system, seaglass requires the RPG Maker XP Run Time Package to run. It can be downloaded here for free. Download the RPG Maker XP version and install it on your computer, then open the game!<br/></p>\n<p>The game is played with arrow keys for navigation, space bar to interact with people and things, and the ESC key to open and close menus.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Have fun!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f0b/f0bb2b5b20c04cdb6e22d581c490f575.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thepumpkinsnake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
