Slide batteries, lasers and mirrors around to light the  targets within the given shift count. With 128 levels Luma will keep you  occupied for hours and test your puzzling skills to the max.\r\n Play in Normal mode and try to complete the levels within a  designated number of shifts, and return to where you left off using  level codes on each level. Or if you are feeling like a more casual game  play in Practice mode to test any of the levels with no shift limits.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a GBA port from Shallan's C64 game which can be found here. A physical GBA cartridge release can be purchased from PhoenixWare, with my cut going to a local foodbank charity.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>GBA Port: Mark Watkin\u00a0<br/>Game Concept &amp; Graphics: Simon Jameson\r\n <br/>Music: Ma2e/DSR (original by Mike Richmond)\r\n <br/>Testing: MHZ, WauloK, Gray Defender, Retrobreak Nick\r\n <br/>Cover Art: John Blythe\r\n <br/>Level Designs: Airjuri, Akmafin, Amok, Chiswicked, Eldritch, Furroy,  MrG8472, OldSkoolCoder, Phaze101, RichmondMike, Shallan, SpiritHund,  Stepz, Void, Waulok, WizardNJ, ZooperDan\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:53:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64e/64ea8ef35878098da6959b894ff23399.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pmprog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
