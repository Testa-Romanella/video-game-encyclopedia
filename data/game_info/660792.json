The game fits the game jam theme \"combine incompatible\" in two ways:</p>\n<p>1. It is a game both about pizza and pineapples: two INCOMPATIBLE foods.</p>\n<p>2. It combines cooking and fighting: two seemingly INCOMPATIBLE game genres.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to make as many pizzas as possible.\u00a0To make pizzas let tomatoes and cheese into the oven.\u00a0Each piece of cheese is worth two pizzas and\u00a0each tomato is worth one pizza. Be careful though! You can lose quickly in two ways.\u00a0If 3 pineapples reach the oven the pizza integrity is compromised and it's game over (Shown With Gold Hearts).\u00a0And if the chef is hit by the pineapples 3 times he dies and it's game over\u00a0(Shown\u00a0With Red\u00a0Hearts). To stop the pineapples from hurting you or the oven you must shoot them with your blaster. Remember the blaster can hurt the tomatoes and cheese too so think about how you use it.\u00a0Good luck!</p>\n<p>(MADE BY BOSSYDUCK)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T19:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e746ef1a2c5b4f9164e1aa43ed92dbca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Bossyduck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
