Additional levels. Engrossing, but silly, story and lore. Tower special abilities. Enhanced animations and sound effects. Additional musical cues.<br/></p>\n<p> - It is important for this Copy Writer to inform you of the awe felt by working with this extremely talented team. You'll want to follow these peeps' careers if you like games of the \"video\" persuasion.</p>\n<p>- While disappointed that the version presented does not support all the developed features, isn't this one heck of a polished and pretty game?
