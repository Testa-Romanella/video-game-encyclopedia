Or, as they more affectionately known, \"eki-melo\" (\r\n\u99c5\u30e1\u30ed (eki-melo)\r\n). These melodies are played to alert passengers that a train is about to depart.</p>\n<p>This ArtCart contains the melodies that I heard each day on my commute.\u00a0The two melodies played at Kamata Station (\u84b2\u7530\u99c5) are my favorite \r\n\u99c5\u30e1\u30ed eki-melo. Even now, having lived in Japan since 2014, I get nostalgic when I hear those melodies.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\r\n\u99c5\u30e1\u30ed eki-melo are a charming part of the Japanese soundscape.\u00a0The idea to share this cool aspect of Japan via\u00a0an\u00a0ArtCart was inspired by\u00a0Robert Doman's YouTube video on alternative uses for GB Studio.</p>\n<p>Perhaps others who have visited\u00a0 or currently reside in\u00a0Japan have their own favorite\u00a0\r\n\u99c5\u30e1\u30ed eki-melo.
