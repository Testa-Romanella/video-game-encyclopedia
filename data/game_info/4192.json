{"id": 4192, "slug": "pid", "name": "Pid", "name_original": "Pid", "description": "<p>Pid is a puzzle platformer that follows a boy named Kurt who lives in the era of interstellar traveling. Accidentally he missed his planet on the way from school, and got stuck in the place that seemed to have no way out\u2026 Now he needs to find out what happens and return home.<br />\nThe gameplay is based on platforming mixed with Kurt\u2019s ability to use so-called beams to pass through levels. These beams create tunnels without gravity that help to come over obstacles, solve puzzles and even fight enemies. More items become available on higher levels. The game only supports co-op on the same console, with no online multiplayer.<br />\nWhile Pid has really hardcore gameplay, its visual style is calm and relaxing. The in-game world is full of secrets and collectibles that balance the gaming experience a little. Almost every NPC has something to tell you, so don&#39;t ignore dialogues that will shed some light on Pid&#39;s lore.</p>", "metacritic": 63, "released": "2012-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:38:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d93/d93e93149d781484bfc9c6ae7b48e1d4.jpg", "website": "http://www.pidgame.com", "rating": 2.62, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 129, "owned": 2353, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 71, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 176, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 176, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Might and Delight"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["D3 Publisher", "Might and Delight"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
