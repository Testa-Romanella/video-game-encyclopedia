They're fussy about them as well, and demand a specific offering from you, the Novice Adulator. Find the right one and deliver it to the place of adulation, so the Supreme Beings don't destroy everything. While you're wandering around, talk to some of the locals and find out what they think about their overlords. Avoid the gaze of The Watchers who do not like Adulators. They can look vertically and horizontally, but can't look through blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>To Play</strong><br/>Control your character with the arrow keys.<br/>Arrow keys do everything in this game - move and interact with objects and characters.<br/>If in doubt just press the arrow keys!</p>\n<p><strong>My idea</strong><br/>I wanted to create a retro style maze game in Bitsy with more game play than my previous Bitsy games. I managed to include a couple of puzzles in it. (1) Choosing the right offering based on a sequence puzzle at the top of the screen. (2) Choosing the right paths through The Watcher rooms. I had other puzzle ideas, but ran out of time. Originally I planned to create the mazes, text and tiles/sprites/items with a tool I'd developed to generate them randomly, but that didn't work out. However, most of the graphics are tweaked versions of the original random tiles, and a lot of the character and item text was randomly generated as well.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Adam Le Doux for making Bitsy.</p>\n<p>Created for Ludum Dare April 2020.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db1e984fd2eb381471fc9e9c5263850.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AshG"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
