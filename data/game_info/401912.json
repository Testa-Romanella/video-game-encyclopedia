However, after spending 3 whole days being displeased with my control scheme I decided to change the scope and save myself the headache. Not much here, but I really enjoy how the ship controls turned out so I am still going to post the entry. Will have to use this for something bigger in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T01:50:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bba/bbaa088d714693012f2e68a9856a7522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DeepFriedOreo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
