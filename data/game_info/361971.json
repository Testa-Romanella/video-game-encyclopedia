A group of robbers has broken into your home and you only have one bullet to fend them off. Thankfully, you have the ability to slow down time and guide the bullet to take out all of your foes at once! Your bullet can ricochet off of walls and objects, but doing this will increase your speed and eventually get your bullet stuck.<br/><br/>A mouse is recommended for play, but the game is also controllable with keyboard or controller.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T01:04:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5b/f5b589013bd0353263f8973a5557d7e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EthanTheHuman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
