{"id": 921447, "slug": "spread-the-mess", "name": "Spread the mess!", "name_original": "Spread the mess!", "description": "<p>A man sits in front of me in the train to Wageningen. He has dark and grey hair, wears glasses and reads in the newspaper. Sometimes his eyes are closed for a longer time and his heads drops for a short time. The Volkskrant in his hands show an article about familytrees, chickenmeat containing lots of antibiotica and an interview with famous Marie Kondo.</p>\n\n\n<p>The train stops and the man wakes up, grabs his bag and leaves the train before the doors are closing again. As he stands up I realise that I know him from uni. I wonder what such a creative mind dreams in those short train naps.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re presenting you the prototype of our surreal split screen game. It is played by two people - with keyboard and mouse (player A) and controller (player B). You will face each other as bacteria and chicken and spread the mess in the kitchen. The bacteria expands his family, while the chicken tries to fight the spread of bacteria everywhere. Who\u2019s going to win?</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Important: The keyboard player starts first by pressing Spacebar. The controller player starts by pressing X on the PS4 controller. This order is important.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T22:41:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cf/9cfb84190d715d457720ea92a83c6cf8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tom Renkema"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
