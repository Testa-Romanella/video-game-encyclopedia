It is a Halloween-themed Mario game due to its original planned release date, which was around the Halloween period. However, the game originally missed this deadline, going into hiding for nearly a year and finally re-appearing on the internet in a finished state in October 2005.</p>\n<p>Blue Twilight is often considered the best completed Mario title on MFGG, rivaling Jeff Silvers&#39;s Super Mario Epic games and Thunder Dragon&#39;s Toad Strikes Back. It is also one of MFGG&#39;s star attractions, as it was featured on the American channel G4, and more specifically, &#39;The attack of the show&#39;s &#39;Freeplay Friday&#39;. &quot;Mario Fan Game Gallery&quot; was also mentioned at the time, which generated a lot of traffic for MFGG, even though &quot;Galaxy&quot; was replaced with &quot;Gallery&quot;. The amount of traffic put huge strains on MFGG&#39;s server at the time, with the highest number of guests ever recorded at the site.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-25T03:16:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a37/a374b2c6ac23d56738ae3827402282f4.jpg", "website": "https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb&c=2&id=1963&param=02", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blazefire Productions"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Blazefire Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
