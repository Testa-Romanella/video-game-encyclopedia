The game has to be \"easy\" in some way and has reference to theme \"No Enemies\". In this game your objective is to throw as many floating junks to corresponding color bin as you can. If you throw them to wrong bin, you lose.</p>\n<p>The game supports both mouse and smartphone's accelerometer. I did my best to make them playable in the same way in reasonable time. My aim was to create a very simple yet fun game that requires almost no controls and playable both on Android and Web. I spent about 20 hours to make this game, mostly 2 last days before deadline.<br/></p>\n<p>I would like you to leave feedback. I had many concerns about my choices so it understandable the game/prototype/concept can be further improved and even maybe published on Google Play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T12:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d08/d08fd425c02afc47ea195607c0825a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Kiel97"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
