Did you just throw a sandal at me? I\u2019m leaving now.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a shoe box, you love your owner dearly, but, one day, your owner leaves you behind at a hotel by mistake. You\u2019ll do anything to reunite with them, even if that means growing legs and walking out the door!<h3>Forms</h3>The shoe box can take two forms, Leg Form and Box Form. In box form, you're lower to the ground and can sneak around much more easily. In leg form, you're faster, taller, can see farther, but run the risk of getting caught much more easily.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While in leg form, you can also use the different shoes you collect to help solve the game's many challenging puzzles, or to completely ruin somebody's day. Kick down paintings, break toilets, and smash pots with your trusty boots. Stun enemies, activate levers, and exude the style and grace of a Dad with your socks and sandals! <br/><br/><br/><br/>At the end of each area, you\u2019ll be able to hop into an even bigger box or box-like item to take control of it. Starting off as a humble, unassuming shoe box, who knows how big you\u2019ll have to get to reunite with your owner?<br/><br/><br/><br/>During your journey, collect charms for your owner\u2019s clogs, known as Shoo-dads, by completing a variety of hidden in-game achievements. Will you collect them all?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-10T17:36:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/885/8855b1df97a1e2682145dd177fae8111.jpg", "website": "https://discord.gg/zzcngpS", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["schwizzlers", "Jake Crabtree", "Redsyi", "leganddairy", "Leg n Dairy Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Leg n Dairy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
