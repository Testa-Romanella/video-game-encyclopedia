Narratively I was inspired but the episode of futurama where hermies controls a small armada perfectly in sync to destroy gold death stars blockading earth.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I tried having the thrusters on the other ships fire the way they were pointing when they attached but it was not fun , hence the thrust and mass system I have now. I went though a similar process with the weapons.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I think I have been reading too many TWABs about destiny because I got quite invested in the idea of a power fantasy built on controlling a massive multi gunned ship destroying all in your path.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>If I had time I would have made the spawns random but with a time limit it is easier to make sure the spawns are balanced by doing it manually rather then setting up a series of rules for the randomization\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>I\u2019m not an artist or programmer so the game is fairly rough around the edges but I hope the core concept is fun enough for people to have a good time with it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec4/ec4662fd8b1e08a8e9e72539ebc915b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laurie Hardman"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
