And we used the optional theme SIDE-EFFECTS.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The side effects we used are: when you get bitten by a snake, you get poisoned, which results in losing score. When you touch the camp fire, you start burning, which also results in losing score. When you get hit by a barrel\u00a0you start hobbling.</p>\n<p>This project was made in a week by a group of 4 people:</p>\n<p>- Marcos Engelhard: Programmer;\u00a0https://marcos-engelhard.itch.io/</p>\n<p>- Ricardo\u00a0Oliveira: Game Designer, Level Designer and Sound Designer;</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Francisco Silva: Pixel artist (assets and level);\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Jenifer Lagoa\u00e7a:\u00a0Pixel artist (main character and animals);\u00a0https://itch.io/profile/jeniwg;</p><p>Controls:\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0- Movement: AD;</p><p>\u00a0- Climb up: W;</p><p>\u00a0- Climb down: S;</p><p>\u00a0- Jump: Space;</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T08:20:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38f/38f503043ff53a058a105590b35934e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Marcos Engelhard", "Mecawolf", "Jeniwg"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
