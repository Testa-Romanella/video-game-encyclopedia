In the game there are suddenly appearing arachnids. It is not recommended for people who do not tolerate spider-like creatures and people with weak psyche, nerves and cardiovascular diseases.</strong></p><p>You play as Ron Weasley. The goal of the game is to break all the vases into locations. You will be hindered by Lucius Malfoy, dealing damage with his broom. Your character can't do damage to anyone except vases. You will have to run away from Lucius, hide, use a teleport (kettle), or a cave. But be careful! Frequent use of the cave can cause spiders. They are completely safe and do not cause any harm to Ron Weasley, but they may seem scary to some people with a phobia of spiders. Controls: WASD - running, camera overview with the mouse, left click - kick, space - jump. This game is a joke, and nothing but a joke. All the characters in the game are adults.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T06:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ef/7efbe020372c8573b9205172e2fcba50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kinder And Doll"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
