In it, the player faces eight other AI-controlled enemies in a deathmatch for points.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Each character features a distinct playstyle to toy with, from teleportation attacks to aimed explosions. They are: VELN, TARK, SHOT, DASH, BOOM, NOVA, IRIS, KOSM and LUNA.</p>\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nVELN\u00a0\r\n\n<p>A speedy triangle capable of killing anyone that touches it.</p>\r\nTARK\r\n\n<p>A mighty, tanky square that can take two hits. Its attack is a short charge.</p>\r\nSHOT\r\n\n<p>A capable and relatively fast shooter that unleashes volleys of bullets upon its enemies.</p>\r\nDASH\r\n\n<p>A quick dasher whose power is to teleport\u00a0through the environment and kill anyone between the points of departure and arrival. Can also activate\u00a0a shield.</p>\r\nBOOM\r\n\n<p>A powerful hexagon that can create shorts bursts of explosion anywhere within its range. This power has no cooldown.</p>\r\nNOVA\r\n\n<p>A devastating 5-pointed star that attacks with big, cross-shaped blasts. These powers, however, have a long cooldown, which can be cut down in half with good timing.</p>\r\nIRIS\r\n\n<p>A deadly sniper that can increase its field of view at the cost of movement. Its attacks have almost infinite range.</p>\r\nKOSM\r\n\n<p>A smart diamond that has 4 revolving squares spinning around it. Their range can be adjusted, and their speed can be increased momentarily.</p>\r\nLUNA\r\n\n<p>A stealthy 4-pointed star that can phase between planes, killing anyone nearby when it gets back to the normal plane.</p>\r\nNEMESIS\r\n<p>The game also has a Nemesis System, in which two random enemies become significantly more powerful at the start of the game. One of them becomes a rival to the player, sticking with its Nemesis status throughout the entire game. The other Nemesis loses its powers after death, and a new Nemesis is randomly chosen. With this, the game becomes more dynamic, as different rivals appear during the course of the match.</p>\r\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\r\n<p>The game has 4 background songs to choose from (all from Kevin MacLeod), an option to turn the Nemesis System on and off, and a setting for the target score, enabling the player to choose their length of play.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T04:42:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c706f3c2226794c5f582687d638072b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MasterProject"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
