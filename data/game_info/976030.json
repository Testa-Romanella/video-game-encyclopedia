Certain characters will have their signature lines, such as Yab's \"Ki sa la vole mon can-nard\", or \"Koif\u00e9 la\" for Kaniar Lakour.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpdates to the game will be regular and free of charge (new characters, new locations and new game modes).", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-02T06:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658a190a1f4368d223dbdb11989273ab.jpg", "website": "http://www.darieproductions.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darie Productions"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Darie Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
