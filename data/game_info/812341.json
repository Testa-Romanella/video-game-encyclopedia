In the future I plan to come back and reinsert all the missing features i had planned. Feel free to give any feedback, but keep this in mind.</p>\n<p>I hope you like my game, this was my first time participating in a game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T08:37:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39e9891b0e1bb61e85bca43c3b208681.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Masterttt123"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
