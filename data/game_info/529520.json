A family that coincidentally enough has never had a break. Their previous castle was destroyed by a poorly placed meteor while they were on vacation. Their next castle was burned down after the chef spilled vegetable oil on a flame, and the castle after that was flooded by the nearby river after weeks of rainfall. All of this has left them gloomy and tensions between the residents are at an all time high, and this current storm is forcing all of them to stay trapped inside the castle with each other. King and Queen Misfortune, along with their child, the prince, were sharing the castle with their butler, chef, and an outsider when the storm hit. One morning, as people made their way to the dining hall for breakfast, the Queen discovered the King\u2019s body hunched over the dining table with a knife stuck in his back. She must solve the question, who killed the King?</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Player count requirement: 5</p>\n<p>Approximate play time: 5-10 minutes</p>\n<p>Where to play:\u00a0https://playingcards.io/jy8pxa</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T06:48:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/697/697be5d7da04b1e487194dcf89bf46fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxwellMollison"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
