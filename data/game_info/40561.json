{"id": 40561, "slug": "conquest", "name": "Conquest", "name_original": "Conquest", "description": "Conquest is a VR exclusive game that aims to combine the fun from RTS games with the sense of progression that comes from RPG games. You start off alone in a forest, with no army or resources. You must combat skillful AI enemies throughout this large open world to earn gold and experience. As you level up you can progress through 8 different skill trees (Bow, Blunt, Block, Blade, Command, Agility, Halberd), all of which incorporate VR's capabilities. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOnce you earn enough gold you can construct a village and raise an army. As you and your army wonder the world, if enemy villages see you they will sound their war horn and you will be at war. You must protect your village and lay siege to the enemy village to survive.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Ywy2UHQgRv", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T03:01:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f63/f63f95b7e14b6955db8a356b88fc7b74.jpg", "website": "http://www.conquest-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Proxy Studios", "Sean O'Connor", "Endless Endeavor"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Board Games", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sean O'Connor", "Proxy Studios", "Endless Endeavor"], "esrb_rating": null}
