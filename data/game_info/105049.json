Now they've trapped all of the poor slimes in crystals and triggered a terrible eruption. Lucky for them, vacationing heroine Jelli was busy at a day spa when it happened. It's up to her to bounce and trounce a path through invaders and save her fellow slimians!</p><p>I'm basically out of time to work on this, so I'm releasing it as-is. There are three worlds and a ton of rooms in each one. Should take around 15 minutes to beat, if it's beatable.</p><p>CONTROLS</p><p>Escape - Pause</p><p>Left and Right - Movement</p><p>Up - Open door/Save slime from crystal/Talk/Activate heart shrine/Progress message boxes</p><p>Down - Drop down through thin platforms</p><p>Space - Jump/Switch between maps</p><p>Z - Hold to change to blob form/Swap between map and collection display/Exit from card menu back to main menu</p><p>While in blob form, Jelli will bounce off of walls and enemies. Hit an enemy while in blob form to knock them out.</p><p>Jelli's trajectory can't be changed while in blob form. Release Z in mid air after bouncing to maneuver your way through the air.</p><p>Collect gems to open doors of their respective colors. Requires 15 gems of the door's respective color.</p><p>Slimes trapped in crystals require 10 cyan gems to save.</p><p>Orange and cyan (not used) heart shrines add a temporary extra 4 HP in exchange for 5 of their respective gems.</p><p>Stone blocks will break when bounced against. This will also break all connected stone blocks. They'll reappear after a second or two.</p><p>There are three hidden cards in each world. Collected cards are (aka should be) saved between game startups.</p><p>There's no penalty for dying and Jelli will quickly respawn back at the nearest door or pink flower.</p><p>Pressing 1, 2, or 3 while on the main menu will instantly take you to the first room of that world. Pressing K will instantly kill Jelli.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6db/6db1d5fcd9367aff5d55f5366a477bb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vonfawks"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
