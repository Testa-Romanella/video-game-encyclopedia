You as the player get to hand the jesters tools in order for them to get past obstacles that may be in their way. You will not be able to directly control each jester as they move automatically on their own. The available tools range from a Holy Bomb to a stop sign, so there are different combinations of the tools that the player can choose to do in order to complete each puzzle in the levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582c8df911516db9d1d4b8271351c432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KDU Glenmarie Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
