{"id": 958586, "slug": "searing-demo", "name": "SeaRing DEMO", "name_original": "SeaRing DEMO", "description": "<p>SeaRing is a 2D indie action-puzzle, putting a devilish twist on its predecessors by flipping the script and making defending the only way to attack. Submerge yourself in a world rich in lore, and be taken on a journey full of colourful and often comical storytelling, as you join the Princess of the Sea in a nostalgic quest to recover her mother\u2019s lost crown, become queen, and restore peace in a world now ruled by fire.<br/><br/>As you leave the Water Kingdom behind to venture into the desert, you\u2019ll meet witty and humorous NPCs, witness astonishing backdrops, and be carried by a soothing soundtrack! Will the Princess conquer her foolish foes OR succumb to the pressure and leave her hopes and dreams to dissipate along with the rest of the desert?</p>\n<p>\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164<br/><br/><strong>So you\u2019re the girl who wants to cross the desert?</strong><br/><br/>Embark on the sea Princess\u2019s journey to retrieve her mother\u2019s lost crown by venturing far from the water and into the uncharted and dangerous realm of fire, a desert where the sun never sets, ruled by the sadistic Saladino and his seven deadly servants. The mission? Accomplish your mother\u2019s last wish and set claim to the sea throne, so that tranquility can return to the kingdom and the moon can once again set a natural pace to the sea\u2019s tide.</p>\n<p>\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164<br/><br/><strong>Trust in the power of the Sea Ring.</strong><br/><br/>The twist? You will have no harpoons, tridents, or turtle shells of any colour. You must solely rely on the Sea Ring. The Sea Ring... is a ring\u2026 of the sea, and yes, it\u2019s the title of our game! Passed on by generations, you can summon its defensive capabilities to briefly protect you from imminent danger. The best form of attack is to defend, and we push this famous sports philosophy to its limit!</p>\n<p>\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164<br/><br/><strong>Explore a rich world filled with art, music, humour and lore!</strong><br/><br/>Brace yourself for a journey through luscious landscapes and be propelled by an adventurous soundtrack, as you set off to vanquish those who stand in your way, starting with Saladino and his posse of good-for-nothing bandits. Encounter challenging puzzles and puzzling challenges, interact with over 50 (sometimes questionable) NPCs and explore 100s of unique dialogue lines, as you dive deeper into enemy territory. How much you rely on them is up to you - they may help you, share insightful recollections as you study the game\u2019s lore, or cause a slight distraction through hilarity as they derail you from your mission.</p>\n<p>\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164\u3164<br/><br/><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>You can\u2019t ATTACK?!</strong>\u00a0\u201cHow do I kill my enemies then?\u201d Well\u2026 you technically don\u2019t. Channel your inner pacifist as you use your Sea Ring to see off any enemy attacks, in true Sea Princess fashion. The Sea Ring can also be used to interact with objects, which will provide usefulness in situations outside of combat (hopefully).<br/>\n</li><li><strong>So about the NPCs\u2026\u00a0</strong>I guess you don\u2019t have to talk to them but we encourage you to! Some are a bit out there, others actually pretty funny (if you give them the chance to be), and some can be really helpful too, giving you well-needed tips as you explore the lore of this game. With over 50 of them, and 100s of unique dialogue, we\u2019re sure they\u2019ll help you get to your destination! Just don\u2019t pay too much attention to the weird ones\u2026<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Sea Princess Calls Home:</strong>\u00a0<em>ring ring. ring ring.\u00a0</em>It\u2019s not everyday that a Sea Princess gets lost in the desert.
