Watch out for platforms and jump pads which may return to their original state as you control new objects!</p>\n<p><strong>Genre: Puzzle Platformer<br/></strong><strong>Platform: Windows<br/></strong><strong>Singleplayer</strong></p>\n\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p><strong>Premise:</strong></p>\n<p>Momentum is a light puzzle platformer, set in a place where the technology is run on the forces of time. In order to sustain it, time has been harvested from several timelines. Due to this harvest, the time continuum has started to fall apart.</p>\n<p>It is up to you to find the time vault and release time back into the world. You will face challenges as you traverse this which will test your ability in timing and planning.</p>\n<p>To your aid, you have a tool which can directly control the time energy the technology is run on. But the tool\u2019s power is not unlimited and it cannot maintain the control of all objects at once. Due to its restrictions, you need to carefully time and plan in order to progress.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p>Momentum is a student project at the school FutureGames. It was made during 7 weeks. We hope you will enjoy our game!</p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>: Hanna Frid\u00e9n \u2013 Charlotte Barnekow \u2013 Marco Turzynski<br/><strong>Programming</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0Olivia Follin \u2013 Vilde Brobacke \u2013 Alexander L\u00f6vberg<br/><strong>3D</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0Tony H\u00f6gye \u2013 Johan Lind \u2013 Oskar Ivarsson<br/><strong>2D</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0Emanuel Axelsson \u2013 Jonatan Sleiers \u2013 Josefin Strand</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T09:23:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3b25d0dbb6fc1ef9bde46b88b02423.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HannaFriden"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
