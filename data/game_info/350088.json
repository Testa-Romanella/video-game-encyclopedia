It is used to purchase early game upgrades, however if the user collects enough of them they can earn achievements for it.<br/><br/><strong>Premium Coffee Beans:</strong> A rare currency that only increments by 1 every time the user clicks on the coffee bean 100 times. As of right now, they are only used to purchase an upgrade called \"Faster Harvesting.\" Although Faster Harvesting is a very useful upgrade in the game, more uses for Premium Coffee Beans are planned for the future.<br/><br/><strong>Money:</strong> Exactly as it sounds. However, this currency is not unlocked until a certain point in the game. Very useful currency indeed.<br/><br/>There are 12 Achievements to unlock as of right now, and also an (experimental) stocks option where the player can purchase stocks in-game and possibly increase (or decrease!) their currency later on when selling them...<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the game too much, but there is far more than what I just said above inside this game, and there is also a lot more planned for the future. Enjoy!<br/><br/>This game is always in an undergoing state of change, it is planned to be updated very frequently and (constructive please) user input is always welcome.<br/><br/><strong>Expected Playtime:</strong> Anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, although progress in the game can happen indefinitely. The average playtime is expected to gradually increase with the release of new features.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/5259606319eae70361fb264f8e263e09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aaror874"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["aaror874"], "esrb_rating": null}
