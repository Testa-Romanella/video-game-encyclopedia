It's your task to figure out who the killer is before it is too late!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use the mouse to select a suspect, and to arrest them. Clicking anywhere else will deselect them.</p>\r\nHints:\r\n<p>The killer will prioritize nearby targets, but will shoot one at random if nobody is nearby.
