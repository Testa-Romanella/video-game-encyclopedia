{"id": 159845, "slug": "heart-beat-2kcarlos", "name": "Heart Beat (2kCarlos)", "name_original": "Heart Beat (2kCarlos)", "description": "<p>Heart Beat was an introductory project that I made with a partner, using Unity.<br/><br/>The idea was to have a 2D platformer game, where the objective was to collect hearts to keep the heart beat going. Over time, the heart beat's rate would decrease over time, until it would get too slow and the game would end, resulting in failure. Then, we added cigarettes that hinder the heart beat rate\u2014an incentive for the player to jump over and avoid those in the game. There is no finite end, or any way to actually win, because the level is generated procedurally as the player advances farther.<br/><br/>This version of the game has a lot of bugs and incomplete graphics work, due to time restrictions. It is unlikely that the game will be developed any further.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/82683d18fc09ab8e4a00fec0f55d35e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2kCarlos"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
