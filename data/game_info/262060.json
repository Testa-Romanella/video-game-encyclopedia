This game simulates real-life situations that happen every day on trading floors. You are a trader starting with $10. The autotrader starts with $100 and never misses a good deal. The rules are simple: BUY and SELL and you bankrupt the autotrader or the autotrader takes your innings. Like the real world, the more $wealth you amassed, the easier it is to bankrupt others. The only way to bankrupt the AUTOTRADER in this game is by taking over the market through amassing sufficient $wealth in the market.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d70b30409b33ab01cfe9e920385a833d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alanjpan"], "genres": ["RPG", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
