As president, you will use the device to navigate the hypothetical administration of one commander-in-chief as he attempts to survive the slings and arrows of U.S. political life, in a town where everyone is out to get everyone else and every choice you make is wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Your decisions have consequences:\u00a0</strong>Every decision you take as president will have consequences for your political career, for America, and for the world. Cabinet nominations, sanctions regimes, backroom deals with foreign nations - how you navigate the administration in an uncertain world will determine whether you survive your tenure in office.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Byzantine scenarios:\u00a0</strong>How do you respond to China's illegal construction of artificial islands outside of its territory? Will you intervene to stop a merger that would empower a media company unfavourable to you? Do you lean on the Department of Justice to influence its investigation into your shady past? These conundrums and more will confront you as you attempt to keep the government afloat.</p>\n<p><strong>Numerous story paths:\u00a0</strong>Your political opponents will stop at nothing to see your administration destroyed. Your foreign adversaries would like nothing more than to see the United States brought to heel. Whether you give them the satisfaction is down to you. Survive, be forced to resign, be impeached, bring the world to the brink of war; the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>Mod support: </strong>Write your own interactive adventure directly into the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Ensure continuity of government.
