Well, most video games portray death in a negative way, like an obstacle or failure. The question of this game is 'Does death always have to be a negative?' Anyway, turned into a walking simulator because of time constraints, but it's always fun to try and break convention.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Death</li><li>Walking</li><li>Pixels</li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><p>[WASD] - Move</p><p>[X] - Interact</p><p><strong>A Game a Week [Week 8]:</strong><br/></p><p>This game is my eighth game for \"a game a week\". Every week, I will force myself to make and release a (terrible) game. It's like a ransom, except games instead of hostages...probably. You can follow my progress on twitter (@enathang) or on my website (pixelmancer.io).
