You play as a Slug who joins a mysterious Wizard on a rescue mission. The Wizard will independently support you in various ways, mainly by casting spells during boss battles. Your main weapon is your own regenerating body. Attack by ejecting parts of your body at your foes, quickly regenerate and grow with a button press and repeat. The world has its own mythology and is filled with strange creatures and characters, some of which can aid you in your adventure.<br/></p>\n<p>Trailer:</p>\n\n<p>---Features---<br/></p>\n<p>-Action platforming as a Slug</p>\n<p>-A.I companions</p>\n<p>-Not your typical fairy tale story</p>\n<p>-Story mode and Arcade mode (which cuts out the story and gets you into the action)</p>\n<p>-Charming art style</p>\n<p>-Original soundtrack blending 8-16 bit with jazz and orchestral flair. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a75fa5440cfca4c329622eb5f0fb940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silkworm Sweatshop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
