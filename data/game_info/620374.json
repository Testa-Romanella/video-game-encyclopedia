We thought about mashing sheep together...but that was kind of weird and grotesque to. So instead we thought of clouds!</p>\n<p>This game relates to the theme both in that the main mechanic is to join together clouds to make it rain, and in that to perform the rain dance, you must control the snakedragon, and the \"rain spirit\" inside, both together, moving with symmetry, trying to achieve harmony to make it rain.<br/></p>\n<p>Initially you controlled the two dragons separately, but that was really hard. And it looked really cool when you could kind of move them together symmetrically. So we thought, why not make <em>that </em>the default way to move?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This made it much easier to control, but also really fun just to move around and create different patterns. <br/><br/>We later decided to add the concept of \"pious\" villagers. Those that believe in the snakedragon and pray to it, and those that don't. Choosing to bring rain to these pious farms, marked by the idols in their land, or choosing to bring rain to all, brings about different ending scenarios. <br/></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy soaring above the skies and dancing with the rain spirit. We appreciate you taking the time to play and any feedback you have!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:36:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5a546f973cc2e12668dc5b621840ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["omarshehata", "MacEnhizer", "Celia S.
