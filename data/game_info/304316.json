{"id": 304316, "slug": "rashlander", "name": "RASHLANDER", "name_original": "RASHLANDER", "description": "RASHLANDER is a physics-loaded lunar lander roguelike that feels like spinning across an icy road and nailing a perfect parallel park. Inspired by arcade classics such as Sinistar and Asteroids as well as neo-retro games like Downwell, RASHLANDER's controls are simple, pure, and easy to learn with successful gameplay relying heavily on a little luck and a ton of skill.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The procedurally generated levels force players to build ability instead of learning set patterns, paving the way for a challenging experience and truly triumphant wins. Discover a dense network of game-changing upgrade systems and life-giving fuel stations\u2014all while attempting to achieve the highest score in this skill-based, physics-stuffed tribute to the golden era of arcades.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After not quite seeing eye-to-eye with an all-powerful global entity known as GovCorp, a small team of terraforming researchers are forced to flee Earth in a hastily-prepared escape rocket. Things are a little less than ideal, however. Navigating a ship equipped with a highly explosive plutonium core nestled in the nose and a perpetually low fuel supply can get a little squirrely. You\u2019ll need to skillfully slingshot around levels\u2014dodging interstellar debris, scraping past gravity-heavy asteroids, and avoiding GovCorp drones\u2014to successfully crash-land onto the goal-marked warp pads. Careful though, you\u2019ll want to land your ship feet-first unless you\u2019re a fan of incinerating your entire crew in super-explodey collisions.<br/><br/><strong>FEATURES</strong><br/><ul><li>Neo-retro lunar lander roguelike: offers a modern arcade experience to hardcore gamers, with a strong pick-up-and-play appeal.
