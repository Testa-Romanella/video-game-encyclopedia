{"id": 112861, "slug": "i-need-a-doctor", "name": "I Need A Doctor!", "name_original": "I Need A Doctor!", "description": "<p><em>I Need A Doctor!</em> is a third person action game developed by 10 students as the capstone project for Mercer County Community College's Game Design degree.</p><p>\r\nThe objective of the game is simple: you're bleeding to death and you need medical attention immediately. The only problem, besides bleeding profusely, is that you've been dropped off at the worst hospital imaginable- there's only one doctor in the entire facility and it's crawling with infectious gases that will hasten your already rapidly-decaying state.</p><p>It's not all bad though, there are 4 different types of power-ups that you can find scattered throughout the randomly-generated hospital to aid you on your quest to find the elusive doctor.</p><p>Good Luck, and we hope you enjoy the game!</p><p>Please feel free to send any comments or questions to RaymondHess3@Gmail.com</p><p>Music Credit:\u00a0\"George Street Shuffle\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\u00a0Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\u00a0http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75b/75b2ad9066a149f072d0a76e99df6f1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MCCC"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
