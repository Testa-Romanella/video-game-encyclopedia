The players are set in isolation on an island - time stands still and nothing appears as it seems. While unraveling the mysteries and secrets of the island in hopes of escape the players are faced with opposing forces originating from a hidden world only experienceable by sound. To aid the players in their quest they are equipped with the ability of throwing grenades of\u00a0out sound waves that reveal the second world on impact. Mystical artefacts are spread throughout the island, which the player has to find. Cooperating the players have to find a way to leave the lone shores behind and set out into the unknown.</p>\n<p><strong><br/>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Lucas H\u00fcbner - 3D Art | Programming</p>\n<p>Juro Carl Anton Reinhardt\u00a0- Sound Design | Level Design</p>\n<p>Leon-Etienne K\u00fchr - Visual Programming | Environment Art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T09:12:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae4da9274a8972c8a063383d9d36228.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kyma"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
