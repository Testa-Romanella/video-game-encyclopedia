Protect it by making snow &amp; ice inside caves, where it\u2019s cold and fortify your castle so it may stand another day!</p>\n\n<p>You start with full water (refill your water from traders), and water\u2019s used for making ice in caves. Specifically, you have to enter a cave, find a pond and pour your water in it! It\u2019ll eventually freeze - at that moment, you can collect ice! If you have ice, go quickly to your snowcastle to restore it a little bit!\r\n</p>\n<p>Watch out! Each day, the sun burns more intensely than before! How long can your snowcastle hold out?\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> / <strong>Arrows</strong> - Movement</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0E</strong> - Use</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a00</strong> - Mute\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>+</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 Volume up</p>\n<p><strong>-</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Volume down</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T15:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f220c2ba2a6975cca3832a372176041.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Noiyy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
