{"id": 99042, "slug": "dimlit", "name": "Dimlit", "name_original": "Dimlit", "description": "<p>Dimlit is a Roguelike game played in the terminal with ASCII graphics. You play as a Sage surviving in an apocalyptic world consumed by infinite darkness populated by grues. Your only defense against them and the oppressing darkness are crystalline structures you build, some of which provide light.<br/></p>\n<p> <strong>You \u2014 The Sage</strong></p>\n<p>You are a sage. You cannot attack and you die instantly by any grue attack. You can hold off attacks in the darkness\u00a0\u00a0for a short while\u00a0 with your glow suit, but it can only be powered at a functioning \u00a0crystalline structure. Your glowsuit is your life in the darkness.</p>\n<p>You start off in the center of an infinite map of darkness, with\u00a0 a single crystalline structure next to you providing light. To keep yourself alive you must build more of these structures with crystals found only in the darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>The Crystalline Structures</strong></p>\n<p>Crystalline Structures are essential to the survival of the Sage. You must build more if you wish to survive. You will experience darkness surges and grue attacks which can leave you stranded. The events and attacks cannot be prevented, you must\u00a0be prepared to survive.</p>\n<p>Some structures require power, specifically tech upgrade structures and more advanced structures. You start off with the ability to build a basic power-providing structure\u00a0 aptly named\u00a0\"Power Structure.\" It provides one power to a structure it links to directly next to it (horizontally/vertically).</p>\n<p>Power structures are not the only structures that have links. Explore different structures by unlocking them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Light</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Light is essential. Without it your glowsuit loses and power and you will succumb to the darkness and the grues.\u00a0A larger network of light gives you a safe place to run if a storm or grue takes out your nearby\u00a0structures.</p>\n<p> <strong>The Darkness</strong></p>\n<p>The darkness is infinite, and becomes more oppressive after each turn. The grue population is continuously increasing and dark surges and storms put your protected structures at further risk.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Grues</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Most grues avoid any and all light, however there are some which can withstand the light for a short while to take out structures or attack you. Grues can\u00a0 and should be killed by late game structures. If they aren't, more of them attack you.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is to survive for as long as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sage<ul><li>Move \u2014 HJKL, arrows</li><li>Wait \u2014 Period</li><li>Action \u2014 Space</li></ul><ul><li>Interact with Structure \u2014 Bump into it</li></ul></li><li>Menus / Structure Menus<ul><li>Select \u2014 Space, L</li><li>Back \u2014 Escape, Q, H</li><li>Up/Down \u2014JK</li></ul></li><li>General<ul><li>Quit \u2014 Escape, Q</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Tips</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Keep your glowsuit charged!
