Fight a sequence of enemies, via a board based puzzle combat system.</p>\n\n<p>How to play.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You move the yellow tiles. There are 3 different tile types. Sword, shield, and health. The goal is to defeat the enemy. You do this by placing tiles on to the board. Once two or more tiles of the same type are next to each other, you can click on them and an action will happen. If the tile has a sword on it the enemy will be attacked, shield, and your shield value will increase, health, and your health value will increase. The value of the action is determined by the configuration of the tiles. The more tiles which contribute to a specific action, the more powerful that action is. For example, two tiles has a value of 2. Three tiles in a horizontal or vertical row have a value of 5.</p>\n<p>Here's a table showing the values of particular configurations:</p>\r\nConfigurationValue3 Diagonal tiles6x3 Horizontal or Vertical tiles5x2 Horizontal\u00a0 or Vertical\u00a0Tiles2x2 Diagonal Tiles1x\r\n\n<p>There are special tiles which you will acquire as you progress. These tiles are just subtypes of the 3 main tile types, with additional properties.</p>\n<p>You take one action per turn. An action is placing a tile on the board, or selecting a contiguous tile area to be removed from the board. Turns are ended automatically when you have taken the action.<br/></p>\n<p>If no actions can be taken because the board is full, all the tiles on the board will be destroyed, and you and your opponent will take damage equal to the number of tiles that belong to you that were destroyed. You can't skip turns, so even if you or your opponent could make a move, if you can't on your turn,\u00a0 or your opponent can't on theirs,\u00a0all tiles are destroyed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9c/e9c1487374144c3cc3931dc27f81a046.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aragatodag"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
