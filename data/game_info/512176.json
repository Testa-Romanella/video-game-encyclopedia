But alas, there must come a time when master is severed from tome, and the spark of magic held by the book dwindles into nothing. It seems this time has come for you. You think back on the great deeds achieved by you and your master and all of he lives you have touched. You think to the farthest reaches of your memory as you sentience fades... and remember when you first met your master... in the library. A realization hits you like a freshly engraved arcane sigil, your master had but rented you from the library and you must be returned or your master will be known as little more than, \"Mage of the Overdue Book\". A spark of new purpose comes to light within you, you must escape this liches castle and return yourself to the library.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:34:31", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hyperspace Wizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
