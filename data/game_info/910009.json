While the bare original has full mobile touchscreen compatibility, this version prioritizes the desktop experience by utilizing keyboard and mouse play, while also stretching to be 3x as wide as the original, providing a widescreen experience enjoyable in full screen on desktop computers.</p>\n<p>Astrolabe puts you in the seat of a barrier protection ship, where your goal is not to shoot the most objects, travel the furthest away, or even to protect yourself! Rather, your only goal is to protect the barrier that you are tied to by any means. Unlock upgrades with increasing higher scores to challenge more dangerous planets in the solar system. Can you beat master mode on any of them?</p>\n<p>This project, while complete, may see few updates in the future, however these will likely come as part of a new project similar in mechanics.* Not coming soon though.</p>\n<p>*This future project will likely include more levels, obstacles, upgrades, powerups, and possibly redone art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T07:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5c6d1770ccf7aa4ac28eda5274f2c60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["IXtimes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
