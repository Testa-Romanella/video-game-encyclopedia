Survive as long as you can this journey won't be easy. Using W, S, A, D for movement and Left mouse click to attack. Harvest trees for wood to stack up your wood pile for when night comes. This project was created in about 9 days for the September 2022 MigJam. The theme is Survival with a constraint of DOT (Damage Over Time). I had a fun time making this game and hope there's not too many bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>Player Asset: https://opengameart.org/content/gothicvania-patreons-collection<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/></p>\n\n<p>Forest Walk by Alexander Nakarada | https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Hostiles Inbound by Miguel Johnson | https://soundcloud.com/migueljohnsonmjmusic</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/</p>\n<p>Creative Commons CC BY 3.0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>Chop Off Head With Axe https://freesound.org/people/Smice_6/sounds/536528/</p>\n<p>Hit Swing Sword Small 3 https://freesound.org/people/Eponn/sounds/547041/</p>\n<p>chopping magazine https://freesound.org/people/jchiledred/sounds/445826/</p>\n<p>forest summer Roond 020 200619_0186 https://freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/sounds/530415/</p>\n<p>Spooky humming https://freesound.org/people/lyghtningwither/sounds/595117/</p>\n<p>Kid Ghost Sigh https://freesound.org/people/HorrorAudio/sounds/431979/</p>\n<p>Ghost Snoring 1 https://freesound.org/people/Legnalegna55/sounds/547558/</p>\n<p>GhostGuardian_Attack_01 https://freesound.org/people/STAudio/sounds/490515/</p>\n<p>Ambiance_Fire_Loop https://freesound.org/people/Nox_Sound/sounds/472591/</p>\n<p>meteor fly-by 1 https://freesound.org/people/LiamG_SFX/sounds/323085/</p>\n<p>wood1 https://freesound.org/people/mystiscool/sounds/7139/</p>\n<p>Man getting hit https://freesound.org/people/Under7dude/sounds/163441/</p>\n<p>ouch_2 https://freesound.org/people/sventhors/sounds/421876/</p>\n<p>Man Dying https://freesound.org/people/Under7dude/sounds/163442/</p>\n<p>timber tree falling 1 https://freesound.org/people/matt_beer/sounds/515313/</p>\n<p>collecting_health https://freesound.org/people/rdaly95/sounds/387133/</p>\n<p>one_beep https://freesound.org/people/Kenneth_Cooney/sounds/463202/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T05:52:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cdceb22bc790a0975465eac5d8bd993.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cowboybob"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
