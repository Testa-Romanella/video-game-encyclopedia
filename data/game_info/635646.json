Here are some things you should know before downloading.</p>\n<p>1- This game is a<strong> game designer</strong> student project made with a team of 4 people. It was almost entirely made with the <em>\"PlayMaker\"</em> plugin which allowed us to do visual scripting.<br/></p>\n<p>It does contains some C# scripts that interacts with key gameplay features, as we faced some of the Playmaker's limitations. We are proud and thankful for that, since it boosted our programming skills from zero to...well something !</p>\n<p>2 - The game was made in about 3 months.</p>\n<p>3 - You will be able to experience the idea of the game, understands its vision, but a lot of features are still missing ! You should read the \"how to play section\" in the main menu, as it displays a lot of useful informations (that would otherwise be distilled in the first playthrough of the player.)</p>\n<p>There is also a pdf refering to some of known bugs and issues.</p>\n\n<p>We'd really like your inputs and feedbacks on this prototype.
