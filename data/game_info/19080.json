A heavy burden weighs upon their souls, for now they have to face the Unforgiving Trials.STORY<br/>Every 20 years Corruption spreads across the lands inflicting terror and fear in the hearts of villagers. No one knows the reason for this calamity except the old King who perished when the hordes swarmed the Capital city. Many tried to reach the king in attempt to gain any knowledge or insight to fight the curse. Yet it all proved futile as no one ever returned to tell the tale.

It is up to him to recruit a party of the very best adventurers: knights, wizards, thieves and oddballs. Recruit whoever it takes to reach the old King and reclaim the lands of man. While your quest seems straightforward it is certainly not an easy task as vile beasts and threatening monstrosities lurk the realm, ready to strike you down at the first sign of weakness.GAMEPLAY<br/>Embark on an epic adventure to save the lands.

Every member of our team is a fan of old school JRPG genre. It's our dream to revitalize its turn based battle system witch is shunned more and more every year in favor of more action oriented combat. For this reason we decided that our first project will be battle oriented JRPG in order to reignite the passion of old school turn based combat.<br/><br/><br/>We are grateful for all the support and are looking for your feedback on what kind of additional content (classes, spells, characters) you want us to add in the game.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:42:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb167b3cea231167cd2039d29dac2a0.jpg", "website": "http://amaterasusoftware.blogspot.hr/", "rating": 1.59, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 806, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Amaterasu Software"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Amaterasu Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
