Everyone wants creds or drugs or alcohol or fame or whatever, and most people are willing to backstab each other for it. But you- you're secure.\u00a0<em>Your\u00a0</em>friends would never betray you, and you make friends very easily, at least, with some people. The kind of people who have greasy black feathers and pick at trash dumps, or gnawing teeth and skitter under floorboards, or slimy skin and creep through the gutters. Your friends have your back. Anyone who wants to get to you will have to go through them.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-18T00:52:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/0556e4fbfaf9848839ab6eb9c2861036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ross_Hollander"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
