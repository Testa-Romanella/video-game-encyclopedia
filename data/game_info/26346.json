Move the player to the left and \n      the right, hitting the moles that appear.<br/>Nintendo first began \n      releasing the Game &amp; Watch series in 1980. This collection of games was \n      available on portable LCD devices, and each title featured a game and a \n      clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two modes of play: GAME A \n      (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced play). While some controls \n      have been changed in the DSiWare version to better suit the Nintendo DSi \n      system, the appearance of the game itself has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Time to clean up the neighborhood! Move the player to the left and the \n      right, and hit the moles that pop out of holes in the ground. Moles \n      appear from four holes in GAME A and from five holes in GAME B. The \n      moles in GAME B move faster than those in GAME A, and they also appear \n      more frequently. Earn one point for each mole hit, or receive a mistake \n      icon for each missed hit. Receive three mistake icons, and it\u2019s game \n      over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d876d59d8ce44c72a1d4bd02381dd5b9.jpg", "website": "http://www.nintendo.com/sites/dsiware/gameandwatch/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
