On further exploration, he finds\u00a0evidence of a lost civilisation far superior to our own, which used\u00a0automatons to dig deep into the Earth's core to supply the essential raw\u00a0materials for their advanced industry. After centuries of peace and\u00a0prosperity, the civilisation was torn apart by war, and lapsed into a long</p>\n<p>dark age, abandoning their industry and machines. Nobody, however,\u00a0thought to tell the mine robots to stop working, and through countless\u00a0aeons they had steadily accumulated a huge stockpile of valuable metals\u00a0and minerals, and Miner Willy realises that he now has the opportunity to\u00a0make his fortune by finding the underground store. Can YOU take the\u00a0challenge and guide Willy through the underground caverns to the \u00a0surface and riches. In order to move to the next chamber, you must\u00a0collect all the flashing keys in the room while avoiding nasties like</p>\n<p>POISONOUS PANSIES and SPIDERS and SLIME and worst of all, MANIC MINING\u00a0ROBOTS. When you have all the keys, you can enter the portal which will\u00a0now be flashing. The game ends when you have been \"got\" or fallen\u00a0heavily three times.</p>\n<p>Manic Miner was one of my all time favourite ZX Spectrum Games back in the '80s\u00a0The object of the game is simple, collect all the flashing items, find the exit and jump through it to get to the next level. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Keys are :-</p>\n<ul><li>Q, E, T, U, O, [, Cursor Left = Left</li><li>W, R, Y, I, P. ], Cursor Right \u00a0= Right</li><li>Z, X, C, V, B, N, M, Cursor Up \u00a0= Jump</li><li>ENTER = Start or Go To Main Screen</li><li>F1 (On Piano Screen) = Show how to play Manic Miner (From the Piano Title Page)</li><li>F1 (In Game) = Lose A Life, But miner Willy Solves Current Cavern\u00a0(Useful if you get stuck on a level.)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Cheat Codes (In Game) = Supported (6031769, TYPEWRITER, PPPENGUIN, 716486)</li><li>Cheat Codes = hold 8 9 0 to get extra lives</li></ul>\n<p>Cheat Codes = Press 7 and then the numbers 1 - 6 to change level, then release 7 first.</p>\n<p>\u00a0= Level 1</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 2</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 3</p>\n<p> 1 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 4</p>\n<p> 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 5</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 6</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 7</p>\n<p> 1 2 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 8</p>\n<p>  \u00a03 \u00a0 \u00a0 = Level 9</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 10</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 11</p>\n<p> 1 2 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 12</p>\n<p> 3 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 13</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 3 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 14</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 3 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 15</p>\n<p> 1 2 3 3 \u00a0 \u00a0  = Level 16</p>\n<p> 5 \u00a0  = Level 17</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 18</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 19</p>\n<p> 1 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 20</p>\n<p> 3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 21</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 22</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 23</p>\n<p> 1 2 3 \u00a0 5 \u00a0  = Level 24</p>\n<p>  \u00a03 5 \u00a0  = Level 25</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 26</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 \u00a0 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 27</p>\n<p> 1 2 \u00a0 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 28</p>\n<p> 3 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 29</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 3 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 30</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 3 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 31</p>\n<p> 1 2 3 3 5 \u00a0  = Level 32</p>\n<p>  \u00a06  = Level 33</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 34</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 35</p>\n<p> 1 2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 36</p>\n<p>  \u00a0 \u00a03 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 37</p>\n<p> 1 \u00a0 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 38</p>\n<p>  \u00a02 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 39</p>\n<p> 1 2 3 \u00a0 \u00a0 6  = Level 40</p>\n<p>ESC \u00a0 \u00a0= Boss Key</p>\n<p>ALT+F4 = Exit To Windows</p>\n<p>CMD+Q \u00a0= Quit from Mac</p>\n<p>Please Raise Bugs via the official GitHub Repo:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/muckypaws/Manic-Miner-Engine/issues</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T11:09:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5ce338d0f58850dd2fe1c21b9ecc505.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["muckypaws"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
