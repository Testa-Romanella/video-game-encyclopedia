Your only defenses are speed, cleverness, and the ability to launch deadly discs at yourself.</p>\n<p>Levels are fast (under ~60 seconds), hand-made with minor randomized bits, and ramp in difficulty.</p>\n<p>Gameplay consists of tearing around to find safety, carefully launching unsafe discs, and herding your pursuers into danger. When the room is satisfied, all that remains is  to reach the exit unharmed.</p>\n<p> Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrows move.</p>\n<p>Z summons a disc, then launches it at you. <br/></p>\n<p>R restarts the level (after you splat).</p>\n<p>P/Escape = pause/unpause. <br/></p>\n<p>SECRET HIDDEN FEATURE: If you're getting frustrated, N skips to the next level (this only works after you splat).</p>\n\n<p>Context:<br/></p>\n<p>Made in a bit under 2 weeks for the Disc Room Jam, hosted by Devolver Digital, celebrating the release of Disc Room. <br/></p>\n<p>Play other fine entries here: https://itch.io/jam/disc-room-game-jam/entries<br/></p>\n<p>Find more about Disc Room here: http://www.discroom.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Font is Liberation Sans, included with Unity, at times further tweaked via TextMeshPro's shader settings.</p>\n<p>Level transitions make use of Thomas Hourdel's Colorful FX shaders from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/colo...).</p><p>Other notes:</p>\n<p>\u00a0In order to keep the jam release lean &amp; polished &amp; ready by deadline, I ended up cutting out some neat things last-minute. I'd like to do an updated build sometime after the jam, adding the cut levels, enemies, and traps.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/722/7224d28ea8f52a39d42f7b9ac9bc07dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["wakeman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
