It's not really different to other games I've made in the past but I\u00a0like the little score based games. It was fun using my hand drawn art instead of pixel art.\u00a0My top score was 15 stars. See if you can beat it. The game is probably a little too hard.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Arrow/WASD keys to turn and move.<br/></p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>\"Zazie\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T12:46:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e65/e65608f5fd3e665abba0baf7d8ec2516.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
