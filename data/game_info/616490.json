An asteroid, just the size of a walnut, hit the ship with almost 10% of the speed of light, tearing an orifice, set with sharp metal teeth, in the silver hull. \r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The flexible substitute skin of the rocket managed to close the hole and stopped the maelstrom of space's vacuum, leaving them with the shock of their life - and a severely damaged ship drifting though the darkness, minimally manoeuvrable.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The ships reactor was leaking and the energy reserves where dwindling. Their only option was to make it to one of the solitary unknown moons revolving around the great gas giant reigning the star system they were currently travelling through.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p>The severely damaged ship managed to crawl through the atmosphere of one of the tinier moons, cut through the sky and landed on the grey rocks of this ominous celestial body. They stepped outside in search of urgently needed fuel.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0And this is where the story begins\u2026</p>\n\n<p>This is were your adventure - the Spaceman\u00a0Chronicles - start.</p>\n<p>Make your way in this Demo through the celestial canyons of a tiny moon in search for batteries to power your ship.
