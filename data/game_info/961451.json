Events can happen to you, your platform, or globally for everyone! The events can change platform sizes, make players go fast, convert your platform to wood, and much more.

Are you lucky enough to get a really rare one?<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can take control of game modes yourself and change everything to your liking! Don't like the explosive barrels? Remove them!
