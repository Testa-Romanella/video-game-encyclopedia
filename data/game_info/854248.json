YEAH YOU! The person reading this! Perhaps you have what it takes to make this buggy game playable again. I've attached a downloadable file\u00a0 if you want to give it a shot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*note: In all seriousness I ran out of time on this game jam, but there is enough to give about half an hour of frustration fun.
