It's a simple tower defense game, probably very unbalanced, with ten waves, one map, and two towers. Each round, the health of the enemies increases. I built a framework for many more features, but until further notice, development of this project will be halted, as my interests have moved. If anyone wants to, they can use my code, though it may not be the best. A link to the Github here. Keep in mind, however, that there is a lot of unused code that was going to go to allowing you to upgrade your towers outside of battle in a shop. The code is also scarcely commented, as I tried to rush development of this game, which I now know is a terrible idea.<br/></p>\n<p>Towers:</p>\n<p>Anarcho Primitivist: Cheap and low damage, has piercing shots.
