Seduce a local fisherman and steal his fish!</p>\n<p>This short work was created in one weekend for Ludum Dare #35 Game Jam.\u00a0The theme for the jam was \"Shapeshift\". It is very short, and the controls are admittedly not amazing, but game jams be game jams.</p>\n<p>The music was provided by my talented brother,\u00a0Chris Ver Voort.
