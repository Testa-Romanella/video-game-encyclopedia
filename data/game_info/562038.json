I\u00a0created a platformer with\u00a012 levels and three different playable characters. Alone they cannot get to the end, but by switching between them to utilize their unique strengths you\u00a0can complete each level and prove that they are stronger together!<br/><br/>Made in 7 days. Huge thanks to\u00a0Ren\u00a0for making the menu art and character sprites. This is my third game jam and the first one I've entered with a friend and it was great working on it together.</p>\n\n<p>Game made in Godot Engine, sound effects were made by me using BFXR, music was made by me on beepbox.co.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e2/0e24faed99e9c4b7e5cd8d245f093373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Xen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
