Though, this day doesn't really seem to be like any other day you've had. In fact, you might just be in for a day out for one of the missus' kids.\" -some lunatic trying to narrate this</em></p>\n<p>A Day out with Ube is a short point and click, interactive fiction with some sprinkles of horror, and adventure in development! This\u00a0follows the story of an unhinged clown keeping guard of one of the \"high-ranked clown's\" children as they well,\u00a0 take a venture on the outside world! It seems like any other day,\u00a0though the rest is up to you to find out what happens once they step foot out that door!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Dev's note: </strong><em>HI! Thank you so much for checking out my FIRST published game! This is not a finished game yet and I've been planning to make more mini projects in the future that contains more lore about my characters! I'm currently the only dev that makes this game (art, coding, most likely writing's pretty bad and englihs is not my first language so augaug), so any forms of feed back is appreciated!</em><br/><br/><em>Many thanks to PurplexiaSphinx, for helping me figuring out some troubles I've had while using the engine I used to make this game, and YOU for checking my game out! <strong>I will add the credits of the assets I used once this game is wrapped up</strong>, so patience is appreciated! After all, rushed games never go too well. So more will come out soon! (most likely game's screenshots once the game's fleshed out hehe)</em></p>\n<p><em>In terms of donations, I currently cannot take itch.io funds due to personal reasons.
