The theme of the jam was \"seven\", so my idea was to give the player seven minutes to power up before fighting a boss. If you die to the boss, you are sent back to the main world and will have to find your items again but your skills are still unlocked.\u00a0 There will be a warp to go straight to the boss as well!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my second completed jam, and I learned a lot about the engine as well as the gaps in my knowledge.\u00a0 I've come out of this with a whole list of things to improve on, and a better sense of the work flow needed for such projects. :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Action / Gamepad(Xbox) / Keyboard</p>\n<p>Move -&gt; Left Stick | A and D<br/>A - Jump -&gt; A | W or Space<br/>X - Attack - X | J<br/>Open Skills Menu - Select | Q or Tab<br/>Swap weapons - RB | i<br/>Super Move - B | H<br/>Bow - RT | O<br/>Interact - Y | U<br/>Pause - Start | Esc<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Check out the credits.txt for a full list of asset attributions.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b6/2b67aac36310044de487175e7f625017.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aether95"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
