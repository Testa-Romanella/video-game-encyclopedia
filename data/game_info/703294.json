A short fun experience\u00a0that is still filled to the brim with content and offers much replay value.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The story of <strong>Jaxon: Reloaded</strong> goes as follows: In the distant, dystopian, cyberpunk future, the military uses robots as soldiers and manages them through a single network. One day however, the robots go haywire due to a bug created by the <strong>AI system</strong> that manages all these robots. The robots are unleashed and start attacking everywhere. <strong>Jaxon</strong>, a mercenary who roams the city, is caught in the ensuing\u00a0chaos and decides to take matters into his own hands and solve this problem himself.<br/></p>\n<p>Collect cash by pocketing the money strewn throughout the levels and\u00a0defeating enemies. With that cash, you can buy better weapons and body enhancements for <strong>Jaxon</strong> in the <strong>Black Market</strong>.</p>\r\nP.S: If you encounter any \"bugs\", they were \"purposely\"\u00a0intentional. ;)\r\n<p>Some\u00a0<strong>\"legitimate\"</strong>\u00a0ratings from\u00a0<strong>\"legitimate\"\u00a0</strong>reviewers</p>\n<p>\"10/10, one of the best\" - IGN\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\"9/10, inspired a generation\" -\u00a0Metacritic\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\"9.5/10, truly a masterpiece\" -\u00a0Dustman</p>\n<p>Credits:<br/>Collaboration with: AnotherGuy (https://anotherguy7.itch.io/)<br/>Music by: Karl\u00a0Casey/White Bat Audio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMc641-k9B8)<br/>GitHub\u00a0Link: (https://github.com/AnotherGuy7/Jaxon-Reloaded)<br/>If you'd like to play Jaxon 1: (https://dunster.itch.io/jaxon)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:42:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db0/db03fa0e5bd9967c83bc83226989a083.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dunster"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
