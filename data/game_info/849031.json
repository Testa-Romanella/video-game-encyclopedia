Suggested emulators: Mesen / FCEUX.<br/><br/>There is also manual &amp;\u00a0full soundtrack as separate files. Music was composed by me and made\u00a0with Famitracker.\u00a0Most of the GFX has been ispired\u00a0by Midjourneybot and Dall-E 2.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\"Princess captured by frankenstein, 8 bit pixelart\" (Midjourneybot)</p>\n\n\n<p>Princess Zayla</p>\n\n<p>\"Angel pixelart\" (Dall-E 2)</p>\n\n<p>Mafaldrian, Guardian of Zerno</p>\n\n\n<p>Note: Last submission for competition is\u00a0September 16th. So there might be a slight chance that I\u00a0will update the game if someone reports there is a bug. In other aspects the game is \"ready\". I hope you'll like it as much as I liked making it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>BEWARE! There will be some twisted humor that might not be suitable for the strict minded. xD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:01:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42a/42a6806c7def4f013f128c5fab43df16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["m8si"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
