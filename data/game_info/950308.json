Everything else was hand crafted.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>It took us roughly <strong>25 hours</strong> start to finish to work on this. We started <strong>Saturday morning 10pst</strong>. This was not a great idea hahaha since we have not slept. But was def a great learning experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There will <strong>MOST </strong>certainly be <em>bugs </em>since we tried to hit that dead line and we were VERY ambitious! But we do plan to polish a little bit more after the Jam. And I hope people enjoy the experience none the less.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing\u00a0:D<br/>Kyle and AJ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T12:55:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a4f7343aa98b02b504b823110467e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Robotpencil \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0fGames\ud83c\udfae"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
