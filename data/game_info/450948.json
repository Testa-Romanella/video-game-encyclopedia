Here is a little project I worked on during a game jam on www.gamecodeur.fr. It is an update of my very first project you can find here :\u00a0https://dipsy974.itch.io/counter-clockwise. The gameplay is the same but instead of using primitives, I used some sprites and tiles. </p>\n<p>\u00a0Sprites and musics are not made by me, except a very few of them.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay : Left to Escape is a sort a puzzle game in which you control a little knight who is trapped in a dungeon. You have to get him out of here, knowing you can only press one key (SPACE) to make him turn left. Your goal is to gather the correct timing and pathing to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>As I did not include controls instructions in the game, don't forget you just have to press SPACE to start running and turn left.</strong></p>\n<p>I am looking forward to getting your feedbacks ! Thank you for reading and for playing :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T05:02:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/922/922cb1a32dda7e93b5187430a4eacbeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dipsy974"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
