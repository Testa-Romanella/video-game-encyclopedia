Little Isaac and his mother live happily in a small house on the hill. And suddenly the mother heard a voice, which told her that her son is defiled by sins and must be saved. The voice asks the woman to remove all evil from Isaac to save him. There are 12 endings in the game.</p>\n<p>By controlling Isaac or other of the six characters to choose from, the player must go through several levels of the basement, consisting of many rooms that are procedurally generated in the game, and the places are inhabited by hostile creatures with who you have to fight. Inside the rooms, the gameplay is designed as a shooter. The character can shoot to defeat his enemies with tears that he cries while avoiding collisions with them. Also, if the character loses all his health, he does not continue the game from the saved point, he dies. After that, the game starts from the beginning.</p>\n<p>The game will include all the content of the original game, as well as some innovations: a new Chapter, new characters and enemies, as well as new items and rooms.</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2014-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T11:54:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/926/926928beb8a9f9b31cf202965aa4cbbc.jpg", "website": "http://www.bindingofisaac.com", "rating": 4.33, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 131, "owned": 3966, "beaten": 621, "toplay": 127, "dropped": 395, "playing": 158}, "playtime": 31, "achievements_count": 547, "ratings_count": 1115, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1126, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "macOS", "Linux", "Nintendo Switch", "Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Nicalis", "Edmund McMillen"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Nicalis"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
