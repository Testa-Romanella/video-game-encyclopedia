There's only one level and it's very easy. Actually, we only spent a couple hours on it.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBut this isn't the point: this is a game *you* can learn from, improve, and remake!\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n</p><p>\nUse the arrow keys to move around.<br/>\r\n\tR to reset the level. M to mute the music.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>How this game was made!</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe made this Sokoban demo \r\n\tduring a livestream as a tutorial.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe're a team of 3 indies building our dream game development software<br/>\r\n\tand we think you'll like it too. It's called <strong>~* </strong><strong>Superpowers *~</strong> (woaaah!)\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tScripts are written in TypeScript. But Superpowers is much more than a code editor.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tIt's a carefully-crafted 2D+3D development environment where you can build and/or import all your assets!<br/>\r\n\tIt's simple, yet very capable.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can even work together in real-time by inviting friends on your server!\r\n\t\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>OK, where do I get Superpowers?</strong>\n</p><p>\nYou can grab it on itch.io for free!</p><p><strong>What about that Sokoban game?</strong><br/></p><p>\r\n\tIt's a very small and approachable project. Just one scene, one map, one script \r\n\twith lots of comments, and a few sounds.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDownload \r\n\tSokoban8's source project and dive in! There are many other demo projects you can learn from and lots of documentation too.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWe're a friendly community, you can \r\n\tjoin us on Skype to ask questions and chat! \u2665</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b238506547e84dba7c50c17d8e1716e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sparklin Labs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
