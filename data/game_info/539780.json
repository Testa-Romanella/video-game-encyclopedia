The theme was \"Unstable\", so we interpreted that as \"unstable\" platforms. The leafy platforms will decay if they are not in the firefly's light, except for the blue nocturnal leaves that grow in the dark.</p>\n<p>Programming, UI, and game design: Kolby\u00a0Trammell<br/>Art, animation, and music: Ezra Kiteck</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:35:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/893523e7aeb994bd934ddd8f7848fa6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EzraKiteck", "CaffeineNCode"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
