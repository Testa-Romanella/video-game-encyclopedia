You should go and give them a follow, they are going to release a full original album very soon!<br/></p>\n<p>I hope you can enjoy this little demo, I've\u00a0poured\u00a0my\u00a0heart\u00a0and\u00a0soul into\u00a0it\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a0seven\u00a0months,\u00a0so\u00a0it\u00a0would\u00a0mean\u00a0a\u00a0lot\u00a0to\u00a0me\u00a0if you\u00a0could\u00a0try\u00a0it\u00a0out\u00a0and\u00a0leave\u00a0your\u00a0feedback\u00a0about the experience in\u00a0the\u00a0feedback\u00a0thread in the community down below.</p>\n<p>Thank you and have a nice day!\r\n    </p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Explore a handcrafted world in search of a special kind of leaves in a non-linear way!\r\n</li><li>Use a wide array of available moves to overcome platforming challenges for different rewards!\r\n</li><li>Follow the story of interesting characters and help them along your way!\r\n</li><li>Find unlockable colors for your character!\r\n</li><li>Enter photo mode to take screenshots of your gameplay at almost any time!\r\n</li><li>Search every last corner of the map to find hidden secrets and easter eggs!\r\n</li><li>Enjoy the game either in english, or spanish!</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The game supports keyboard and controllers, at least the ones tested, and you can change the controls  in the options menu of the game, but in case you need them, the default  controls (assuming an x-box controller) are:\r\n    </p>\n<ul><li>WASD/D-pad - Up, left, down, right</li><li>J/A-button - Accept/Jump</li><li>K/B-Button - Cancel/Dash</li><li>L/Y-Button - Interact</li><li>I/X-Button - Pogo\r\n</li><li>U/Select-Button - Status menu</li><li>Escape/Start-Button - Pause</li><li>P/Left Trigger - Photo mode</li></ul>\r\nHardware specs.:\r\n<p>I imagine pretty much anything slightly modern or not that modern can  run it, since it's just a simple 2D game with a relatively low  resolution. But the lowest spec computer I was able to test the game in  was a thinkpad x230 and it ran smoothly, if you have one with lower specs than that and are  able to run the game, please let me know to update this information.\r\n    </p>\r\nInfo and future:\r\n<p>The demo covers the first area of the game, and the playtime will  vary depending on how much you explore or how difficult you find the  challenges, but from my experience, I think a single playthrough will  take between one and two hours.\r\n    </p>\n<p>The linux version has been tested in linux mint, I'm not  sure if it  will work in other distributions, but if it doesn't work in  yours,  please contact me and I'll see if I can fix it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0As for the future of the game, I'm planning on launching a  crowdfunding campaign around the end of february of 2023, once I've made  sure the demo is robust enough, since I wouldn't want to release it as a campaign before testing it  more and letting more people play it to see if they find anything.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to support me before the campaign goes live though, consider giving a donation when downloading the game!<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>You can also find the OST for the demo here!</strong><br/></p>\r\nDiscord:\r\n<p>If you want to keep up to date and maybe meet and talk with other people interested in the game, you can join the development discord.</p>\n<p>I'll be there and I'll answer any questions whenever possible.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T12:04:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcf/dcf300e1f0f7df0483e8884b43aeeba1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Strelly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
