Thought this would be good to practice surreal imagery in a limited engine. I'm actually happy with Bitsy, because once you know the limits you realize what ideas can and can't be done, assuming you aren't using hacks. It means I won't have to deal with unexpected coding trouble. May use it in the future if I want to make something brief.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T05:46:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/646/646b2ec5fece07ae092500807d5795b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LittleFieryOne"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
