The theme is \"Too much water\".</p>\n<p>This is both my first project uploaded to Itch.io and the first game I have ever created for a game jam. Obviously it's not fully developed as an idea and contains plenty of bugs, but I'm at least happy to have gained experience throughout it.</p>\n<p>One bug you may encounter is that Sonic will get stuck on the edge of a level tile while he is jumping. You can get out of this by moving in the other direction. I have no idea how I can fix this.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone for playing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T03:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a6/0a6048fed2242de2520d0c47b0b1e7e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VideoGameKid265"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
