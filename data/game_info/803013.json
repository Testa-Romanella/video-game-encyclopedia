The Idea is that you the player get transported into an alternate dimension filled with BUGS, which is what programmers hate most. The game also features repeating room and recurring aspects, along with other creepy elements.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n<p>E - Interact</p>\n<p>PS: the only way to exit the game is either through the main menu or ALT F4 (sorry)</p>\n<p><strong>EXTRA:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was created as part of a game jam challenge given to me by Logitech. Feel free to check out my videos with the BTS of how the game was made and to find out more about Logitech products.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also here are the videos of the other devs that also participated :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T12:40:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/6954f79cc968bbc70b43fabd57b54455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ZYGER"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
