I also considered adding a tutorial to the game, but due to real life events (holidays,) I had a more strict time schedule.</p>\n<p>I also realized that using Raycasts to handle shooting would likely have been more wise, as the MAC-10's automatic fire can be a bit... off.</p>\n<p>Another problem I noticed after compiling the game was that I did not properly scale my UI elements correctly. I hope to improve my UI in my upcoming projects.</p><p>I apologize for being unable to provide a WebGL build of the game, I was compiling the game and Unity just didn't want to output the files. I hope to resolve this problem for future game jams.</p>\n<p>That's all for now, and I hope to see all of you in the next Weekly Game Jam!\u00a0<br/>- liver man</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/329fae3c716a2777fc46c222d9691f18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["TheLiverMan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
