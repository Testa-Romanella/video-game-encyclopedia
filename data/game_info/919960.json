In this game you slowly lose sanity until you go insane and quit your job. Successfully scanning barcodes will make you regain some of your sanity.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Strength in numbers.\" so I implemented this theme literally, and if you correctly enter the numers into the pin pad, you get strength. Strength lets you regain sanity easier.</p>\n\n<p>This game was only made in 3 days as I started working on it late, I ran out of time near the end which is why its a bit rough around the edges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T06:57:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/9214ff689eefce5f0859e81fac95b9a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["BuzzDev"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
