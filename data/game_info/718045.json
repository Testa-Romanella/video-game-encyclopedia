{"id": 718045, "slug": "cut-for-a-country", "name": "Cut for a country", "name_original": "Cut for a country", "description": "<p>This is a homebrew fighting game for PS1. Currently requires two players, because I haven't made the AI yet. I also plan on making a PC/browser version after the jam. Made for the 32-bit HolidayJam 2021.<br/></p>\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>There was a ruler who declared a national holiday to make a fighting competition where whoever won would get to rule the country. He was obviously hoping to win it himself.</p>\n<p>Right now there's only one playable character. A Christmas elf/gnome called Juul.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>DPAD to move (I'll try and get the analog stick working after the jam),</li><li>Cross to punch (I'll try and add more attacks later).</li><li>Circle to dash (towards the other player, unless you're holding the opposite direction on the DPAD). </li><li>Triangle: dodge (currently doges all attacks, I'll make different doges for different attacks later.</li><li>Start: Reset after a match (does nothing during a match).</li><li>Select: Switch languages (only works when there's text on screen).</li></ul>\n<p>Known issues (jam version):</p>\n<p>- The Spanish translation showed wrong if player two wins due to using out-of-font characters. And it partially goes out of the screen: it's too far to the right. <br/>- Text didn't show correctly in DuckStation (and probably looked wrong in some other emulators and on real hardware too). This was caused by the TIM data being misaligned in RAM.</p>\n<p>- There are problems, apparently in libpsn00b's GPU-related assembly code, that can cause the game to show wrong in no$psx and possibly other emulators. This is why I ony included an NTSC build, and these problems are still present in post-jam builds.</p>\n<p>- Language switching didn't work. This was a hardcoded reference to the English text data getting to overwrite the pointers that were set when switching langauges. It should be fixed in postjam-builds.</p>\n<p>- The letter Z wouldn't have drawn correctly, as its coordinates were wrong and its width was negative. That should be fixed in 2022 builds.</p><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T06:25:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4c/d4cae579d1952ef1300c38e600bc95f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SeaLiteral"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
