The world is now a nightmare after surviving a massive nuclear fallout. The world government has implanted VR lenses into everyone at birth to keep the peace while they and the elite prepare to leave the planet.</p>\n<p>Luckily(?) for you, your lenses have malfunctioned and you see glimpses of the real world. It is up to you to stop the corrupt elite!</p>\n<p>This game was made for Brackeys 2022.1 Game Jam! It was our first game, and all of us are beginners to both coding and Unity. We had a ton of fun working together and learned a lot. To us, this\u00a0\u00a0was a total win in itself.\u00a0</p><p>If you like what you see, do leave us a rating at the Game Jam page!
