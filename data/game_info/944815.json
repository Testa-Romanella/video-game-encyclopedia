This incentivices the player to upgrade the attack stats of their pieces to have a higher chance of capturing immediately, but also to upgrade their HP stats as to deny the enemy the ability to do the same. <br/>The goal of the game is to complete each level in as few moves, using the least pieces possible. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T13:27:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eee/eee163f5280cb88a0e476da812648b4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["happy737"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
