My first 5/5 this LD.\" -\u00a0Jes\u00fas\u00a0Gonz\u00e1lez\r\n\"Great atmosphere! The music, particle effects, and fireworks explosion when killing an enemy were very well done.\" -\u00a0BoxedMeatRevolution\r\n\"Very nice game and I love how everything was tied to the theme of space nicely.\" -\u00a0John\u00a0Snyder\r\n\"The result is pretty polished and complete.\" -\u00a0Cassio\u00a0Eduardo\r\n\"I like how turning is hyper precise but forward movement is clunky, it\u2019s the right mix of fun and frustrating.\" -\u00a0jjjjason\r\n\"Busting up enemy ships feels real good.
