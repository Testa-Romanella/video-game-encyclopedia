A few years ago this went wrong when the train derailed when entering Gorleben. The radioactive waste tainted the city and many people got sick and died. The government made laws to stop all trains from entering the city. But they didn't do anything to clean up the radioactive waste and people kept on getting sick. You want to stop this so you built your own train and now you're on your way from La Hague to Gorleben to help the people and stop the government. Ofcourse the German government will make sure you get a hard time.</p>\n<p><strong>G</strong><strong>ameplay:<br/> </strong>Gorleben is a short action game where you drive a train with a machine gun through a few levels from La Hague to Gorleben. Every level has different enemies like police cars, helicopters and later on even tanks.</p>\n<p>The game can be finished in 10 minutes but at the same time it's quite difficult. So when you die you just restart the current level with full health.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/> </strong>Mouse to aim and shoot, escape to exit<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Backstory:</strong><br/>This is one of the many games I made a decade ago in Game Maker before Yoyogames took over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:08:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de3/de3f7c63b21be6c669c508344ffebb32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trevortjes"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
