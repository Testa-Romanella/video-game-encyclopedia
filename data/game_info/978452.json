With a main story that you can finish in <strong>approx. 1 hour</strong>, play as a very special colony of ants as you fight to secure the mysterious seed in each of 4 explorable areas. Try not to lose any of your Sisters in simple, yet challenging, turn-based combat against a variety of grotesque and unnerving creepy-crawlies! But even if one falls, the others must carry on and tend to both the Queen they love, and their new brood of rapidly-growing eggs~<br/><br/>After you complete the main story, you can face down all the bosses over again in the bonus Gauntlet Mode! Customize your ants for the trial with a combination of all the available upgrades and try to survive the boss gauntlet one after another. Make it to the end, and you'll earn a special reward from the Queen (in the form of some extra spicy art scenes), as well as access to the Gallery to view all the art you may have missed! It's a whole nest's worth of content in this compact world~ <br/><br/>And, new to the <strong>Final Evolution</strong> version, there's a few changes to improve the experience:<br/>- You can now play through the main story on \"Relaxed Mode\", which removes some of the obstructing enemy encounters and increases your base stats to make for an easier time!<br/>- You can choose to play the game with the original NSFW art, or with alternate, insect-only art that's safe for streaming!<br/>- A cheat code entry can be accessed before the title menu by pressing the Select button~<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>A small colony of exiled queens, living out life imitating what they knew, suddenly disrupted by an unnatural infestation...<br/><br/>\"It's like a mostly-straight-faced B-movie with sci-fi erotica vibes, but about <strong>ants</strong>!\" <br/><br/>When a crop of mysterious seed pods spread across their habitat, the ants must fight to survive against the mutated insects that now infest their gathering spaces. But, perhaps more importantly to them, they fight to secure the strange, new seeds for themselves. Seeds that change their bodies, evolving them in new ways to defeat the creatures. Seeds that, somehow, have allowed their barren Queen to start producing eggs again...<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Z / J  -  Interact / Choose (A Button)<br/><br/>X / K  -  Cancel (B Button)<br/><br/>WASD / Arrow keys  -  Movement (Directional Pad)<br/><br/>Enter  - Pause/Status (Start Button)<br/><br/>Shift  -  Select Button", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T07:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/624/624b6ee87fcdcf83c1ade12f0dc4e455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["astoryinpieces"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["astoryinpieces"], "esrb_rating": null}
