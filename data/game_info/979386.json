Will you solve the mystery of how you ended up there? And will you be able to return to your time? And maybe find love?<br/><br/>In this visual novel you will meet four extraordinary (and quirky) girls, learn more about your world and uncover the mystery. On the way, original puzzles are challenging you. Master them \u2013 or simply chicken out.<br/><br/>Dive into the story and find out how sweet science can be!<h3>Features &amp; Gameplay:</h3>The visual novel includes eight good endings and a few bad ones. Make the right decisions and master the minigames to reach the ending of your choice! The minigames feature unique, science inspired puzzles that will challenge your mind (but you can skip them if it's too hard for you). Moreover, in one of the minigames you will challenge your favorite character to a game of Go, but don't worry: Mr Young is going to explain the rules to you before the game. <br/>Sweet Science contains several interwoven story lines. To uncover them all, you will play more than one route. One route contains around 5 hours of gameplay, for all routes we estimate 15-20 hours of game play. On the way, you will encounter hundreds of graphics and a full soundtrack, featuring the song \"Butterfly Lullaby\" composed for this game by Alec Weesner, and the song \"Time\", sung by Emilia.<br/>\"Sweet Science\" is waiting for you. \u2013 Will you uncover all its secrets?<h3>Cast:</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3><br/>This is one of the first real AI-generated visual novels: nearly all artwork was generated by AI artists (NovelAI, DALL-E 2, Diffusion Bee). But is this artwork art? The story touches on this and many other questions in an entertaining and open-minded way.<h3>Steam Release Special</h3>To celebrate the Steam release, we have added one extra scene. You can access it from the main menu at \"Extra+\". It contains mild spoilers, so better watch after finishing at least the first three days of the game.
