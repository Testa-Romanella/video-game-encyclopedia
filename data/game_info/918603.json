To make matters worse, the judge agreed to have the hearing today.\u00a0<br/>She may want to divorce him, but his lawyer has devised a plan to keep her from separating him from his money (though he might take a bit of it if he can). Guide Jim through the city and collect information he can use at the hearing. You'll also want to secure as much of his money in the process, but hurry because\u00a0time is limited, and his wife has sent some unsavory people after him!</p>\n<p><strong>https://liluo.io/xxshmedium/the-uncoupling<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T11:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8a/a8a88754e502724ec1a50427411ebf56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jason00"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
