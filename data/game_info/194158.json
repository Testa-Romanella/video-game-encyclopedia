Octocat has to fix these issues with commits.</p>\n<p>The more issues he fixes the more watchers will join in to contirbute to the codebase.</p>\n<p>If Octocat fails to fix issues they keep piling up and causing the codebase to lose watchers whenever Octocat stumbles upon these issues.</p>\n<p>Periodically Octocat will have to make a public release. If successful Octocat's codebase will increase in popularity and gain lots of watchers.</p>\n<p>If failing to release, the codebase loses a part of it's watchers who decide to go and build node modules for NASA instead.</p>\n<p>Once Octocat's codebase will gain enough popularity he can retire hapily and go with his brothers to Valhalla.
