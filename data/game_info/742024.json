You inexplicably gain physics defying abilities such as a double jump and a little bit of magic. You\u00a0need to make your way back with only torchlight to guide you.</p>\n<p>In each room you need to activate the door by lighting the orb. Then you need to reach the door\u00a0before time runs out. Hit spikes or fall to your death and the level will restart. To help you make it in time, you have gained a dash ability. It has a cooldown so make sure to not waste it.</p>\n<p>Some rooms will have moving platforms. You can freeze these in place\u00a0for a few seconds to help you traverse the rooms.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<strong>PS4/PS5 Controller</strong><strong>Xbox Controller</strong><strong>PC/Keyboard</strong>MovementLeft stickLeft stickArrow keys or WASDJumpCross (X)ASpacebarInteract (only if a question mark is above your head)Circle (O)BEDashR1RQFreeze PlatformsSquareXCRestartTriangleYR\r\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Character Art -\u00a0https://pimen.itch.io/fantasy-platformer-character</p>\n<p>Tileset - https://the-baldur.itch.io/pixelart-adventure-pack</p>\n<p>Music - original song done by StoreBoughtFood\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/storeboughtfood<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T05:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12c/12c2c58e72720452f5fa1e982f1f9af7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BroReNata"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
