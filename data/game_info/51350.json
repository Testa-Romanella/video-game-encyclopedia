{"id": 51350, "slug": "scythe-digital-edition", "name": "Scythe: Digital Edition", "name_original": "Scythe: Digital Edition", "description": "<p>Scythe is a board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a fallen leader attempting to restore their honor and lead their faction to power in Eastern Europa. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.<br />\nFeatures :<br />\n-Asymmetry: Each player begins the game with different resources (strength, victory points, movement capabilities, and popularity), their choice of several faction-specific abilities, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction\u2019s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game.<br />\n-Strategy: Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player\u2019s individual hidden objective cards, the only elements of luck are encounter cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands and combat cards that give you a temporary boost in combat. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br />\n-Engaged Play: Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict, there is no player elimination, nor can units be killed or destroyed.<br />\nEngine Building: Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:45:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eed/eed5c04763919193268a78351d33ec19.jpg", "website": "http://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/scythe/", "rating": 3.47, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 20, "owned": 408, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 18, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 54, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["iOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Asmodee Digital", "The Knights of Unity"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Asmodee Digital"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
