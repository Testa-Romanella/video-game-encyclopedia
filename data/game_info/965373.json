However, our goal was to give it its own unique identity. This is our first attempt at a serious horror game, and creating it was quite a challenge, especially with our aging computers. The game features an engaging story, with plenty of jump scares and messages to convey. We wanted to bring back the classic horror game experience with a modern twist, so it won't take hours to complete. We've also added some special \"gifts\" for players in real life. I hope you enjoy playing our game and have a great time. <br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>The creator.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T04:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d40d338b08a40c73e3f6337dd0d7d6e.jpg", "website": "https://tzavis.studio", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marios Tzavaras", "Ioannis Tzavaras"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tzavis Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
