Your mind reels as your consciousness flies from your body and you find yourself in another dimension. Or are you? Either way, you're really high. Don't look down, and don't fall off!<br/><br/>Highball is a simple and fun rollerball adventure game where you roll and jump your way across different levels while trying not to fall off into the abyss. Find dimensional gates to move to new areas, dodge obstacles, explore and pickup mementos and talk with strange characters. Collect mementos to remove obstacles and open up new pathways. Collect all the mementos to get a special game ending.<br/><br/>Highball features 8 unique areas, an NPC you can talk to or knock off a cliff in each area, moving obstacles that instantly explode you on contact, and a penis tattoo. (the penis tattoo is currently only available on one NPC and not yet achievable by the player character). This game also features some ostensibly subtle, 4th wall breaking and/or sarcastic character dialogue. The players rollerball character controls very smoothly making it enjoyable navigating the different areas and exploring, while also making the game fun to speedrun. Most areas contain more than one possible paths to other areas, so if you're going for speed there are many different combinations and game paths to take to try and get a better endgame time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/133/133d909e926228aa3c05d1c716b48f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stormtide Productions"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stormtide Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
