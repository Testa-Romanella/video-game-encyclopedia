You&#39;ve recently moved to Lisbon, in Portugal, to take up a new job and start a new life. Within days of arriving, you meet an enchanting woman, Catarina, at a bar on a night out. After a few hours of connecting, you agree to meet her the next day in her favourite park. </p>\n<p>You arrive at the stunning park on a beautiful sunny day, with high hopes. Lou soon realises the atmosphere is a little off... it&#39;s not going to be an average date. </p>\n<p>Features:<br />\n- A cast of several characters<br />\n- Language confusion - Lou does not speak Portuguese.<br />\n- 20+ screens to explore<br />\n- A short, narrative experience, with puzzles as well. I think it will take between 30 minutes and an hour to complete. Maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less, depending on the player<br />\n- Twists and turns - shocking moments! (there&#39;s a horror element to the game)<br />\n- 90s style digitised graphics and animated sprites (sprites are animated more traditionally than in Mudlarks)<br />\n- 640 x 400 resolution<br />\n- Real world location to explore- Tapada das Necessidades in Lisbon, Portugal<br />\n- 2 click interface, with inventory etc</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-23T07:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6c/e6c532ce0f12b6b242a4731b465d6ae5.jpg", "website": "https://cadgames.weebly.com/", "rating": 2.9, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 323, "beaten": 27, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 30, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 31, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cloak and Dagger Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cloak and Dagger Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
