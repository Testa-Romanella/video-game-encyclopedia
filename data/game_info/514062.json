And yes it's actually very simple. Just avoid the enemies with your arrow keys until the <strong>COUNT DOWN</strong> is over. No big deal, there are only 5 levels with repeated content and linearly increasing difficulty. But oh, I wish it is that simple. Even I the creator have never finished until the last level. So please, don't really take it to the heart if it's too hard. Have fun! <br/></p>\n<p>Oh btw, see that nuke counter on the upper left? That's for whole screen wipe out <strong>EXPLOSION!</strong> But you can only use it <strong>ONCE</strong> per level. And it's only get triggered when you get hit. So basically it's your life. And also your ability. But I guess it's not really important after all. For the last time, have fun!</p>\n<p>*pro tip: Don't get too close to the edges<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Control:<br/></strong>Use arrow keys to move the ship<br/>Hold shift to slow down</p>\n<p><strong>Assets:</strong><br/>https://www.patreon.com/posts/14292162<br/>https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_downloads/0f21694d41506ca18e0a2813a4039e...<br/>https://redfoc.com/item/space-shooter-game-assets/<br/></p>\n\n<p>gitlab repository: https://gitlab.com/Apateon/another-random-space-shooter<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:00:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/386/386d1dce50a7fe45de335c869e6eb764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["4pateon"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
