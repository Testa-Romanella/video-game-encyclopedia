Car is generated from 5 random chosen parts and combined together with random paint colours, a light shifter has also been added to change the mood of the scene (please click anywhere\u00a0 after setting light slider to confirm setting, otherwise it will move with camera).\u00a0This is a work in progress for a potential future game, atm there are some issues with the model meshes but that shouldn't be too hard to fix. Vehicle creator should be added soon once I work out a few bugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>First click the game screen to make it active</p>\n<p>Press spacebar to generate a car, press spacebar again to generate another car</p>\n<p>Use arrow keys to move camera around model</p>\n<p>Numpad 1 to zoom in camera\u00a0</p>\n<p>Numpad 2 to zoom out camera</p>\n\n<p>Show me some screenshots of the cool cars you've come across.</p>\n\n<p>All assets and programming created by Adrift Dev</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T08:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5d/c5d7cedf7c040f3683606f695afe52f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adrift Dev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
