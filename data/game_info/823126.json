Press [SPACE] while playing to move to a different 'patient' with a different set of wounds, and press [ESC] at any time to return to the home menu.</p>\n<p>Thanks for downloading and taking the time to check out this little project!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T20:59:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e5/8e5d85efab7cfcc9176a68705acf90f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Borken Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
