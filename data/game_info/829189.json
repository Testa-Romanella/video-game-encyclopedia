The grid enlarges every other level, from 2\u00d72 up to 12\u00d712.<br/></p>\n<p>New emoji are continually added to the mix, and it\u2019s a scavenger hunt to find them! There\u2019s no time pressure, so take as long as you like.\r\n </p>\n<p>Each mistake\u2014re-touching a tile you\u2019ve already touched\u2014carries an increasing penalty that reduces your maximum possible score. A perfect game: touch 180 tiles\u2014only once!\u2014for 180 points.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Your skill is likely to improve rapidly with repeated plays!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing my game! If you enjoy it, consider\u00a0supporting it with a small\u00a0donation.</p>\r\nDETAILS\r\n<p>For mobile and desktop. Web browser with early-2022 emoji support required. (Developed and tested primarily for Safari.) There is no audio. Feedback and bug reports welcomed! Reach me at adamsimmersive.com.\r\n </p>\n<p>Each time you advance to a new level size, the grid draws randomly from all the tiles you have previously seen in the current game. The 3\u00d73 levels shuffle in 3 new emoji to find, the 4\u00d74 levels shuffle in 4 new emoji, etc.\r\n </p>\n<p>You play each level size twice, and the second time only draws from the tiles you saw the first time. After you play the last size (12\u00d712 with 12 new emoji) twice, the game ends with one final \u201cboss round\u201d: 12\u00d712 again, with 24 new emoji to find.\r\n </p>\n<p>Your first mistake costs you 1 point, the second costs 2 points, the third 3 points, etc.\r\n </p>\n<p>Mistakes never take away points you have already earned, but they reduce the maximum possible score. Your current score rises with your successes, while the maximum reduces with your mistakes. When the two meet, the game is over!\r\n </p>\n<p>If you play multiple games in a row, there is the added challenge of remembering which emoji you saw in the <em>current</em> game. To help with that, the tile style and color palette is randomized every time you play, then remains consistent until that game ends.\r\n </p>\n<p>You will see 180 different emoji each time you play, if you make it to the end. These are drawn randomly from a hand-selected pool of 625 emoji, which I selected to be visually distinct and memorable.\r\n </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:28:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/093/0931afda81f712ff3885fa04290d57c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adams Immersive"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
