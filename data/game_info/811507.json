There is a lot missing or things that are not yet added, but the key features like items movement and general vibes are\u00a0there. This game is only in its early alphas so its nothing big at the moment, if you have any suggestions i will be glad to read them in the description.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T11:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d14/d14829e236486ff4d1e613e4ccb5f7a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crawdad105"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
