I am new to game development and this is my first big project, Currently Im working on this tower defense game to learn and grow with, as well as get feedback from players! I am currently looking for someone to help me with the game by doing some artwork, if you are interested please shoot me an email with your details and and pricing or ideas you may have!</p>\n<p>The theme is castles and dragons which can include knights, dragons (a variety of them), wizards, castle guards, witch doctors, plague doctors, alchemists and more. All artwork in the game right now is stuff I threw together just to be able to start working on some of the basic gameplay functionalities. A lot more is going to be added as far as gameplay goes and nothing in the game right now is how it will work in the end product. Currently towers only damage and attack the enemies that match their color in order to allow me to use multple tower types to distinguish different types of enemies and attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Please spread the word about this game and share your ideas with me I want to grow and improve this game with the community! If you are interested in becoming a full blown tester please join my discord to stay updated on the latest updates and to spread feedback even faster with me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb3/eb38ca3766b3144a3f5b9a145723d915.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperDotaPlaya"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
