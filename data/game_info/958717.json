If you are on a Windows/Linux machine, I recommended to play the more immersive and pretty desktop version instead, it can be downloaded here.\r\n<p>original description:\r\n </p>\n<p>\"Marshmallow Land is an amazing retro 2D Platformer with a monochrome  art style, and 5 worlds of content. Released by IntelleCo Games, it is  the first game from corporate giant IntelleCo. Move, jump, and run to  stop the Firees from taking over Marshmallow Land! You must have  ultimate precision and a whole lot of determination to finish this  game!\"\r\n </p>\n<p>\r\nWhile digging through some old hard drives in my basement, I  found one that has a game I barely remember on it. It seems like this  game was lost to time on the internet because attempting to look up  \"Marshmallow Land\" on Google yields zero results from a company called  \"IntelleCo Games\". When I finished the first level, the game crashed.   So I decided to upload it here for you guys to enjoy and play instead.\r\n Forgive the cover art, I'm not the best artist, and as far as I know no real cover art exists.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T19:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c5/6c5c3c01af73c20eb032fef773cc1987.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["Mr Genie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
