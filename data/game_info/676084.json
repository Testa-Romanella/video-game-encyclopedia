Or more exactly a game where you are constantly under threat of being submerged by the ocean and you are fruitlessly trying to fight against it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The game has some very simplistic water simulation that gives you a fun dynamic \"opponent\" to fight against as you try and make your little simulated settlements thrive. However because of this, even though there is a HTML variant of the game I strongly recommend you download and run it on your PC.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\nObjective\r\n<p>You start with a single settlement on the map on the far right. You're objective is to make the dutch people prosper as much as possible. However the vicious ocean is slowly but surely rising to eat up all of our rightful clay.</p>\n<p>To your disposal you have Floodgates and Pumps as temporary measures. However these take manpower to continuously operate. A heavier investment is to build Dykes and reservoirs by terraforming the land, but it will stay like that permanently.</p>\n<p>The Settlements are your only source of workers so take care in protecting them! If you don't drain them too much on work force they will organically grow and eventually they will upgrade their district, expand the city or even settle a whole new settlement. You can also speed this along by directly investing into the settlement.</p>\n<p>You can also build Tulip Fields to bolster your economy but however keep in mind they require a lot of maintenance from your workers!<br/></p>\r\nCamera Movement\r\n<p>You control the camera by either using WASD, Arrow Keys or by dragging with the middle mouse button. Un-select your current tool by right-clicking.<br/></p>\n\n<p>And that's it! I hope you enjoy the game! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:42:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890522a391e225823e160cffc5dd2a1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Groogy"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
