The game is currently in beta version and only has the function of visiting the campus (you can currently see several monsters on campus)<br/>\r\nThe developer is a mathematics teacher at the HSNU. He became interested in making games because he was a student in the Department of Digital Media. He taught himself blender and unity for more than a year and spent another year building the campus scene of the high school attached.<br/>\r\nThe official version will be released before the end of the year, but because I am preparing for the Yunke Digital Media Research Institute, I am not sure when it will be completed. In addition, my own C# programming ability is relatively weak, so it will take several weeks to solve the problems encountered.<br/>\r\nIt is currently free. If we need to expand the number of people online at the same time, we will consider charging some funds to support the server.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nModeling:<br/>\r\nThe first one to model was the middle part of the country, so it was the most detailed but the technique was the roughest.<br/>\r\nEach of the following buildings takes about half a month to complete. There may be subtle differences. We will slowly correct them when we have time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPost-game update goals:<br/>\r\nThe game aims to be played for 60-90 minutes. If you reach the specified target level every 5 minutes, you will receive generous rewards.<br/>\r\nThe current attack modes may only include slashing and spells (but the attack explosion range and spell explosion range can be increased), and many other optional auxiliary skills will be added in the new year.<br/>\r\nFrom time to time, there will be monsters in the playground that exceed the player's level, and you need to cooperate to defeat them to get rewards.<br/>\r\nPlayer attacks against players are ineffective, but as you go to the basement, the further away from the ground, the lower the player's damage reduction will be. Currently, there is an independently developed parking area with ten floors underground.<br/>\r\nIn the test version, if the blood volume is 0, there will be no death and rebirth, and attacking players will be invalid.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nsponsor:<br/>\r\nIf you want to sponsor a little bit of the tuition for graduate school for the next two years and the cost of the high-speed train to Yunlin every week, there is a small QR code at the end of the left hand corner of the map that can help me.
