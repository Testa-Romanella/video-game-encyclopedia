When your character touches an enemy, combat occurs. Swords pair up with shields, and the results are determined by the color of both shield and sword. For example, a red sword beats a green shield, while a blue shield blocks blue and red swords.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If the character\u2019s shield is penetrated by the enemy attack, the player loses one life. If the enemy\u2019s shield is penetrated with the player's sword, the enemy dies and drops either their shield or their sword. If there are no winners in the combat, the player is pushed back by the enemy, but no damage occurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Points are awarded for dodging and killing enemies.<br/></p>\n<p>audio warning: you may need to turn down volume idk.</p>\n<p>Developed in Unity\u00a0<br/>Piskel (for the animations/art)<br/>Reaper DAW and Matthew Montag\u2019s NES VST (for the music/sound).</p>\n<p>I did all the code and Unity, as well as providing the screenshots and cover image<br/>ItsInTheSystem did all the art, except for the screenshots and cover image<br/>Brendan Rubel provided game ideas and the instructions<br/>Peter did the music and sound effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T05:11:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d96bad94c99d960cffe2280f3267d4e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oinkymoo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
