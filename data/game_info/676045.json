Some friends helped me brainstorm but I ended up doing most of it solo. <br/></p>\n<p>The gameplay was sort of inspired by Cuphead, I basically wanted to make a bad clipart version of it. If I had more time I would have made the different phases more intricate and have more variety of weapon drops (and probably made some actual art), but overall I think it turned out well.<br/></p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n    </p>\n<p>Music: Cxong - https://opengameart.org/content/lasso-lady-seamless-loop\r\n    </p>\n<p>Art: Clipart library\r\n    </p>\n<p>SFX: Stock sounds, Juhani Junkala - Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T11:33:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a68dfae8155450ff2acc29806e3b653.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Lychees"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
