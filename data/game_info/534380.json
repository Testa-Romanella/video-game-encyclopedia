Make the object spawning a bit sensible<br/>2. Make the player physical, so you can parkour on the world you just destroyed!<br/>3. Make some more levels, maybe expand the world<br/>4. Add objects and features depending on feedback!<br/>5. Maybe, just maybe, make a game out of this, something like angry birds or some parkour idea.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T03:26:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cd/2cdeba4a897aa52615b8ac4b5545baac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fireball24"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
