A small village carved out of the earth and built by the hands of its residents over generations. To your surprise you see a sea of flames bellowing in the night sky. Quickly, you ran towards the standing gate and could hear the cries of the people. Within the eerie glowing sky, you can see the winged Frilh flying within the night sky. As the odd Skeleton Warrior lays waste to an elderly woman attempting to flee her burning home. A sense of fear has entered your very soul. Now, you must end this night of terror once and for all, and send the Count to the innermost afterlife regions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T12:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/298/298fda670a5f1d5c4ec3f7f2c0e27d79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D.B.T."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
