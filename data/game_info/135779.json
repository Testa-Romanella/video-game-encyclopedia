It has custom levels based on the powers or game features that the player chooses at select points in the game. It is rather difficult, and not every level has been made. I hope you'll find fun in it, and I may build a more complete game out of this concept in the future.</p>\n<p>This game will only run on Windows.\u00a0Controls, credits, and basic troubleshooting in README.txt</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4fa56d6912844d627ad5fcf1658bb5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stella"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
