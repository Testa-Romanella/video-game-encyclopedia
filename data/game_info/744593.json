The world and style should have been more colorful and cheerful in the style of an Asian idol concert with glow sticks and cute dances for the Great Old One.</p>\n<p>Who wouldn't want to see Cthulu with a uWu face and cute clothes dancing and singing to a scary but exciting beat.</p>\n<p>While we loved the idea, we knew we couldn't create this concept in 48 hours. So we used a more basic system to create a basic concept with the little time we had.</p>\n<p>We hope you like the idea and the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T08:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a2b2f8ad13dd690fd9d4f3c46ef945.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emix0", "Spicy trickery"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
