Alright. Functional. </li><li><strong>Partially destructible environment!</strong> Well, there is an asteroid belt, that has a lot of physics objects and you can shoot them a bit.</li><li><strong>Customizable Ship! </strong>You can disable crucial ship systems to save a bit of power. Also, you can upgrade those systems.</li><li><strong>Open World!</strong>\r\n Yes, small, but it's still pretty open. And it's not procedurally \r\ngenerated as well, so your experience is carefully crafted by an actual \r\ngamedesigner. Well, not \"actual\", but I try my best.</li><li><strong>Sounds! </strong>Yes! </li><li><strong>Excitement!</strong> Yes!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c84/c84c487a8db17e5dadb362e1e4e3a263.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apple Dash"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
