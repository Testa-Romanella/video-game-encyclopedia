These monsters later scattered around the land.<br/>The worst of these were demon baby foxes. They did damage all around the land, tore tails of little piggies and caused the princess sleep paralysis every night. Thankfully, a hero appeared, who wielded 4 legendary armor sets. It was your great great great great great great grandfather. And oh man, was he great.<br/>He fustigated the little foxes and sent them back to the tower, trapping them forever. ...or so we thought. You see, they managed to escape and now they're terrorizing the kingdom once again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>4 mystical armor sets you can interchangeably use throughout the game.<br/></li><li>Over 10 unique locations + a detailed world map that can be used for fast travel.<br/></li><li>A not-so-typical witch!<br/></li><li>Two restless baby foxes!<br/></li><li>A lot of signs nailed to the ground!<br/></li><li>A lot of crows and seagulls!<br/></li><li>Unique bosses.<br/></li><li>Original artwork and soundtrack.<br/></li><li>Numerous social media accounts where you can follow the development.<br/></li><li>Customizable keybindings and customizable gamepad support.<br/></li><li>Speedrunners shall not be forgotten ;) The game includes extra Swift Challenges made especially for these folks.</li></ul><br/><br/>One of the main elements is the ability to change armor during the game. Each has its own type of attack and in addition to the inventory, there are two optional quick select menus for easier control.<h3>Type A</h3>One is designed to work comfortably with the gamepad.<br/><h3>Type B</h3>The second menu is designed to be straight-lined (works fine with the keyboard).<br/><br/>The game supports XBOX gamepad and generic USB gamepads (such as Logitech, etc.).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Swift challenges are one of the game elements. In these speedrun modes you have to beat the records of Swift Witch. Complete the level in the best possible time and get a reward! Swift Witch is not called Swift just for fun!<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a67/a67a51dd345b6ef3f0b86c4408ef7609.jpg", "website": "http://armortale.rpg2heaven.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RPG2 Heaven"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RPG2 Heaven"], "esrb_rating": null}
