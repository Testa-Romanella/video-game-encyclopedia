The theme\u00a0 I had was 'A single match'. I wanted to learn to use 2D lighting in Unity2D and create a basic AI. Unfortunately i never ended up making the basic AI, but I did make an interesting if not stressful expirience.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Plans for the future?\u00a0<br/>Ehhhh. Not sure. I feel like it's a good enough portfolio piece. I might make a sequel one day which has an actual full gameplay loop and has all the bugs fixed.. but.. maybe later.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T05:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299d4cd8a282f2ffa4df6fbae454b775.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pip"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
