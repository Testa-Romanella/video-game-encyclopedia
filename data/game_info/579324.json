It's just a brief setup of the story and you get to fight some enemies later. I tried to forget about this demo considering how bad it is. however, I thought it'd be interesting to see what people thought of it just out of curiosity.\u00a0 This does have licensed music in it and some sprites aren't mine and some of the writing is total dog shit.\u00a0 The good news is that the final product will look nothing like this and it possibly maybe won't suck ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sidenote: I don't know if the music is loud so be on the lookout for that.</p>\n<p>Super Ultra Mega Sidenote: There are some bugs that can mess shit up like when you die to Dan don't hit the \"Z\" key as the screen is fading or else you will get an error, and I think there are ways to go out of bounds because I didn't put collisions in certain places. Lastly, I think it takes a second for you to get into a fight with an enemy in the overworld town area. So really this game is an absolute mess.
