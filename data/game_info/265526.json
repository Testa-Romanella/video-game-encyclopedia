{"id": 265526, "slug": "central-limit-theorem", "name": "Central Limit Theorem", "name_original": "Central Limit Theorem", "description": "<p>CLT is an arcade shooter where enemies learn behaviours from those that went before \u2022 WebGL Demo \u2022 Win/Mac/Linux Versions<br/></p>\r\nWait, What Is It?\r\n<p>Central Limit Theorem is a survival shooter where you have to protect your core for as long as you can from the shapes attacking it. It's a quick, simple, stressful, high-score shooter designed to be played between other, more substantial games.<br/></p>\n<p>Each enemy starts with a unique behaviour (they can shoot, weave, or orbit) and they each leave a different coloured ink on the playfield. When another enemy crosses this ink later it will learn the behaviours of those that went before!<br/>The more ink, the more difficult the game becomes!</p>\n<p><strong>* IDGA Scotland Community Choice Award (Edinburgh Winner 2018) *</strong><br/></p>\r\nHow Do I Play It?\r\n<p><strong>[Fire]</strong> - Ctrl/Space<br/><strong>[Pause]</strong> - ESC/P (Use 'P' above as ESC does some odd things with the web player!)<br/><strong>[Rotate]</strong> - Arrow Keys/WASD<br/><br/>A tutorial will play the first time you run the game. It can be played again by shooting the 'Help' button. Shoot the 'Play' button to start a game!<br/>Protect your core for as long as you can, and aim for a high score!<br/><br/></p>\r\nWhy Should I Buy It?\r\n<p>Beyond supporting me and encouraging me to make more games, if you buy the game, you'll get a proper, customisable Unity-style executable for <strong>Windows, Mac, and Linux</strong>. This will allow you to have:<br/><br/>\u2022\u00a0 Higher resolution and different aspect ratios!<br/>\u2022\u00a0 Better anti-aliasing for smoother graphics!<br/>\u2022\u00a0 The ability to easily save a picture of any run by shooting the 'Photo' button<br/>\u2022\u00a0 A 'secret' bonus alternative game mode! (Try shooting things in the main menu)<br/>\u2022\u00a0 Probably much better performance!</p>\n<p><strong>ATTENTION</strong>: The design might cause some difficulties for any of you lovely people with colour perception issues. Please try the demo and check out the screenshots before buying to make sure you won't be disappointed! I believe the game is still playable, but it might be more difficult!</p>\n<p><strong>LINUX USERS</strong>: Linux graphics drivers and Unity don't seem to play 100% nicely together, even when using 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 or newer (the supported Linux OS from Unity). Testers reported running in fullscreen causes occasional problems, but that windowed mode runs fine. Your mileage may vary! <br/></p>\n<br/>When Was It Made?\r\n<p>I couldn't get along to the Global Game Jam 2018 (#GGJ18), but I decided to create something within the same time frame. The theme was 'transmission', so I allowed enemies to transmit their behaviours to each other via ink! Since then loads of new features and polish have been added to Cental Limit Theorem!</p>\n<p>Twitter: https://twitter.com/AmicableAnimal<br/>Website: http://www.amicableanimal.com/<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e8e901d8d3a9450f83038956e5cdc1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Amicable Animal"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
