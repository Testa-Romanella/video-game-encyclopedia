The sole survivor, Chief Scientist Archer, paints a dire picture: an experiment to fuse a human volunteer with a virtual intelligence created a dangerous hybrid &quot;VI overlord&quot;. The rampaging VI has already attacked three other Cerberus bases, controlling any technology it finds in an attempt to break free--and unleashing geth across the planet. Unless Shepard can infiltrate the VI&#39;s fortress and shut it down, this homicidal intelligence will beam itself-off planet and wreak havoc on other systems.</p>", "metacritic": 84, "released": "2010-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T18:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64c/64c94f6b185faef9fb5b042ddde0f0ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.01, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 25, "beaten": 121, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 60, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 88, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 88, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["BioWare"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
