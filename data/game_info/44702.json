Do you think hard is too casual? DO YOU LIKE HYPER? Try the HYPER MODE, finish a lab without dying in order to beat the high score!<br/>\t- Practice the labs and car handling in the PRACTICE MODE.<br/>        - We are currently working on the TIME MODE. It is much more forgiving and lets you respawn once you have died.<br/><br/><strong>Each of the modes above can be played alone or with your friends in split screen which is also being developed while this game is still in early access.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/754/754bd72abfec8db129c56ddd177de97f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["DRUNKEN APES"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DRUNKEN APES"], "esrb_rating": null}
