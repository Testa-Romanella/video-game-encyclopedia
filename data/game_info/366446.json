There's a small map to roam around in, three guards that can chase you around, and a secret way into the building. I was hoping to add voice lines for the guards so that you could hear what's going on behind you, but I didn't get around to adding any sound effects.</p>\n<p>The graphics are rendered and dithered to just three colours, which makes it kind of hard to see what's going on. If you're really having trouble, press F1 to turn off the shader.</p>\n<p>I'll follow up some time with a post jam version with sound effects and an actual level to explore. I'll bump the resolution to 128x128 too, it makes it a lot more playable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>Left click - interact</p>\n<p>Right click - flashlight</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Shift - sprint</p>\n<p>Control - crouch</p><p>F1 - toggle the shader</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming and art assets - Sean Gilhuly</p>\n<p>Music - Alex McCulloch (Jazz Take 2)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-19T04:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/000/000aef1e19cedb6f96ff02d7a026b9aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpareWizard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
