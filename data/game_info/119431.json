The plotline is that people have been falling into a coma and waking up in a magical place called DreamCatcher HQ. There is only one way out and that's to fight in a tournament for a failsafe.<br/><br/>My character Hazel is from a youtube animation I am working on tentatively called Fairy vs Mafia. In that animation she is not okay, DreamCatcherOCT seemed like a good fit for the character so I decided to enter.\u00a0\u00a0I hope to finish the animation soonish and when it is done I hope you will consider checking it out.</p>\n<p>I am not sure the game makes sense or is fun divorced from it's context but maybe you should give it a try anyway?</p>\n\n<p>What is an OCT?</p>\n<p>An Original Character Tournament is a a elaborate system of trading art where artists enter their original character into a fighting Tournament. They then get paired with another artist and both of them create separate depictions of their battle which is then decided on by judges.\u00a0<br/><br/>The entry picked by the judges becomes canon and the artist moves onto the next round until all other artists have been eliminated. This creates a story and is a great way to learn how to do art and make friends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4b/b4bafe9aa63eef91d2d0ba0cc65da9cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pc0hidq"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
