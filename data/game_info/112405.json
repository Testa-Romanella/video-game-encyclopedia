The farmers just let their cows roam so watch out on you way to the station! </p><p><strong>~Behind the Scenes~</strong><br/></p><p>I made this game as part of GDL's Jamming January Jam 2017. I was my first Game Jam and I am so excited about it. I used Piskel 2 for art and the love2d Lua framework/engine. I learned it the same time I was making this so that was fun! I'm sure you guys can find a way to break it some more. Just leave a comment here or email me at macolby42@gmail.com for bugs and suggestions! I hope you at least get a little kick out of what I have created here this weekend. Thank you for just giving it a try.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e49d32f5010b32859d1734785a27671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["manster77"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
