This was developed in just under a year of work by 5 people in their free time. As we could not find any financing, we decided to cancel the project.

These can be of different types: fight, trap, treasure and transfer.</p>\n<p>The combat system is turn-based and the moves at our disposal have a predefined number of uses before they become unusable. You don't get the moves as you level up, but you steal them from enemies after defeating them or they are given to you by NPC.</p>\n<p>It will be possible to capture most of the enemies defeated in battle that populate the game world.</p>\n\r\nInstall instructions\r\n<ul><li>Download .zip file.\r\n</li><li>Place in a folder on your desktop.\r\n</li><li>Right click -&gt; Extract Here.\r\n</li><li>Double click on \"Hubris Paradigma.exe\".\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T05:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/197/197be684b45d8113842ce93a241e1264.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Young Wave Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
