After finishing the Asteroids clone, I wanted to make a \"sister\" game of sorts, so I made a Spacewar clone! Including gravity, and a sun to crash into! No AI, so you need a second player to play this with! It took a bit of time to get the second player to work, having to convert the player into a tabled object. I hope this one works well, too!</p>\n<p>Thank you very much!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-24T09:34:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dad/dad30eb4559cf5e9815f927b9b59bce0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquasition"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
