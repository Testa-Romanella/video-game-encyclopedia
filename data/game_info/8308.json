You will then use your hard-earned unicorn tears, fairy dandruff and whatnot to craft powerful mixtures with wacky effects! May the best wizard win! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHOW TO PLAY<br/>\r\nAt the beginning of the game, each player is given potions to complete with specific effects and ingredients. You will have to select ingredients in the dispenser; once your selected ingredient is removed, the ingredients above will slide down. If two ingredients of the same nature collide, they explode and you get them too! You can then use your ingredients to cook up your potions. You only have a limited tank space to store remaining ingredients from one turn to another, so choose carefully! Once a potion is completed, you score points, get to use its powerful effect and pick another potion to craft. The wizard with the most points wins!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPREPARE FOR THE POTIONS EXAM IN SOLO<br/>\r\nPlay against up to 3 adjustable AIs to sharpen your potion crafting skills!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOR PROVE YOUR MASTERY IN MULTIPLAYER MODE!<br/>\r\nPlay against wizards from all over the world online and get to the top of the worldwide leaderboard!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo sum up, the game features include:<br/>\r\n\u2022 The magical universe of the board game, fleshed out and digitally enhanced<br/>\r\n\u2022 A tactical gameplay, allowing for different playstyles and strategies<br/>\r\n\u2022 A Solo mode against up to 3 adjustable AIs<br/>\r\n\u2022 An online Multiplayer Mode with a worldwide leaderboard", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T18:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a434df5ae5f4c5554563fd04ac7a0b45.jpeg", "website": "http://www.asmodee-digital.com/potionexplosion", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 277, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC", "macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Asmodee Digital", "Studio Clangore"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Asmodee Digital", "Horrible Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
