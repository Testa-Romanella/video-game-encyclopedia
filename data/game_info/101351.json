(And click to hit buttons, but that's made a little obvious in-game :p)</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tIn-game notes have overtones of the connections felt in relationships, treating each person as their own world, with their own perspectives and views that enable positive connections with each other.</p><p>There is one easter egg hidden in each level in the game. Can you find them all?</p><p>Matters of Perspective was made for the 48 hour Compo in the Ludum Dare 30 game jam competition. It was made in 48 hours from scratch in Unity3D. Until the competition rating period ends on the 16th of September, I won't update this game, in line with competition rules. However, I will still be working on this game during that time - you can receive updates and developments on Twitter at @llnesisll.</p><p>If you can rate my game for Ludum Dare, please do! And even if you can't, it's still great to hear any thoughts you have. You can give ratings and leave comments at http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&amp;uid=2726. Also feel free to fire comments at my Twitter.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31cb2389bdfd3c5b75545705e029bd33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nesis"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
