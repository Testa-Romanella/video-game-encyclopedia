I still haven't even bought rpg maker, I'm using\u00a0<em> RPGMAKER XP ON FREE TRIAL LMFAO</em> but yeah I want to take this seriously. I wanna remake most of this in MV, I'm learning how to do stuff in XP.<br/></p>\n<p>The main premise of the game is Lucid Dreaming. I struggle with it a lot and I meet my demons in various forms. I want to make this a puzzle-exploration boss run, basically the lovechild of Yume Nikki, Megaman and Oneshot.\u00a0 The main character [I've not decided on her name yet] suffers from lucid dreaming and often finds it hard to wake up. She needs to find some fragments of reality in her dreams that will allow her to wake up... or you can choose not to take them with you and stay asleep! Explore her rocky relationship with her body, her family, her demons and her Self.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If this gets plenty of downloads I will probably buy rpg maker MV;; $25 is a lot in my currency tho so I'm a bit skittish about that</p>\n<p>SIDE NOTE: You can push the boxes only from the right side, sorry about that;;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/357/357155568b23b6cccb662dd5abef0307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RazzyTheFan"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
