Run around as fast as you can, avoiding the metal Obstacles, Trees, and Bushes, collecting Coins before the Platform disappears!</p>\n<p>Collecting a Diamond while its Blue will slow the Platform's shrinking (that's what you want)!</p>\n<p>Collecting a Diamond while its Blue will speed up how fast the Platform shrinks (that's NOT what you want)!</p>\n<p>Be sure to collect at least 10 Coins before trying to Jump down to the second Platform or the Force Field will still be active!</p>\n<p>Everything that touches the Column in the middle is Destroyed, including you! So watch out! The Trees and Bushes both move into the Column with the Platform as well, so space and get cramped!</p>\n<p>The Player can Push Back approaching Diamonds and wait until they are the right color to pick up!</p>\n<p>The Player can also Drag the metal Obstacles out of their way if they need to during the game.</p>\n<p>WASD = How the Player moves</p>\n<p>Mouse = How the Player rotates</p>\n<p>L Click = Push Back</p>\n<p>R Click = Sprint</p>\n<p>Space = Jump</p>\n<p>C= Drag (be a little careful with this one!)</p>\n<p>Thanks for looking at it and playing! It was my first Game Jam and while I didn't finish quite by the deadline I am glad I finished something all all!!</p>\n<p>*I also left the Sphere/Line Trace in so you can see the Push Back and Drag Actions as I have yet to put an animation for them &gt;.&lt;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T03:10:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea0/ea03ad18ddc67c56409dc566c6a7e4d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["lessThanMe"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
