Great for beginners and a challenge for experts. It has beautiful graphics, smooth game play and subtle sound effects.<br/><br/>Sudoku is a number puzzle game where you try to fill in the blanks. Each digit (from 1 to 9) can only appear once in each row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. There is only one solution for each puzzle. Here's an example:<br/><br/>If a row looks like this:<br/>    1 3 _ 4 5 6 8 9 7<br/>Then the number 2 is the only possible answer for that empty space, because the numbers 13456789 are all already in that row. By looking to see which numbers are already in a row, column and 3x3 sub-grid you can figure out what numbers go in each cell. (It sounds more complicated than it is! The \"SIMPLE\" level puzzles make it pretty easy to get started.)<br/><br/>If you love puzzle and card games try my other games too!<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION <br/><br/>Eric's Sudoku has 5 difficulty levels of puzzles from SIMPLE to EXPERT.
