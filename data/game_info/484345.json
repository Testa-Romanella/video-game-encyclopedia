We took design inspiration from our homeland New Zealand, using different native birds for the different forms. We felt this would create a unique adventure-platform experience. Thus Manu was born.<br/><br/>This game is far from complete, but we were quite surprised how much the three of us we were able to create in 72 hours. There are many other features we would have like to have completed within the time limit, but will have to be added afterwards instead... actually, not even the physics works properly.<br/><br/>Great job Keith, who did 99% of the scripting by himself, and to Sean who made those brilliant sprites.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>- [left and right arrow-keys] to move<br/>- [space] to jump as kiwi<br/>- [l shift] and [z] to toggle form<br/><br/>Caution: there may be traces of gameplay within the bugs ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:28:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/deb20371a3e1c5706359d40e2b6d3f3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sean Michael", "ExpertCrayfish", "petern3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
