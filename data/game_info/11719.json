{"id": 11719, "slug": "snow", "name": "SNOW", "name_original": "SNOW", "description": "<p>According to the creators, the only game is a free simulator of an extreme sport, descending on a snowboard and skis.</p>\n<p>However, it is not completely clear in what sense this game is the only one - the only one in the genre of simulators of extreme winter sports or the only free in this genre.</p>\n<p>The game allows you to famously go through various trails for descending on snowboarding and skiing, without leaving the seat in front of the computer.</p>\n<p>The player has everything that a real snowboarder usually has - the slopes of the mountains, the full abundance of equipment, the beautiful (or not) weather and any amount of snow.</p>\n<p>Unlike the real world, in the game world you can design slopes at your own discretion.</p>\n<p>In the game there are unexpected finds, various types of competitions, including for groups of players. You can pass the tracks in different styles too.</p>\n<h3>Open world</h3>\n<p>The game world is open. This is not an analogue of the existing slope, but a huge alpine mountain created specifically for the game, Sialia. It has four slopes that you can explore, discovering towns, valleys, old ruins and much more.</p>\n<h3>Snow</h3>\n<p>The &quot;behavior&quot; of snow in the game reproduces all of its real physical characteristics on real mountain slopes. Just like in the game, the snow reacts in reality to skiing or snowboarding.<br />\nthat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:50:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b5/9b537110cf89adc338c15b0b7c2131ac.jpg", "website": "http://www.snowthegame.com", "rating": 2.58, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 1404, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 90}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 128, "suggestions_count": 310, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 128, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Poppermost Productions"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Poppermost Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
