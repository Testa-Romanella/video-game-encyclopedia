You can go to the store to buy automatic spamming software but the logic is not implemented.\u00a0 Also the task system to get experience and move up in the dark net ladder is missing.</p>\n<p>The game is mostly in Spanish with a few stuff in English.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:45:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e041a62d5040fe1c7e2436a3efc7637.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ximo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
