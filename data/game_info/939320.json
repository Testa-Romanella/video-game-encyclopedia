Bugs and performance issues might happen, and pretty much all of the textures and visual assets are placeholders!</strong></p>\r\nThrills, chills, kills!\r\n<p>Shelly is the mayor of the Animal Village, which receives a getaway package to a deserted island from Tom Nook along with other people from the village. When they arrive, however, they find out they are trapped in the island, and\u00a0Tom Nook announces a \"killing game\" where you have to kill someone and not get caught to escape.\u00a0Shelly now must find ways to escape the island, while solving murder cases and finding the culprit in each one of them\u00a0to survive. Some will kill, others be killed.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>This is an investigation visual novel, where you constantly switch between \"wandering\" (not a thing yet), investigation and dialog modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Universal controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>F1 to open NookPhone</li><li>F2 to open Transcript</li><li>Arrow keys/WASD to navigate through the NookPhone</li><li>Left click/Enter to select option</li><li>Esc to cancel</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In dialog mode:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left click or Enter to progress with the dialog</li><li>Left Ctrl, Left Shift or X\u00a0to skip</li><li>Q to hide dialog box</li></ul>\n<p><strong>In investigation mode</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Mouse to move cursor</li><li>WASD/Right click + move to move the camera</li><li>Left click to interact</li><li>Tab to OBSERVE</li></ul>\n<p>This game also supports gamepads (at least mostly, can't really check it right now because I don't have one anymore...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T17:36:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a77/a77b6dd68460c2dacfc12c881bf46f2a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["arthurgps2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
