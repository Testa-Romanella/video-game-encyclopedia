And be sure to follow JohnnyBGood on Instagram\u00a0so you can find his NEW album dropping this Friday, January 28th!</p>\n<p>Be sure to turn your sound ON!</p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>At the end of 2021 I was looking at Spotify's \"2021 Wrapped\", and apparently I\u00a0was in the top 0.1% of fans of JohnnyBGood.\u00a0His music is an awesome blend of synth, lofi, and retro beats dashed with a hint of Nintendo vibes, with a healthy dose of coffee. I\u00a0just love the whole vibe. Please go follow him and support his stuff, and check out his new album coming later this week. It is sure to be excellent!</p>\n<p>His album art is some fun pixel art of a farm. I\u00a0am on a mission in 2022 to learn to be an indie game developer,\u00a0so I\u00a0thought: how cool would it be to make the album actually playable?\u00a0A clicker game seemed like the simplest way to go, focused around the music itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is my fan tribute. I hope you like it, and I\u00a0hope you like Johnny's music!<br/></p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>All music and art\u00a0copyright JohnnyBGood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dear Johnny: if you do not approve of this game and\u00a0would prefer I\u00a0take it down, please feel free to contact me and I'll unpublish it, no questions asked.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T09:15:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6af8a302c4ae5738bd81ac010336984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pandamander"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
