F\u0131rst mutation will occur at the start, second when the first guy is defeated(or lost to) and third when the 3rd guy is defeated(or lost to).\u00a0 You start with a random stats that can be imroved with mutations. You can color your character with RGB colors. Try not to move too much in a duel, as you're also STARVING TO DEATH. Also there is no food in sight so lost food is lost. Your opponents will get more points per goal as you go on.</p>\n<p>Coding and bad art by Mrinin, Music by Chris Gruchacz, Sound Effects\u00a0by random guys on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>SC: https://soundcloud.com/chris_gruchacz<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:25:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b78c1e6cc2dea58933c8eeb928ef5a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mrinin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
