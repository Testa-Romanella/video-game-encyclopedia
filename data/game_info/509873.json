We really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>As you can experience in the game, some things doesn't look to work really nice...<br/>This is our second jam submission, we had really big ideas for the game, but the lack of experience managing the time required\u00a0to make ALL the mechanics we wanted striked on us.<br/>We have worked hard and we have dedicated many more hours to it than is healthy... but in the end, the rush and last minute nerves\u00a0did not help to solve the problems that arose.</p>\n<p>Again, thanks to all the people who play it and give us their ideas and criticisms. We really enjoyed making the game and we\u00a0will continue working to improve it after the voting period!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T07:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9db8cf142af6f24ef9920fdce5aa5ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aixana", "Diego Jar", "almonmanzano"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
