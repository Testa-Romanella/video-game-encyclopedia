Built by students within a year for the purpose of learning how to make games, collaborate as a team, and finish something enough for publication. Because of that, support and continual work on this game is limited to individual team members and their schedules as they move towards graduation. Bugs and issues with the game are welcome to be reported on, but please be aware they are the result of once-inexperienced people learning experience on the job.<br/><br/>Regardless, our team is proud of the rich game we made and we welcome any and all interest in it! We hope someday it can continue to grow into something beyond what we made as students.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T06:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3afd4e617216321ed83a445987163ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 267, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BYU Animation"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Brigham Young University", "BYU Animation"], "esrb_rating": null}
