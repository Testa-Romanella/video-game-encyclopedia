It was a long time coming, and I put A LOT into it, including:</p>\n<p>A plot that hearkens back to one of my favorite movies.</p>\n<p>Completely redone graphics, using the Pico8 color pallet and 8x8 pixel sprites.</p>\n<p>Completely redone audio. All in-game sound effects are done by me, supplemented with some public domain sounds for the cutscene. Music was made using an ai powered song-builder.</p>\n<p>New gameplay features, including an added run button and a meter that builds up and gives you more mobility. \u00a0Also made the score tick down over time to encourage speedrunning.</p>\n<p>Completely redone UI, with my own code for the menus and a HUD for the new meter system.</p>\n<p>Used the included checkpoint system to make one long level instead of 3 smaller ones. Includes an abandoned mine-looking thing, a cavern, and some forest.</p>\n<p>4 different enemies with different behaviors - 3 of them are more or less reskins of the included enemies, but I also put together a fiddler that spawns projectiles.</p>\n<p>Ditched the lives system - when you die, you can spend 3000 points to respawn, or end the game with what you have.</p>\n\n<p>... and I\u00a0think that's everything! Please enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T07:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b859cc8e150bb0ac33b07614e438ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["SockMarch"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
