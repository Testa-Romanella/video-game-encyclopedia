Now you can create by yourself your very own solar systems with awesome 3D renders and realistic gravity physics simulation. You can create very easily new asteroids, planets, stars (even black holes!) and watch them interact and orbit in real time with newtonian physics. <br/><br/>Design your own solar systems and enjoy watching them orbit, collide and smash each other in a cosmic dance in your pocket!<br/><br/>Planet Genesis 2, the ultimate universe sandbox, includes:<br/><br/>- A complete editor which features: creating asteroids, dwarf planets, rocky planets, gas planets, four different kinds of stars and black holes. Furthermore, you will get tools to build complete proto-solar systems, asteroid fields, binary star systems and many more!<br/><br/>- Awesome climate change simulation in Earth-like planets. Watch life rising and spreading through your planet!<br/><br/>- Realistic 3D graphics as you have never seen before. Watch actual Solar System planets and procedurally generated alien worlds.<br/><br/>- Simulate and explore our actual Solar System. <br/>+ Planets available: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune<br/>+ Dwarf planets available: Ceres and Pluto<br/>+ Satellites available: Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, Tethys, Titan, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus.<br/><br/>And create your own solar system with:<br/>+ Stars available: Brown Star, Red Star, Yellow Star and Blue Star <br/>+ And Black hole!<br/><br/>- Alter time rate.<br/><br/>-Visualize a 3D grid that depicts in real time the impact of the gravitational field on celestial objects in space. Watch gravitational waves!<br/><br/>-Configure the physics simulation settings to push your device to its limit until 500 simulated worlds at the same time!<br/><br/>Please, watch the presentation video and leave a comment with your suggestions!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T05:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0f/c0f5aa5024122c1604bf778946d627f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Raptor Claw"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
