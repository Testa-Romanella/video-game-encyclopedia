Apologies for the couple months since the previous update, things came up and I wasn't able to work on the game. This update is primarily fixes from the previous version. I've written a more detailed devlog post with all of the specific changes in there.</p>\n<p>I'm going to continue working on new features and improvements and hopefully release at least one new version every month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you encounter ANY problems in the game, please let me know so that I can resolve it quickly and release a fixed version.</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game!</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT'S SNOWSHIP?</strong></p>\n<p>Snowship is a colony survival and management simulation game. You are the voice in the back of the colonist's heads and you are responsible for telling them how to survive in this harsh world.</p>\n<p>Build up your colony as large as you can by supplying your colonists with safe homes, food, beds, and materials; but watch out for anything which may befall them.</p>\n<p><strong>PROCEDURAL GENERATION</strong></p>\n<p>Everything in the world, from the terrain to the colonists, is procedurally generated. This allows for interesting and unique experiences every time you start a new game.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As Snowship is in very early and heavy development, features are constantly being added and modified to make the overall experience an enjoyable mix of fun, satisfaction, and difficulty.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that the current state of the game may </em><em>cause there to be unexpected crashing, incompatibilities, and performance issues on various systems. T<em>he game is also currently missing some critical features as it is very early in development.</em></em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Camera</strong><ul><li>Pan Camera<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys</li></ul></li><li>Zoom Camera<ul><li>Scroll Wheel or +/- Keys</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time</strong><ul><li>Slow Down Time<ul><li>1</li></ul></li><li>Speed Up Time<ul><li>2</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Toggle Pause<ul><li>SPACE</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Colonist</strong><ul><li>Select Colonist<ul><li>LMB\t(Click on Colonist)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Deselect Colonist<ul><li>RMB\t(Click Anywhere)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Move Selected Colonist<ul><li>LMB\t(Click on Tile)</li></ul></li><li>Focus on/Follow Selected Colonist<ul><li>F\t(Press / Hold)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Object</strong><ul><li>Select Object<ul><li>LMB\t(Click on Object)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Deselect Object<ul><li>RMB\t(Click Anywhere)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Object Placement</strong><ul><li>Deselect Object<ul><li>RMB\t(Click Anywhere)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Rotate Selected Object<ul><li>R</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Place Single Object<ul><li>LMB\t(Click on Tile)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Place Multiple Objects<ul><li>LMB\t(Click+Drag from Tile to Tile)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Cancel Object Placement Area Selection<ul><li>RMB or ESC\u00a0(Click Anywhere)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c6/0c6b72363d42fec211dec1b27a754f32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Flizzehh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
