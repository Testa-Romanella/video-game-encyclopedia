It was ported to the Atari, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and Vector-06c. The game contained a puzzle which could be solved for a Spy's Demise T-Shirt. According to Antic magazine in June 1984, only four people had solved it.</p>\n<p>The original draft by Alan Zeldin was called Poof!, with identical game play. For marketing, it was decided to change the graphics to fit a spy theme and Mary Locke at Penguin Software created the animated spy character. The Spy's Demise title was inspired by a drink name at a spy-themed bar in Milwaukee named The Safe House.</p>\n<p>Spy's Demise was followed by a sequel, The Spy Strikes Back, written by Penguin Software founder Mark Pelczarski and Robert Hardy. Both games, along with Penguin's Thunderbombs, were later released together as Arcade Album #1 for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec2/ec2844569befd10568aa372439cd4142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Penguin Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
