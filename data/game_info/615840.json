Use your intuition to guide you to 8 trust cubes, however, you have to do so within the five-minute time limit. You will encounter false imitation cubes that look similar but rather than increasing your points it decreases them. This game emulates real-life experiences people deal with when you let others into your life. You never really know what their true intentions are, you are just supposed to trust them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T07:47:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/84e/84e43fc658382e098a24cd82b4f9c439.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["bicdion"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
