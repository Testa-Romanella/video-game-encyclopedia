Intentional bug of not losing steps when pushing against walls.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Idea: </strong>A puzzle game in which all enemies copy you. As the last ant alive you must establish your dominance in this puzzle-based mind game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme Implementation: </strong>This is implemented via art and a couple of intentional bugs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Creation</strong>: This game was created for the Wowie Jam 2020. Due to odd time zones, we started brainstorming 15 hours late. Other than that it was relatively smooth sailing.</p>\n<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>\n<p>Programmed by: Cedar Bishop and c0d3d</p>\n<p>Menus by: c0d3d</p>\n<p>Art by: BricksParts</p>\n<p>Sound by: Lecricraft</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/460ec7256d94fc82eec42d21fa78b3d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["c0d3d", "CedarBishop", "BricksParts"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
