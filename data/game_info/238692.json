This comic is an attempt at talking about my body image issues mostly to myself and for myself, but please feel free to have a read! This only speaks to\u00a0my personal experience as a cis\u00a0queer man of colour without body or gender dysphoria.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Run best when downloaded, and it's free! Donations are enabled because rent still needs to be paid but please, no pressure at all :)<br/></p>\n<p>-=-</p>\n<p>The morning after I finished drafting this comic, I looked into the mirror and felt this strange pride.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a comic artist, I LOVE characters with distinct physical traits and features. Never flaws, just parts of the characters that make them unique and recognizable.\u00a0After drawing my \u201cflawed\u201d body for 60+ times, every thing that looked \"wrong\" became endearing.</p>\n<p>Like, those parts made me recognizable to me (and I\u2019ve had problems of not recognizing myself before) and allowing myself to say nice things about my body to me was\u2026 really nice!</p>\n<p>Anyway, my swim shorts (that look exactly like they do in the comic) just arrived and I\u2019m gonna go swimming for real\u00a0 soon. I\u2019m very excited!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading! I hope you enjoyed it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed8/ed8e3f530fb5bb144788d0ecf14d5da6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hien Pham"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
