Arrow keys and '[',']' (or '0','.') for the east coast. The two buttons are confirm and cancel.<br/></p><p>I made a co-op FF style battle with the Giant Bomb crew. You battle a monster simultaneously with another group. It's west coast versus east coast. The group who deals the most damage wins. It is a best of three rounds.</p><p>I spent 2 days learning Unity3D, a couple of days drawing the art after work and 1.5 days programming it. The controls are fixed and can't be changed. I didn't have time to learn to get inputs from a controller. I spent an additional week adding features.<br/></p><p>I included builds for Windows and Mac. I hope you all enjoy playing it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1b/f1b629a0e36a70b9f5c511815f4d9299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Larry Li"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
