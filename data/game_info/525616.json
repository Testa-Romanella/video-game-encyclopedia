I'm far too young.<br/><br/>Cassettes? Erm\u2026 it's like a hard drive but a slower, bulkier, less convenient way of storing your games to play later. But it's fun, you see, because it's retro and physical and it makes satisfying noises when you press the buttons.<br/><br/>Anyway, Awesome Mix Tape is a compilation of single mechanic games. Some might be fun, some might be challenging, some might be interesting prototypes for larger games. 6 games are included for this initial release but more will be regularly added in the future.
