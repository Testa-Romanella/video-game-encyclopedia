Will she succeed... or will all her efforts be in vain?<h3>Gameplay:</h3>Each day you must choose from a growing list of activities for Mia to complete. Each activity has it's own <strong>Hunger</strong>, <strong>Energy</strong>, and <strong>Time</strong> cost. By completing the activity, Mia will get a boost to her <strong>Mood</strong>, <strong>Motivation</strong>, and <strong>Loneliness</strong> meters. In order to progress, you must reach a threshold for these meters by a certain date (look at the achievement list for a hint).<br/><br/>There are also three additional meters which become available to the player. These correspond with Mia's <strong>Cleanliness</strong>, <strong>Room Cleanliness</strong>, and overall stress (<strong>Overwhelmed</strong>). Complete the appropriate activities to reset these meters so that Mia doesn't receive a penalty when completing other activities.<br/><br/>To complete an activity, you will be presented with a screen where Mia will be attacked by a number of bubbles (representing certain negative emotions). Simply click on these bubbles in the appropriate manner before they can reach Mia.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li>Decide on how Mia will spend her days; be sure to manage her needs and emotions!<br/></li><li>Eliminate her negative feelings in a fast-paced, shooter-style minigame that gets progressively more difficult.<br/></li><li>Uncover the events that led up to Mia's predicament as you progress through the story.<br/></li><li>Presented using hand-painted pixel art and animations.<br/></li><li>Original soundtrack made with love.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-13T03:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80e/80e678f85b7e097b116b5c4f0391e771.jpg", "website": "https://coffeesnail.co.uk/unavailed", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoffeeSnail"], "genres": ["RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CoffeeSnail"], "esrb_rating": null}
