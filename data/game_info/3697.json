But this one has a full set of everything that can be called hardcore and brutality. From the athletic figure and the hoarse voice to short phrases that leave no doubt in the victory. He goes to the past, for it can return everything as it was.<br />\nThis type of hero sets everything else, the plot is clear and straightforward - run and shoot. It happens on twelve levels, the landscapes of which are created by Nature for bloody and dynamic battles. Everyone who likes to shoot and run will be happy with everything in this game. The best in the genre is collected in one place and cleaned to chemical purity. Even the monsters you meet as old friends - and they also try for you with all their might. They roar, beat and shoot, covering the sky.<br />\nThere are enough weapons in the game, including hand-to-hand combat skills. Separate pleasure - if you kill monsters by your hands, you need to find your own approach to each. One monster needs to be pulled out of the eye, the other will die only if you wrest the heart. The heart, by the way, can then be thrown in someone - it can kill. There are a lot of pleasant surprises of this kind in the game.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2011-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T07:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/12e/12ea6b35b65df38258e25885a0a392a6.jpg", "website": "http://www.croteam.com", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 188, "owned": 4049, "beaten": 534, "toplay": 40, "dropped": 271, "playing": 11}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 125, "ratings_count": 748, "suggestions_count": 557, "game_series_count": 20, "reviews_count": 755, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Croteam"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Mastertronic Group"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
