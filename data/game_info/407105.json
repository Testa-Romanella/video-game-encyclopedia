I chose to combine the skills I'd learned in class with a tool I was trying to learn on the side, a narrative language called Ink. This project was mostly me trying to learn both Unity and Ink at once, trying things until my vision came together. What I ended up with was an interactive world where the user's movements and choices impact the story. The story itself isn't too complex-- I admit, it's not the most thrilling conversation, but I hope to combine what I learned here with some real writing in the future. (And yeah, I got an A ;) )</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy\u00a0<em>C o n v e r s a t i o n\u00a0 C u b e,\u00a0</em>an interactive conversational agent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls: Use WASD or arrow keys to move, mouse to select dialogue options.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/110/110e1efb3c07c66529001c2b8d65a065.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bewildered"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
