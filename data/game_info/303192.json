I love how calm and chill their attitude can be even when their destroying someone's live. I brought that attitude with my characters to resemble certain adventure movies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only disappointing thing was the main character inability to talk to others. I wanted to do something dark, something that I'm really not used to. I wanted to change my style for once so that's why I chose to send my character to hell. I'm proud of the fact that I actually created a game. It might not be the most visually appealing but that takes practice. Not many of my friends can say they made a game before.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T02:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2d516a3b90c46e741d3a5a3665d62c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["APegues"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
