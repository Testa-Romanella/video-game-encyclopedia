Nobody else has survived the crash and she must make her way through the several islands that make up this compound in order to find a way to communicate with someone that can help her. The government wants to deny the knowledge of this operation, so she knows nobody is coming to look for her. The player must explore the island and will find different clues leading them to a next challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>MOVEMENT:</strong> The player can use the W-A-S-D keys to move the character around the game.
