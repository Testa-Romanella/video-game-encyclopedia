The dream would basically go as follows:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>My mother is alive again, but she's as ill as she was right before her passing. In the dream, I'm aware that she had been dead and that I had finally \"adjusted\" to life without her. But now that she's back - and as sick as before - I feel an awful mixture of emotions. Besides the expected hurt and confusion, I feel resentment towards her for returning in this state,\u00a0and I feel compelled\u00a0to run away from\u00a0the same pain I felt seeing her like that the first time. And then I feel immense guilt over having those thoughts in the first place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But eventually, in the dream I start remembering everything I love about her - the comfort, warmth, protection. It all comes back to me.\u00a0Then, as soon as I \"get used to\" her presence again, and accept that she's alive once more - I wake up.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T03:59:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c0/9c0d1f6c804fb8020e06434b28703566.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ChlosMinded"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
