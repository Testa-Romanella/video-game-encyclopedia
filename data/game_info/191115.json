The Dash can be used not only to kill enemies, but\u00a0<br/>also to position yourself above them for a Fastfall kill. Killing enemies not only<br/>gives you points but also refreshes your abilities so you can keep killing and\u00a0<br/>increase your combo. Killing also increase the speed of the game, making it more\u00a0<br/>difficult. Comboing enemies increase your score and the amount of points you make\u00a0<br/>for each kill but also heal you, incntivating you to go for those big combos, specially\u00a0<br/>when low on health.\u00a0<br/>Getting hit also has two purposes: it makes you more careful by bringing you close\u00a0<br/>to the end but it also slows the game down, so you can have more time to think.\u00a0<br/>Those are just a few of the examples, but with a careful look, you can see that\u00a0<br/>everything in the game has more than one purpose.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Platforms</p>\n<p>Meant to run on Windows</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Third party resources</p>\n<p>Game engine: Unity3D v5.6.2f1 Personal (64bit)<br/>Sound effect creation: Bfxr and Audacity</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Murilo \"Mickey\" Bernard Theodoro \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Design, Coding<br/>William \"VVilliam\" Quelho Ferreira \u00a0 \u00a0Design, Sound, Coding</p>\n<p>And a special thanks to all the people who have contributed to the tools above.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19adc69116b9b2dd6014c865d118e7c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mbtheodoro"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
