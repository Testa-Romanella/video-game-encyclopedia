Control Mina Mori as you navigate a dreamscape full of distressing personal memories and other experiences that push Mina beyond the veil...</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>PHOTOSENSITIVITY WARNING. </strong>There are some areas with flickering lights and some flashing. Nothing too intense, but I feel like I'm not the best judge of that? So be careful with this game if you have issues with flashing lights.<br/></p>\n\r\nPremise\r\n<p>Mina Mori is no stranger to hardships. Until she met Aurelius Thele, her life had been a catalogue of traumas.</p>\n<p>Things seemed to be going fine. The two were creative equals. They even talked about moving in together.</p>\n<p>But then Mina learned about the cult. And not long after, Thele and the rest of the cult's inner circle performed mass suicide.</p>\n<p>Once again, Mina was alone. After the funeral, she locked herself in her apartment, doing nothing but drinking, listening to music, and reading collections of Thele's poetry. Each poem was stranger than the last, and before long she became haunted by an unusual, recurring refrain:</p>\n<p><em>Wae nihxsis prissit.</em></p>\n<p>Now she dreams of strange places. Her memories blur. How long has she locked herself in that apartment?\u00a0Long enough to drink all the alcohol, at least.<br/></p>\n<p>She awakens to a knock at her door...</p>\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>8 hub worlds to explore.</li><li>+25 unique environments, and nearly 80 rooms in total!</li><li>9 Effects (in the Yume Nikki tradition)</li><li>7 collectible pieces of music which Mina can play on her laptop.</li><li>Original pixel art, music, and sound design by Christopher Risewick (Reprobus).</li></ul>\n\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys - move</li><li>Space Bar or Enter - interact</li><li>1 - use an equipped effect (while dreaming)</li><li>9 - wake up (while dreaming)</li></ul>\n\r\nRelease History\r\n<ul><li>Demo v1.0 (Jam Edition) - The first release, launched in time for the Dream Diary 4 game jam.
