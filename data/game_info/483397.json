You can do this by either using an Ace wich destroys the armor\u00a0directly or by using 4 or more cards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I hope you have fun with his Game.</strong></p>\n<p>This was my first ever GameJam and I had a blast I now that the game is lacking in some places and there may or may not be alot of Bugs (if you find some please let me know). At this point in time I do not know if I keep working on the game. I think that is dependent on the feedback I get and how much fun I have rewriting JamedCode ;)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for taking the time and Playing the Game :)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T04:07:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a663421a67f1272b6064c1e103b1299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arghbelastend"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
