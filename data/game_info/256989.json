Use WASD controlls to navigate between separate idea platforms to outrun the deadline constantly following you. The only way to beat the level is reach the breakthrough! Restarting the level maintains your score and the more times you complete the level, the higher your score will be. A last minute issue with the licensing of the music has made this a silent game. Thank you for trying this out, this is in no way a complete game and is barely held together as is!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fcd02fa5801cc4210996590db01813a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thepankey"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
