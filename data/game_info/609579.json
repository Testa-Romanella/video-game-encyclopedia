Theme: 're-use' - re-use the destroyed enemies as bullet shields!\r\nControls: use mouse curser to direct your ship. Right mouse button to thrust, left mouse button to fire lasers. First level is a practice level (static enemies) so take time to get used to the controls.\u00a0\r\nDifficulty note: the game gets quite hard if you tech into bullets too early!\u00a0\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Sound effects: Viktor.Hahn@web.de, Kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Music: FoxSynergy</p>\n<p>Background Nebula:\u00a0www.GodsAndIdols.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T08:44:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6adba3621b0dfbdab2e907b045116785.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["v_da5id"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
