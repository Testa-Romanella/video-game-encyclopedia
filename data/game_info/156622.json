It's sort of complete and doesn't really work in multiple resolutions that well (recommend 800x600 or 1024x768 windowed) but I figured I would make it available anyways.</p>\n<p>You can play against the computer or with two people on one keyboard. The goal is to win 5 rounds by using the power-ups that appear at random. When a power-up appears, hit it with the ball to get it. To use it, press the key that appears under the power-up to queue activation next time the ball hit your paddle. Each player can only have three power-up's at a time.</p>\r\nPlayer One Controls\r\n<ul><li>Move Paddle Up: W</li><li>Move Paddle Down: S</li><li>Activate PowerUp One: 1</li><li>Activate PowerUp Two: 2</li><li>Activate PowerUp Three: 3</li></ul>\r\nPlayer Two Controls\r\n<ul><li>Move Paddle Up: Up Arrow</li><li>Move Paddle Down: Down Arrow</li><li>Activate PowerUp One: 7</li><li>Activate PowerUp Two: 8</li><li>Activate PowerUp Three: 9</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/60a/60a23a034e78205d407ea81cb1410120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Pixelshot Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
