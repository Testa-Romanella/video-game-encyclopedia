Your leader/boss, Duke Vincent, has left on business, leaving its fate in your hands.... and also the hands of Scotty from Marketing. Nobody likes Scotty Angelo, who has been trying to take over/take out the Water Park for years. You have exactly one and a half months to stop Scotty from being evil or whatever, and to prove that Friendswood shouldn't be retired from Vienna Gardens. They'll probably replace it with some sort of weird movie tie-in that really doesn't make any sense within the Friendswood area theme. <br/><br/>Over the course of the game, make sure your fellow workers gain the right skills needed in order to work together and deal with whatever issues the park throws at them. Go out for coffee, learn their interests, and maybe make lasting friendships.<h3>Australian Bushfire Organizations</h3><strong>50% of all sales go towards organizations involved in maintaining Australia's bush.</strong><br/>- South Australian County Fire Service<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> Manage your team</li></ul><ul><li> Based on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure</li></ul><ul><li> Navigate through multiple conversations in order to learn the most about your fellow employees</li></ul><ul><li> People's skillsets will affect their endings</li></ul><h3>Mature Content</h3>- Sexual innuendo<br/>- Drug humor and references", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T05:51:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a4f3173227322fdb79662e23ad04743.jpg", "website": "http://stegalosaurus.org", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development", "Steg Game Dev"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stegalosaurus Game Development"], "esrb_rating": null}
