With this idea in mind we created Big Guy, Lil Guy. In our game you play as two characters that you can change between smoothly, Big Guy and Lil Guy. Big Guy can jump far and run fast but he can\u2019t reach into the small gaps that Lil Guy can. These two need to work together to escape the lab where they have been experimented on. Take control of the two characters and help them to escape but beware of lasers, spikes and crushing objects! Make sure to use your teamwork to escape safely. We created this game because we believe that one of the most diverse things about humans is our bodies! We come in all shapes, sizes and colours each with our own experiences and struggles. We wanted people to know that just because they aren\u2019t the tallest, strongest or best looking it doesn\u2019t mean they are worthless. Hopefully people can play this game, have fun, forget about their worries and be proud of who they are.<br/>#raisethegamejam<br/>Credits:<br/>Juliano- Team Leader/Programmer<br/>Abu Bakr- Co-Leader/Programmer/QA Tester<br/>Wafi- Lead Artist<br/>Rovee- Programmer/Animation</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<strong>www.bensound.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T03:21:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ace/acee9a0891d6012b19c3299f298708c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamWorldStar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
