(Oculus - VR Game)", "description": "--- About ---\r\n<p>Created for our end of year <strong>Game Design\u00a0project</strong> during our\u00a0<strong>2nd year in TUD</strong>,\u00a0we were tasked with with development of a <strong>systemic game</strong> with a theme of \"<strong>Unwinnable War</strong>\".\u00a0 During this time I suggested to go big and different, to create a game in a <strong>3D VR environment</strong> instead of our usual 2D games we are so used to creating. Going for a <strong>educational/puzzle</strong> route we ended up picking the<strong> periodic table</strong> as our source of inspiration.\u00a0The progression of the game is tied to the use of available <strong>elemental cubes</strong> (based off the periodic table), <strong>objects</strong>, and items within the <strong>crafting table</strong>. To unlock the ability to spawn new elemental cubes, you must create a certain element to counter, or destroy the barrier blocking a spawn button. With the button now available to use, the crafting system will now have new elements and objects available to create for you, allowing for further experimentation and application to counter obstacles and puzzles.</p>\n\n<strong>This VR game has only been tested on Oculus Devices and is not guaranteed to run on any other headset!</strong>\n\r\n--- Story ---\r\n<p>\u00a0Waking up in a mysterious place, surrounded by various science equipment and a group of scientist hiding behind a thick glazed window critiquing your every move, you must complete a series of puzzles to appease the scientists or figure out an alternate way out. With elements from the periodic table by your side, you must use your skills and knowledge to bypass the elements that are thrown in your way in the form of a mysterious floating sphere. Unlocking more elements as you progress and filling in your arm database, so you don\u2019t forget how to craft a specific element.\r\n</p>\r\n--- Key Features ---\r\n<ul><li><strong>INTERACT</strong> with multiple objects in a 3D VR environment!<br/>\n</li><li><strong>CRAFT</strong>, combine and experiment with multiple unique elements and items!\r\n  </li><li><strong>RECORD</strong> recipes with your handy wrist-mounted recipe book!\r\n  </li><li><strong>FORCE      PULL</strong> objects to you with your force-grab      powers!\r\n  </li><li><strong>LEARN      </strong>a variety of different scientific elements      using the periodic table!\r\n </li></ul>\n\r\n--- Controls ---\r\n<p>The controls are based off <strong>VR hand movement</strong> and a <strong>stationary XR rig</strong>. You move your hand and interact with the <strong>grip buttons</strong> to grab and pick up items. The game features a \u201c<strong>force-grab</strong>\u201d system that allows you to grab items that are far away by holding the <strong>trigger buttons</strong>, creating a ray-cast that interacts with grabbable objects and brings them into your hands.</p>\n<p>You must place your in-game hand onto a button to active it and spawn an element.</p>\n<p>You may also open doors by pressing the <strong>grip button</strong> and <strong>grabbing handles</strong>.</p>\n<p>You are also equipped with a <strong>mechanical left arm</strong> that can <strong>display crafting recipes</strong> by holding down the \u201c<strong>Y</strong>\u201d <strong>button</strong>.\r\n</p>\n\r\n--- Credits ---\r\n\n<p><strong>Aaron   Heraghty:</strong></p> <p><strong>Lead Designer</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Programmer</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Evan Rawl:</strong></p> <p><strong>Narrative   Designer</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Game Designer</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Hang Thai:</strong></p> <p><strong>3D Modeler</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>UI Designer</strong>\n</p> \r\n--- Evan Rawl's Itch Page ---<br/>--- Hang Thai's Itch Page ---\r\n\r\n--- Appendix ---\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nAmbient Music - Freesound : Ambiance\r\n<br/>Sound Effects - Zapsplat Sounds\r\n<br/>Font -\u00a0DaFont : Back To 1982<br/>Oculus Integration - Unity Asset Store : Oculus Integration", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T09:13:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df3356171c7a1bd7ed84a69a7c40ecb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["HairyTea"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
