He falls in love with <br/>this person's apartment, due to the elegant rooms, but also the antique <br/>furniture and - last but not least - the paintings his host has created <br/>(they are macabre).<br/>While your character would like to just stick <br/>around and move from room to room, he is also a bit alarmed, because... <br/>his host has left him, without saying why; he just noted that he has <br/>something to do, and will return soon.<br/>You wonder if the other person<br/> has gotten involved into some bizarre story, or strange interests. <br/>Nevertheless... you are happy to be given the opportunity to explore the<br/> apartment on your own.</p>\n\n<p>Created with AGS, gfx modelled with Blender.<br/></p>\n<p>The Chrysalis is a free horror adventure game, and is my first creation. Special thanks to Krzysztof Gorzkowski for the music! I hope you can have fun with the game... -K.CH<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/adac005c07a9b7a691a8e1dfb856276a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KyriakosCH"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
