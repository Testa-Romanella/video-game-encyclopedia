You can play even if you don't know any programming language, the game has detailed explanations about how the language works.This game can be used as an initial stage in learning programming, so here you will not only enjoy solving puzzles, but also learn something new!</p>\n<p>P.S.\u00a0Everything related to copyright can be found in CodeGame\\CodeGame_Data\\StreamingAssets\\Copyright</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T06:33:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3b918f259e675ec6d9fc53d71773461.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UNICODE_"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
