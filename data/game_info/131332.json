For Fatima, it's looking like community service. There are rocks in the beautiful ice rings of Ingelon, and the only way to get your ride out of impound is to clear them out! So Grab your hip-jets and you Sirrus-Star multi-mode energy pistol, and get ready to rid the rings of 'roids!<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Fatima is a Shoot 'em Up where the goal is to destroy as many asteroids as possible! Each level has a minimum goal to achieve. \u00a0Fatima is protected by her personal force bubble and cannot be harmed by the asteroids, so your only concern is destroying as many as possible!\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of each level you are awarded a grade, and after 4 levels you receive a final grade. \u00a0Don't forget to take a screenshot with the Q key and share your high scores with me on Twitter! @PrismaSlice</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<ul><li><em>Movement</em> | WASD</li><li><em>Aim</em> | Mouse</li><li><em>Left Mouse</em> | Wave Beam</li><li><em>Right Mouse</em> | Shock Cannon</li><li><em>Q Key</em> | Take Screenshot</li><li><em>ESC Key </em>| Reset Demo / Quit Game at Title Screen</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controller Mode </strong></p>\n<p>Press the A Button on your XBOX controller to activate Controller Mode</p>\n<ul><li><em>Movement </em>| Left Stick</li><li><em>Aim</em> | Right Stick</li><li><em>Left Trigger</em> | Shock Cannon</li><li><em>Right Trigger</em> | Wave Beam</li></ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong> Design - Art - Code</strong></p>\n<p>Wesley P Eldridge | @PrismaSlice</p>\n<p><strong>SFX</strong></p>\n<p>Joshua Du Chene |\u00a0@JoshuaDuChene</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p>TheFatRat - Fly Away feat.
