Is there any way to restore it?<br />\nAnswer: When saved games can\u2019t be automatically restored, we\u2019ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter \u201eCatanWarp<em>\u201c (</em> = 1\u201315) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1\u201315). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well.<br />\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random?<br />\nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We\u2019re avid Catan players ourselves. We\u2019ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Questions or suggestions for improvements:<br />\nMail to ios@usm.de<br />\nWe are looking forward to your feedback!<br />\nPlease do not ask your questions in the reviews as we do not have the possibility to respond to you there.<br />\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com<br />\nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News</p>\n<hr />", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-19T18:13:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5da/5da911e933b483739fc4b4aff85cf2be.jpg", "website": "http://www.usmgames.com/content-100-100/apps/", "rating": 3.36, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 106, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 2", "PlayStation 3", "Nintendo Switch", "Android", "Xbox 360", "iOS"], "developers": ["USM", "exozet"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Asmodee Digital", "United Soft Media Verlag"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
