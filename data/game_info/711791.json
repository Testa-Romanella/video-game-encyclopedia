The more the better! You get a small multiplier based on how many of the same color/shape you can encapsulate without getting any gems of a different color/shape.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>50 points per gem of the gem type with the\u00a0HIGHEST encapsulated count</li><li><em><strong>(HIGHEST encapsulated\u00a0count/2)</strong></em><em><strong>x</strong></em> multiplier IF there isn't a mixture in gem types</li></ul>\n<p>There's a score, but there is no opposing force (time limit,\u00a0lose condition, etc.)\u00a0Go on forever, it's really just a laid back kind of game.</p>\n\n<p>Game created using Unity.</p>\n<p>Tweens were made using\u00a0Demigiant's Tweening library <em>DoTween</em>. I would recommend it!</p>\n<p>Gem shapes were created in Blender using a primative Torus with some small edits (changed major/minor segments at creation and added some edges on some)</p>\n<p>Popping sounds were recorded by me!</p>\n<p>The sad excuse for music was made using Bosca Ceoil.
