They are very selective on who they decide to invite to their team. But nonetheless, you got the email, you got the job, and now all you have to do is impress the boss. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nExcept the boss is nowhere to be found. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnd you are trapped inside. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSomebody seems to be playing a very elaborate prank on you and the other new hires or something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. It is up to you to get out safely and to figure out what is going on inside that building. I hope you're up for the task because one thing is clear, you're going to be here for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEscape the Office is a single and multiplayer experience where you and your friends will find yourselves trying to get out of several daunting situations. The initial Early Access version of the game will come with 2 levels of varying difficulty and content. The future updates of Escape the Office will give you several escape room situations that are very unlike the others. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can play with up to four friends in this quasi escape/horror room experience. Can you escape all of the rooms and prove to Permtech that you deserve to be amongst the best?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T02:31:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f01/f0123efc4659a71368df8288c4e60c42_76NhjqR.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Zhiqiang Huang", "Brothers Grimm Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Zhiqiang Huang", "Brothers Grimm Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
