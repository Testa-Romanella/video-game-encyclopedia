The theme was about making a game of a certain genre but removing a common mechanic of this genre. We\u00a0 came with a Card Game without Deck.</p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun doing this, but it turns out we didn't manage to finish what we wanted to do at the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play :</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fight enemies by playing cards from your hands. Each time you play a card, the enemy acts and you swap to the next hand. Be careful - if you run out of cards in any hand, you'll lose! The only way to replenish cards is by getting them as loot from enemies - you don't have a deck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits :\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anton Kolesnikov aka JackR1p, <em>Russia </em>: <strong>Writing, Game Design</strong></p>\n<p>Ilya Semyonov aka Urist McDorf, <em>Russia </em>: <strong>Programming, Game Design</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Benoit Deneaux aka MiracL,\u00a0\u00a0<em>France</em> : <strong>Programming</strong></p><p>Ashwalker: <strong>Programming</strong></p><p>SpoilThatSong : <strong>Sound Design, Composer</strong></p><p>Arthur : <strong>Art</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daecac83c7df607493a00ca40950d06d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sticks & Stones Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
