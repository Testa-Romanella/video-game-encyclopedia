Don&#39;t be fooled by simple graphics \u2013 you&#39;ll find a challenge for both fans of classic role-playing games and TBS strategies.<br />\n&gt;&gt; Exploration<br />\nExplore the map of The Everwoods. The mountains are rich in gold and sapphires. Fertile fields provide grasses and food. Dense forests are ripe with wood and precious acorns. Scorching deserts are rich in valuable sand. Everywhere there are secrets to attract an experienced adventurer...<br />\n&gt;&gt; City-builder<br />\nRestore an abandoned town \u2013 the ruins of an ancient civilization. This may not be as big as in classic turn-based strategy and role-playing games, but it\u2019s perfect for unhurried gameplay on the touchscreen :)<br />\n&gt;&gt; Battle<br />\nThe local inhabitants you&#39;ll encounter are not happy with their new neighbors. To battle them, you will need weapons and magic potions. You will need to craft these in the workshop according to ancient recipes.<br />\n&gt;&gt; Craft<br />\nImprovise to make your first simple tools, then progress to crafting more complex tools to ensure your survival in the wilds of The Everwoods.<br />\n&gt;&gt; Turn based tactics<br />\nThe game will become progressively more difficult \u2013 you will face new enemies, while the old ones remain familiar and safe. As in any RPG strategies, you&#39;ll level up your griblers through building the town. As they level up, your griblers gain new skills and improve their strengths.

But not everyone has this much luck...<br />\n&gt;&gt; Original Setting<br />\nGriblers are unusual creatures, mushroom trolls, who are indigenous inhabitants of an area called The Everwoods. We did not copy tired, classic fantasy with dwarves and elves. Instead, you will plunge into a new world with unique characters, funny dialog and unusual gameplay.<br />\n&gt;&gt;And the most important thing...<br />\nGriblers is a pet project, not aimed at getting money out of players. The gameplay is built in a way to make you enjoy the strategy game, without having to watch the same ad a hundred times for things you don\u2019t really need.<br />\n<strong><em> So, are you ready for an adventure? </em></strong><br />\nSpring comes in The Everwoods, and griblers Croxy, Squashy, and Rusty decide to go back to their ancient homeland. Help them to defeat the enemies, restore Hardwood and bring back former glory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T21:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df3aa22268f550961fa76f89629500b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Anton Lovygin"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Anton Lovygin"], "esrb_rating": null}
