The tiles have been shuffled out of their memory addresses, and the screen looks like \r\n\tnonsense.  It is your task to put tiles back in their proper addresses and fix your games!<br/></p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo do that, you \r\n\ttelepathically access the NES's internal Picture Processing Unit and <em>use a</em> <em>keyboard or gamepad</em> and <em>on-screen GUI</em> to swap tiles between memory addresses.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTry playing with a \r\n\t<em>USB controller</em> and pressing <em>F11 to view full-screen</em>!  Progress is saved automatically each time you complete a level, so you can <em>exit and return later</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tBased on \r\n\t\r\n\t\u633f\u9053 from My Famicase Exhibition 2015!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Bring Order From Chaos With This NES Glitch Simulator [Kill Screen]</li><li>Talking About \"Picture Processing\" with Frank DeMarco [Tech Raptor]</li><li>Pixels - For Free!
