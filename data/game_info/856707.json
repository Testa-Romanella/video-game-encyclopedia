You\u00a0must recharge the drained power-cells around the ship in order to save the ship and the humans on board.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Controls</strong></strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Movement</strong>: \u00a0WASD / Arrow Keys / Click-and-drag<br/>\n<strong>Restart</strong>: R</p>\n<p><strong>Intro text</strong></p>\r\nMESSAGE RECEIVED.\r\n<br/>\n<br/>We are in quite a dire situation here.\r\n<br/>\n<br/>We're far too close to SOL-34. The solar flares have wiped out all of the ship's power cells.\r\nThat means oxygen will be offline soon, and gravity, and.. well, everything.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOur scans suggest that you've been affected by the flares too, but you've been given too much power.\r\nThis is a problem for you, too.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHere is the directive. <br/><strong>One</strong>: Travel around the ship and re-charge any power cells you find. <br/><strong>Two</strong>: Regularly visit your personal docks for maintenance.\r\n<br/>\n<strong>Three</strong>: The solar flares are periodic. If you time it right, you'll be able to gain more power from them.<br/><br/>Good luck.\r\n\n<p>Created for Go Godot Jam 3 Ultra.<br/>Theme:\u00a0<strong>Too Much Power.<br/></strong>Unfortunately couldn't submit due to payment problems between UK and EU. \ud83d\ude22\ud83c\udf0d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T07:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc04c6bfe90c85e951d5c03c8d8d041a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mallardbro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
