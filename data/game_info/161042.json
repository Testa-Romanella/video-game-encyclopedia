Press space bar to release the ball, and unlock movement of the platform. Use arrow keys to move the platform.</p>\n<p>This was one of the very first games I ever made. It is admittedly quite basic, and was not intended to be any more than that. Feel free to use any of my game assets if you'd like. Given that the XNA Framework is no longer supported by Microsoft, I can no longer open the source code, therefore it goes without saying, there will not be any updates xD<br/><br/>Installation Instructions:<br/>1. Run the self-extracting ZIP file<br/>2. Install the XNA Framework redistributable within the \"Redist\" folder<br/>3. Start the \"Breakout.exe\" executable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcb/fcbf129686129e19d313cdd2b956d3fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dnnp2011"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
