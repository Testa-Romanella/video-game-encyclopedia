You work in a team with two to four players and an angry garbage truck driver. Your job is to empty garbage cans and containers. Sadly, your contract doesn't state what kind of work you are required to do, so your boss loads you with all kinds of extra tasks, including firefighting and forest work. Naturally you are completely understaffed, and your short-tempered driver has no intention of stopping the truck to wait for you, just because you couldn't empty all the garbage cans while extinguishing a raging wildfire. Luckily, there are heaps of powerups that help you with all those tasks, so your stress level won't reach dangerous heights... Or so you thought! Due to an accident in your bosses DIY time reverting device, you travel back into medieval times with seemingly no way to return and to make matters worse, your contract states that you are still required to work! So better get yourself a sword because the town is in the middle of a siege!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Gameplay</h3><br/>Garbage Crew! is a roguelike, action, couch-coop game, where, to archive victory, you and your team must make a fight plan on how to coordinate your operation to complete all incentives and make it to the level goal in time. Don't worry if you need a few tries, you\u2019ll earn money with every run, so you and your friends can choose from a lot of different powerups that will help you in your next playthrough! While in game all kinds of unexpected events occur so make sure you come prepared to adapt to all circumstances! After all, you are doing like 5 jobs at the same time, all while the town is actively besieged!<br/><br/>The game features endless randomized levels in two completely different settings each with a lot of unique mechanics to make every run a new challenge! <br/><br/><h3>Multiplayer Only!</h3>In Garbage Crew! you need to communicate and cooperate to bring order into chaos. Workplace regulations wouldn\u2019t allow for only one person to shoulder all those responsibilities, so please bring at least one friend to keep those pesky lawyers away. Don\u2019t worry if the size of your couch isn\u2019t sufficient to fit all your friends, the game fully supports Steam Remote Play Together so everyone can play from everywhere in the world!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><ul><li><strong>Endless Random Levels</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Two completely different settings</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Local Coop</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Online Coop via Steam Remote Play Together</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Tons of powerups</strong><br/></li><li><strong>All the jobs you\u2019ve always wanted to try\u2026 at once!</strong><br/>- Waste Collector<br/>- Firefighter<br/>- Forrest worker<br/>- Knight<br/>- Truck Driver<br/>- Car Mechanic (Or at least someone that pushes a truck uphill)<br/></li><li><strong>50+ Different Skins</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Play a level with a custom seed or with custom difficulty</strong></li></ul><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-11T04:11:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c83/c83feea982964d6dc999fd3d35548c69.jpg", "website": "https://garbagecrew.rocks", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 405, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["xeetsh"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["xeetsh"], "esrb_rating": null}
