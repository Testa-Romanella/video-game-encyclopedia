So the longer you play the better the AI will get, so don't worry if you see them chasing their own tail, they are learning.</p>\n<p>The game stops at the unlock of the second power, will keep building this out more if you guys like the style and controls.</p>\n<p>Hope you guys like the experience as much as I did, I've always wanted to fly in VR as well as do some cool energy blasts like in a certain anime.</p>\n<p>Best of luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T14:53:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d9/6d9f06a9702cb99b1a4682975c1160aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["REMInduced"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
