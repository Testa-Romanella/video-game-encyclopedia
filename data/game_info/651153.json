It is a full sequel to Yearning: A Gay Story (YAGS), taking place during the spring semester of Chris' Freshman year of college.<br/><br/>As ZAGS is a proper sequel to YAGS, you may wish to play YAGS through at least once before playing this game, as ZAGS will spoil major plot points of YAGS. However, prior knowledge of the characters or universe are not required to enjoy this game. ZAGS is more dating-focused, and contains more adult content (including CGs), than YAGS, so you should be of legal age in your region and be willing to view adult content to play.<h3>Demo Features</h3><ul><li>An open storyline based around a weekly event planner<br/></li><li>50,000+ words<br/></li><li>3 sexy CGs and 2 bonus images<br/></li><li>3 optional (and replayable) minigames<br/></li><li>A variety of \"routes\" to follow</li></ul><h3>Full Game Features</h3><ul><li>240,000+ words<br/></li><li>24 CGs and 13 bonus images<br/></li><li>12 optional (and replayable) minigames<br/></li><li>Four (and a half) romantic routes, plus plentiful side stories<br/></li><li>A bunch of unlockable extras, such as development notes and lyric videos</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T18:01:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/987/98719b89ce213738d08f5e09ad69daa0.jpg", "website": "http://bobcgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["bobcgames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Project Ens\u014d"], "esrb_rating": null}
