This is my entry for the Retrograde Jam 3 - Chain Reaction - a little casual game developed using my own low level pixel engine (LiteGameEngine). The purpose of this engine is to display pixels procedurally like did our old video games consoles. I struggled hard in order to play with alpha, but the result is good enough. I use this engine for mathematical demonstrations, low level applications and sometimes games for Jam sessions. The rules are simple : click on the screen so as to create a first circle which starts a chain reaction. You have to erase 80% of bubbles to get to the next level. Each new level, you decrease the numbers of bubbles on screen - so you increase the difficulty...\r\n</p>\n<p>Developing this code in pure C++, I liked to play with structures and some mathematical theorems like smooth lerping and distance computation. I had fun creating it. The final renderer reminds us an old Atari 2600 or 7800. At this stage, the engine is a beta framework. Maybe you will have some errors playing. Let me know the information like needed libraries or something else. I wonder if it runs as a standalone application - there is a single exe file. I guess. Thank you for your help :)</p>\n\n<p>I would like to add some words about the short procedural track. All is generated using a one-line C++ algorithm. It is really hard to create something relevant, but sometimes it works. Take a look at those examples.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T10:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbdb106fe0ac8601034f2dbd5917dd1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
