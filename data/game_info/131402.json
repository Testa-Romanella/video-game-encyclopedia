Each one represents something about me, from my mental health issues to things about my body that I don't like. You can interact with them by clicking on different places of the screen.</p>\n<p>I'm still developing this, so all the feedback you give me will be very appreciated. Only consider that this is not really a game, but an interactive experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, because of the stuff that appears on screen, this title could be triggering to some people, even if it doesnt include explicit violence or extremely disturbing things.\u00a0I, for example, couldn't have played comfortably to this when my mental health was worse. If you have any questions about this, contact me whenever you want (or if you want to talk about anything).</p>\n\n<p>Btw the game crashes sometimes in my computer the first time I run it, just restart it and everything should be fine.</p>\n\n\n<p>\"PxPlus_IBM_BIOS\" font by VileR is used under the\u00a0CC BY-SA 4.0\u00a0license.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6f/e6f3ec20b09895e91c3dea34a046a104.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gleaf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
