Compete against others or try to get your name on the leaderboard. Grab your favorite outfit and head towards the top of the island. You can find the controls from the bottom left of the screen. If you prefer mounts, smaller ones, such as the roller skates or the skateboard, work the best. Use the scroll wheel of your mouse to adjust the camera distance. Double jump available.</p>\n<p>HAPPY RACING ^^!</p>\n<p>This game is made for Core Summer Games -Jam</p>\n\n<p>Big thanks to CC-creators:</p>\n<p>carmelgames: BANANA, Koawala</p>\n<p>Chipnertkj: Boombox</p>\n<p>Dracowolfie: Shark Squad, Wiggle Friend</p>\n<p>Fidasek009: Simple Watch Tower</p>\n<p>Keospec: Respawn on R Pressed</p>\n<p>LittleCreator: Model_Tiger_LC</p>\n<p>Loskii: Swim sound + default Water</p>\n<p>LuckofBuck: On Trigger Play VFX/SFX</p>\n<p>marious0423: Fixed Bridge</p>\n<p>NoobDadGamer: Low Poly Palm Tree</p>\n<p>standardcombo: Minimap UI</p>\n<p>togagames: Icy Sheet</p>\n<p>varglbargl: Birb, Toy Butcket and Shovel</p>\n<p>Vilva: Ultimate Obby Kit</p>\n<p>WaveParadigm: Player Bouncepad, Player List World Text, Race Goal</p>\n<p>Thanks to Keppu for play testing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-21T06:37:58", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NANIkisunami"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
