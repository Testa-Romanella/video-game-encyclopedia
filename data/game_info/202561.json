It changes every day and people make a lot of money playing it. There are other virtual stock market games out there, but they are all real time games. Real-time games take months or even years to play. That's why I created this game. To put simply, it's a stock market simulator that is made mainly for educational purposes.</p>\n<p>Over time I will update this specific version of the game. I'll eventually add in past stock value lookups as well as many more stocks. I will finish the tutorial later, but you can click around to figure stuff out. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d35/d3534aaab584f1d7cea09e892a52dab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sim2kid"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
