{"id": 7168, "slug": "the-quest-cursed-stone", "name": "The Quest - Cursed Stone", "name_original": "The Quest - Cursed Stone", "description": "The Quest - Cursed Stone is an expansion to The Quest, a beautifully hand-drawn, immersive and enchanting world full of exciting challenges. After enabling the expansion, you can explore new areas and quests. However, if you don&amp;#39;t have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.<br/><br/>The sea wind carries the sound of Banshees wailing or is it the keening of murdered innocents whose deaths need to be avenged? The Fishermen&amp;#39;s Fairweather Stone is cursed and the villagers are starving because their luck has turned bad.<br/><br/>Can you lift the curse and save them? It&amp;#39;s time to be heroic once more. Talk to the fisherman Dran Faircatch to find out what you must do. The task is not simple. You&amp;#39;ll need all your courage and keen wits to face the perils that lie before you.<br/><br/>To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Matras harbor and talk to captain Verra, then select &amp;quot;Cursed Stone&amp;quot; as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 16 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.<br/><br/>The Quest - Cursed Stone has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a2/8a22642a6352c4c57144b78f93a389c4.jpeg", "website": "http://www.redshift.hu", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Redshift"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Vilya, BT."], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
