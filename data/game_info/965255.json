It offers the freedom to explore as each player likes, always between the universe and aesthetic of backrooms and the found footage. You will be able to explore the liminal spaces in a way never seen before and in first person; the camera has an interface reminiscent of the old VHS tapes, and tries to be graphically faithful to the feeling you might experience if you were inside the backrooms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": true, "updated": "2023-08-23T16:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a3/6a38cb4b2bb61ab27baf2993673f6cca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
