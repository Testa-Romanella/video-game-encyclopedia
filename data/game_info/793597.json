These sheep move in every direction! Use the mouse pointer, click (not too much) on the sheep, take it and take it to the place indicated on the map which is currently at the centre of the level! The goal of the game is to be able to create a place within the indicated area with obstacles of all kinds where the sheep can graze peacefully without getting lost in infinity!<br/></p>\n<p>****</p>\r\nCONTROLS\r\n      \r\n         WASD\u00a0\r\n         Movement\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Hold middle mouse\r\n         Rotation\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Left mouse\u00a0\r\n         Grab sheep\u00a0\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Right mouse\r\n         Grab objects\u00a0\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Q &amp; E (while grabbing an object)\r\n         Rotate object\u00a0\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Right mouse (while grabbing object)\r\n         Put object to inventory\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Esc<br/>\r\n         Pause\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Hold left mouse (inventory)\r\n         Drag single items\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         Hold left mouse + control (inventory)\r\n         Drag the entire stack\r\n      \r\n   \r\n\r\n<p>****</p>\n<strong>ROAD MAP</strong>\r\nUI / UX redesign and new features\r\n<p>The user interface will be continuously improved with more options and menu improvements, taking into account player feedback and new features (build / purchase)</p>\r\nGraphics and map display\r\n<p>The whole image of the game will be slowly redesigned through a new hand-made stylized texture.

These will be used to make the gaming experience even more interactive and complete.</p>\r\nNew assets and secondary mechanics\r\n<p>To conclude and give a further and strong impact on the game, the seasons will be implemented and the night/day cycle improved. Each season will have its own characteristics and custom assets. It will also be possible to use objects that will help you in your work as a shepherd.
