This is my third game made alone for a Game Jam.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Fortress\", and the limitation was that the player must control multiple entities. Therefore I decided to make this quick paced game about two gardeners! They must help their kingdom and protect its fortress from... ivy.</p>\n<p>It is a simple game, so I don't plan on making much more out of this. However, I would appreciate your feedback!</p>\n<p>Thank you for checking out my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T02:28:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb4/bb449b623181cf753bc593fb85e4baed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alex Flowers"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
