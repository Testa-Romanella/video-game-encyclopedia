This game truly tests your brains skills!<br/><br/>CONNECT SAME NUMBER TILES!<br/>If the tiles are same color, the numbers are added.<br/>If the tiles are different color, the numbers are subtracted.<br/>These are the basic rules. It's easy and simple to play, but challenging to master!<br/><br/>MASTER THE SPELLS!<br/>Learn lots of unique spells!<br/>Can you find the best way to master them?! Don't forget that your way of thinking is true magic!<br/><br/>CREATE NEW LIFE-FORMS USING THE POWER OF ZERO!<br/>These are extra helpers to make you stronger. When you create ZERO many times, an egg will hatch and reveal a new Life-Form. Give them lots of love!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/827/827790a1616d90deb03b7390ab28539e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["greentail"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
