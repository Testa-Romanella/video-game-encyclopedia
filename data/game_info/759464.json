It's very basic, but contains fun gameplay elements. In short, this game is not for everyone, it's difficult and you're not gonna coast through it. Bosses are hard, enemies are hard. Especially at the early levels when death is only cure-able at churches in town.<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>700 years ago, the world of man was a place of peace. People lived their lives without fear, and mankind flourished. It didn't last. A great evil emerged, and laid waste to civilization. When all hope seemed lost, a hero stepped forth, and turned the tides of war. He pushed the evil ones back, and saved our world. Peace returned, and lasted for many centuries. But history has a way of repeating, and darkness always returns. A putrid force is working to bring true evil back to our world. The hero who saved us is long dead, though he has but one descendant. That descendant, however, is no hero. With no intention of defeating the coming evil, but rather bringing it forth. It seems a new hero is needed, one who can stop this new force, and save our world from annihilation.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>- Classic NES-era and SNES-era RPG gameplay.<br/><br/>- 10+ hours of gameplay.<br/><br/>- Optional bosses.<br/><br/>- Optional dungeons.<br/><br/>- Fully functional Caterpillar System.<br/><br/>- More than 150 different monsters.<br/><br/>- Numerous secrets and side quests to discover.<br/><br/>- Multiple Endings.<br/><br/>- Highly Polished (spent many hours beta testing, and gathering user feedback)<br/><br/>- Challenging game balance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T11:00:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/117ff9ebd63c89e81f30c3038543a7a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u00c6on Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
