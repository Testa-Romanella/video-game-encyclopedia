It is the first console installment of Call of Duty. It was followed by a sequel, Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, in 2005.<br />\nAlthough it is based on the original Call of Duty franchise for Microsoft Windows, it has a completely different storyline and acts as a side-story/expansion of the main game. In the spirit of previous Call of Duty games, it features six intertwined stories and battles based on real events from the perspective of soldiers on each side of the allied campaign (U.S., British, and Soviet).<br />\nThe game&#39;s music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who previously worked on the original Call of Duty and the Medal of Honor franchise. AC/DC singer Brian Johnson provides the voice of Sergeant Starkey, one of the British commandos.</p>", "metacritic": 76, "released": "2004-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-21T18:12:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/62090243f90cade14f89281eceb9400f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 30, "beaten": 69, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 17, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 50, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 29, "reviews_count": 50, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2", "Xbox", "GameCube"], "developers": ["Kuju Entertainment", "Spark Unlimited", "Exakt Entertainment"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard", "Activison"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
