You must go out into the middle to catch fish, and then back to the edges to deposit the bones. The more you catch, the more score you'll get!</p>\n<p>Be careful however, the more you eat, the slower you'll go, and maybe another surprise is in store.</p>\n<p>Controls - A and D to move, SPACE to deposit what you've eaten into the boxes.</p>\n<p>All credits can be found in game in the About Me page, please give it a read.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T03:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726f9aef874075ed2ed08143084ed487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlexSowT"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
