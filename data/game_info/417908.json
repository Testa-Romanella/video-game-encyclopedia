{"id": 417908, "slug": "equipmentris", "name": "Equipmentris", "name_original": "Equipmentris", "description": "<p>Equipmentris is basically a turn based combat game where gearing is a simple block fitting mini-game in itself. Each won round of combat nets you either a trusty new companion or a shiny piece of loot. How far can you get? But beware, the swift death can lurk at any corner. And the death is permanent...</p>\n<p>The game was made in a week for #7DRL and my\u00a0idea was to combine\u00a0a few of much enjoyed games from my childhood of early 90s. The first part is not Tetris really but some quite obscure and not widely know suitcase packing game I can't even remember the name of. All I remember is that I enjoyed it and most likely played way too much of it considering how simple the premise was.</p>\n<p>The second part comes from a Finnish indie classic, Areena (Finnish for arena, obviously). Well the combat is nowhere near like that and it could come from anywhere, that is where my main inspiration came from. Even though quite a lot of the features and mechanics had to be scrapped due to the week of development time flying by way too quickly.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T02:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b54f43d4033a592a9f9e593c4f5469c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["anttihaavikko"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
