But if you are selected to be a part of this elite alien fighting space force then your name will be etched in the stars of valor forever.<br/><br/>Power-Up Your Play Style: Acquire unique and game-changing Enhancements for your Shifter that will dramatically alter your strategy and play style for the run.
