With every game map being randomly generated, from terrain generation to structures and loot chests. So there's no need to worry about map knowlege or camping spots. When you are transformed you're never out, there are ways return to the game so you are never out completely!<br/><br/>This is a game in development, characters, equipment and items will be added as time goes on and we as developer and players work out what works well for the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T15:53:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc9/cc995a0438652dc6cdf99571d51c1d9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hypno Horse"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hypno Horse"], "esrb_rating": null}
