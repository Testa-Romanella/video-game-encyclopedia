However, your paddle inputs are affected by lag. Fight to get closer to the WiFi signal in order to reduce the input lag while beating your friend at Pong.</p>\n<p>This 2-in-1 game was developed in Unity within 24 hours during the LHUxKDU game jam to fit the theme 'Connection'. It was a team of 1 designer/artist and 2 programmers. I was involved in mainly developing the Pong segment of this game and helping to integrate the lag system.</p>\n<p>The game was great fun to develop as it was the first time I developed a polished game in less than 24 hours. The constraint taught me the importance of planning and ensuring the scope of a game is manageable.</p>\n<p><strong>This game is available to download at the bottom of this page.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0&lt;-- Back to Chan Yuen Theng's portfolio<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Role</strong></p>\n<p>Game Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Contributions</strong></p>\n<p>Below are the details and my thoughts on my contributions to this project.</p>\n<ul><li>Pong gameplay\r\n<ul><li>I set up the paddle and ball movement of the Pong section of the game.</li><li>Also implemented the score system.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af87b8ef10bc4e53cf34781ecdd696b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chan Yuen Theng"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
