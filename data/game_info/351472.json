Expect the unexpected as this clown takes you through a world of imagination. <br/><br/>In Ayo\u2019s hometown, things are generally peaceful. He juggles in the park with his talented circus dog, Bo, hangs out at the carnival, and longs after the shoemaker\u2019s daughter. Until one day, his dog goes missing! <br/><br/>You play as Ayo, your not-so-average clown embarking on an epic journey in search of his missing (or perhaps ran away, or kidnapped?!) best friend and beloved dog, named Bo. What happened to Bo? Will they ever juggle together at the park again? Or put together a legit circus act? You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as you struggle to reunite clown and dog. Like all good adventures, you won\u2019t be all on your own.
