To do so you must get stronger. When you believe you are strong enough you may take on the big red dragon. Will you emerge victorious or perish like all the rest who tried to take on Big Red?\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Dragonslayer is a game that is played with the mouse only. The game mostly consists of turn based combat and small amount of world interaction. But for those who look deeper, the game has quite a few secrets hidden away. This game is a great background game to play when you don't want to focus too intently on playing a game, such as when listening to a podcast, talking with friends, or waiting for something. The game is inspired by Swords and Sandals II and Dragon Fable.</p><p>PRESS ESCAPE FOR HOW TO PLAY\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T05:48:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b3/7b3da223812970cdbd44591bcdb2b8d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueBallsTime"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
