What lies should a fortune teller tell to give hope to their patrons? Will you try to steer customers towards better options, or prioritize profit?\r\nThe controls are entirely mouse-based, left and right click. You might have to resize the window if the UI isn't working correctly. The tutorial is built into the game and readily accessible when necessary.**Note since I forgot to put it in the tutorial,\u00a0that your capital will only increase if you decrease the uncertainty of a patron, otherwise your capital will decrease. Additionally, if the game appears to be not accepting input look at the output panel in the bottom right and left-click anywhere on the screen to advance the text**\r\n\r\nThe download version is slightly more stable than the web version if it's giving you issues.Thank you to\u00a0LehouxGD for help with some art assets!\n\n\n<p>Please note that any beliefs held by a character in the game are not necessarily my own and are placed there for the purpose of challenging the player.
