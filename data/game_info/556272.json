Bragging rights baby!  It's best played with ten friends, but if you have less that's ok too.  One person is the host and the others are players.  Everyone gets a number (0-9) and when the game goes to commercial you add the last digits of the score and the last digit of the sum is the winner.  Example:  the score is 25-28...the winner is 3.  5+8=13 and the last digit is 3.  You can set the credit level each commercial break so the excitement never ends!  You won't believe how much fun games are to watch when you're playing Go To Commercial!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/718/7183f623e533e339cc596105e770b079.jpg", "website": "https://gotocommercial.app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Go2Commercial"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Go2commercialgame"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
