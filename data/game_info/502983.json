Collect gold.

Maybe one day it will become a publishable game, but for now it is just a hobby project.</p>\n<p>Constructive feedback appreciated!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>NOTE:<br/>Current version supports xbox controller only.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T06:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a18/a18b9b4a6d7a50005a53ae6ac53ddde1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ialokinmloh"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
