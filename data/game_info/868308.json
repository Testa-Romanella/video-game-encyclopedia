If hostiles are too close, no territory will appear to build on. You can only build when paused.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want to save a build, you can select and copy it to the clipboard as text, then paste it back in later or share it with others:</p>\r\n\r\n  /h\\c/h\\     /h\\c/o\\c/h\\              \r\n/t\\s/o\\s/t\\   \\t/s\\g/s\\t/   /h\\c/g\\c/h\\\r\n    \\t/       /c\\h/g\\h/c\\   \\t/o\\s/o\\t/\r\n              \\h/t\\o/t\\h/     \\t/h\\t/ \r\n\r\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Use the sandbox to try different builds. Press 'F' to switch factions to place opposing units. Be creative and see if you can find any overpowered builds!</p>\r\nParts\r\n<p>Each placed part has a power level based on its proximity to cores (L1 within four connected cells, L2 if adjacent, L3 if two cores adjacent). A higher level means more damage, shield strength, or thrust. Parts glow with the faction color of the core that claims them. Parts unpower when no core is within range.</p>\n<p>Parts also need support. You start with 10 support points by default and can place storage parts to increase support further. If support drops below zero, parts will begin to unpower and jettison.<br/></p>\r\nKnown issues\r\n<ul><li>Safari: May run at lower framerate</li><li>Safari: Clipboard copy/paste does not work</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T07:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/15717778420dc7a3f12827f3cd8c8e2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cragwind"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
