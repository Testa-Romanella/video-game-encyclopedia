In our game, a young adult engages in a journey to find and accept himself, going through the darkness of the cave until reaching the light and whatever awaits him in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>The player will enter a room and, after a quick analysis of its contents, he will be able to think of a viable route to get through it. To push forward he must jump between platforms, dash multiple times, and manipulate the room's content by changing its predominant color, repeating the cycle until finishing an area and proceeding to the next one, where new kinds of interactive elements and platforms will be presented, resulting in a major ambiance change.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul><li>Spacial puzzle solving - Each room presents a different challenge.\r\n</li><li>Color specific elements - Chain the different colors' elements to complete levels.\r\n</li><li>Multiple level paths - Different kinds of players may find different ways to complete levels.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\nTeam:\r\n<p>Game in development by Doomers Inc, a development team composed by students.</p>\n<p>Guilherme Saturno - Lead Game Designer &amp; Project Manager</p>\n<p>Lucas Viana - Systems Programmer</p>\n<p>Pedro In\u00e1cio - Gameplay Programmer</p>\n<p>Rita Saraiva - Lead Game Artist</p>\n<p>Ticiano Vieira - Sound Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T14:37:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/232/232a0bdc3184e9b5c05d91d9b94d1706.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doomers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
