{"id": 964088, "slug": "project-sphinx", "name": "Project Sphinx", "name_original": "Project Sphinx", "description": "<strong>Project Sphinx is a first person puzzle platformer, in which you make your way through a space station by teleporting.</strong><br/><br/>In Project Sphinx, you take the role of a robot sent to a seemingly abandoned space station by a corporation. Your mission is to retrieve crucial data left somewhere on the station's premises. Unfortunately, as is often the case with derelict facilities in the middle of the galaxy - it's in a state of absolute mess and chaos.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You're going to have to make your way through destroyed halls, broken down stairways and rooms with seemingly no way out. But you're not just any robot. You're a unit equipped with PAWS - the Portable Arm-mounted Wormhole Slinger (name not approved by the Galactic Corporations Committee). This highly advanced piece of future-tech will let you turn your robot hand into a ball, shoot it, and teleport to it after it bounces off of any solid surface! No, this is not a lie. This is what the future looks like.<br/><br/>Using your teleportation power along with your puzzle-solving and platform-jumping skills, there's no way you won't be able to complete your mission. Right? RIGHT? Well, only one way to find out!<br/><br/><br/><strong>FEATURES:</strong><br/><br/><strong>- Teleport to explore and progress</strong><br/>Teleportation is the main means of traversal in the game and it is FUN! You're going to be using your PAWS to jump through the portals you create in order to fulfill your mission. You can teleport almost anywhere, but the blue pools of liquid look pretty dodgy - don't teleport into those, please.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>- Fast paced traversal</strong><br/>Use your skills and bounce around FAST! You can use your robot legs to walk around, sure. But you're a robot with a hand that shoots teleportation portals. Now that sounds like something that could make you go quicker. That's what every robot learns at the \"How to go fast, have fun and not lose too many screws\" course in primary school, anyway. It's common robot knowledge.<br/><br/><strong>- Mind (and coil) bending puzzles</strong><br/>Think the mission will be a walk in the park? Don't worry your little robot head, it definitely will not. You'll have to use every bit of your computing skills to make your way through the station. Rooms will be PUZZLES, corridors will be mazes and your wits will be what sets you apart from other robots on the block.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>- The ricochet mechanic</strong><br/>Teleporting is cool, but there's a trick for it to work. To be able to do it, you have to RICOCHET off of a wall, or any other solid surface, first. Sounds complicated? It's not. Sounds exciting? You bet it is! Thanks to that, you'll be able to gain momentum and speed needed to solve puzzles, move faster and - as an added bonus - look like the coolest robot ever.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-28T05:48:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d7405337b3e8cd8dc49bd7c9753f42ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 34, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 428, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Blockout Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Awaken Realms"], "esrb_rating": null}
