Features will try to get to your game and when they do, they will show up in top right corner - those features can be worked on.\u00a0</p><p>To complete a feature you need to deliver a number of puzzles to a game. You do this by touching the game with puzzles in your backpack. Puzzles are assigned to features in order from top to bottom. The number and type of puzzles that need to be delivered to the game are represented by colored blocks (which given feature consists of).</p><p>To catch a puzzle, simply walk or jump into them. Puzzles represent a work that need to be done in game development: green - design, blue -code, red - art, yellow - sound.</p><p>You need to be careful not to let too many features at a time - if you let more than four, you will enter a \"feature creep\" mode. In this mode, the puzzles you bring will be distributed randomly between features, instead of in order from top to bottom. To keep features from getting to game, you may need to destroy them by shooting them.</p><p>Bugs and procrastination monsters will spawn from time to time. Bugs will try to get to your game, and when they do, they will substract work done from random feature.\u00a0Procrastination monstres will simply try to get in your way by pushing you around, making your life harder. Both bugs and fetures can be shot.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03fc232167c256af06b5dc2bbc22ef9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["bartosz.mazur90"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
