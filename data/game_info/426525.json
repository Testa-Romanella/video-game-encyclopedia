The war has finally ended. The kings have decided to send their best warrior to a tournament.

Welcome to a battle of unbalanced characters, in which you can differentiate the genres of characters: Shooters, Tanks, fighters, warriors, magicians, summoners ...<br/>Don't be surprised, if you see that your enemies have much more or much less life, speed, attack damage ... Each character is different from another, even within those of the same genre you can find differences.</p>\n<p>Use different tactics to win. Here anything goes: You want to run away from your enemies until the moment of truth,\u00a0 run away; You want to use ranged attacks all the time, do it; You want to heal yourself, prevents you from being hit for 10 seconds; You want to be invulnerable,\u00a0 you press the shield button very fast all the time.
