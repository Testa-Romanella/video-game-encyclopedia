So far I think it's a pretty decent engine.</p>\n<p>I tried to match the theme \"Tell a story using sound,\" which is what the knocking/tinging sound is. It gets louder as you get closer to the truth.</p>\n<p>There are three endings in the game but the game itself is pretty basic. I tried to keep the complexity down since I was learning an entirely new game engine. Godot is easy to publish to the web and is easy to rapidly develop small projects. I still have a ton to learn though. I had to cut a lot of what I\u00a0planned and I'm not even sure the story and game works all that well since I didn't have\u00a0time to take a step back from it.</p>\n<p>All code and assets were created in this jam in the last two weeks, except for the player character, which was taking from another of my projects and redone a bit, and the font which I created a while back.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-18T00:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88c/88cb69e265509f04829616df25a1a764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dev Pirates"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
