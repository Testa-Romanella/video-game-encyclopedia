The game references St Anne\u2019s wood and holy well in Bristol, UK (once considered a potent holy site in Medieval England), and more generally the folk magic of healing Clooty Wells. Surface of Scum is made entirely with free, open source, browser-based software.</p>\n\n<p>Game made using Bitsy (by Adam Le Doux), with these additional hacks: Mixsy by Ruin,\u00a0Bitsy audio hack by Mark Wonnacott, Custom Key Handler by Sean S.
