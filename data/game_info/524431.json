The central theme is \u201corder\u201d (fusing entities into one) and \u201cchaos\u201d (splitting entities into several).</p>\n<p>In each hand, you have a VR controller with the ability to attract or repel objects. There is a burst of power when clicking either button, which switches to a lower power stream if you continue to hold either button.</p>\n<p>Your objective is to fuse all objects into one. The environment produces 2D black triangle antibodies that sever entities back into their separate pieces and\u00a0bubble-like antibodies that bring the separate objects back to their initial position, fusing them back together.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Paul Gasca\u00a0- Designer /\u00a0Producer</p>\n<p>Alex McChesney\u00a0- Lead Programmer</p>\n<p>Andrew Jeannett - Art</p>\n<p>Jared Farney\u00a0- Composer / Sound Design<br/></p>\n<p>Olivia Elmers - Programmer</p>\n<p>Roberto Pena\u00a0- Programmer</p>\n<p>Stephanie Traska\u00a0- Art<br/></p>\n<p><em>Created for VR Austin Jam 2020</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:58:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/712/712aefbaa734f6fc8e199e682cc7f351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Washing-Up Software Projects", "ertopena", "VideogameScrapbook", "VRStephanie", "bloopyturtle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
