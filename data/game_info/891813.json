This game is associated with The Puzzle for 2022 Day 6. You are tasked with tuning a communications signal by detecting the lock-on packet. In part 1, it is 4 consecutive unique bytes. In part 2, it is 14.</p>\n<p>This game visualizes the Part 2 task. The input is my own, and slightly modified to help the game end sooner (you don't need to get to 3,215 like my answer was ;)). You will detect and throw away duplicates in order to lock in on a 14 length string of unique bytes.</p>\n\n<p><em>What's that?</em></p>\n<p>WE GET SIGNAL.</p>\n<p><strong>MAIN SCREEN, TURN ON!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T07:10:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c57/c5770fef41ece6adb4e0fc67aced8a3c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Mr. Tim"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
