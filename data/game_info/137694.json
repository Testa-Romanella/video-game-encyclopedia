Ultimately the game's concept is flawed, so\u00a0we're moving on to our second title while we figure out how to fix this one. Something is slightly off...</p><p>Controller Clash is the first (and hopefully not only) game from Burpy Fresh, the people who've brought you nothing else other than a moderately funny indie game review site (burpyfresh.com)! You play as one of the four (mostly!) stationary controller buttons in a battle to the finish! Hit your own button to defend, and an opponent's button to strike! But be careful, you can only perform one main action at a time (and that includes attacking and defending)!</p>\n<p>Tap the D-pad once before firing/defending and see what happens!</p>\n<p>Use L1 and R1 to shimmy away from or towards your enemies!</p>\n<p>FEATURES</p><p>Windows, Mac, and Linux ports (Though I can't test Windows and Linux. Help?)</p>\n<p>Rich hastily made single track audio OST, available for download on nothing.<br/></p>\n<p>Four player multiplayer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Supports PS2 (with GamePad Companion) and PS4 controllers, though PS4 is not tested yet.</p>\n<p>Localized into Japanese and Korean for some reason! </p>\n\n<p>TO DO</p>\n<p>Make it actually fun</p>\n<p>Make both instruction menus behave intuitively (Had to change one last minute)</p>\n<p>Support for more controllers. (And more controller button types!)</p>\n<p>Polish, polish polish.</p>\n\n<p>Constructive feedback highly appreciated. Anyone mocking the project should be clever and witty, to soothe the pain.</p><p>Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/@burpyf...</p><p>Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/burpyf...</p><p>Website: http://www.burpyfresh.com</p><p>Email:\u00a0burpyfresh@gmail.com</p>\n<p>It's Almost Fun (TM)!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f4/3f4c56da0f003a1193cb4138f79c1522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Burpy Fresh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
