Up to 4 people can play. There is 2 different modes for \"easy\" or \"normal\" game play. This version does not have a nudge or tilt. The next version should have those upgrades. For now, I am looking for some feed back on the game play, esp. if you have played the real machine. It can be used with the keyboard or game controller. There is a camera follow mode that can be toggled on/ off by the \"F\" key of the Y button on a game controller.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T13:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b42/b42af97e2977315721d9a174c9a978ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DLG Creations"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
