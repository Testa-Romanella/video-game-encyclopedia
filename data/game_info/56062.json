It was released in Japan on April 25, 2003. Despite that its last showing at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) was in English, Nintendo cancelled the North American localization of GiFTPiA. In English, the game would most likely be better understood as called \"Giftopia\" to represent the two words, gift and utopia.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04b/04be103ec08c079f44c1181eb2930b5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 328, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["SKIP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
