The goal is the same: Clear lines to gain points. However, you only gain points for the blocks in your color, and the only way to turn blocks into your color is to push them! <br/><br/></p>\n<p> <strong>FOUR PLAYER MULTIPLAYER!</strong><br/> Up to four players going at it, and only one can win! With either a time limit, score limit, or no limit at all, anything's fair and anything goes as long as you're the winner! Do whatever you can to destroy your opponents - jump on them, crush them, or trap them, and then steal their points!'</p>\n\n<p> <strong>MESS WITH THE GAME RULES!</strong><br/> Playing field too thin? Blocks fall too fast? Perhaps you'd like to triple the game speed? Blocko STE comes with the ability to modify the game to make it play however you want it to! There's never a dull - or fair - moment when there are so many falling blocks that your character can't fit on the screen, and guess what, <em>you can make it happen!<br/></em></p>\n\n<p> <strong>CREATE YOUR OWN THEMES!</strong><br/> If you're bored of the themes supplied with the game, you can easily make your own themes. Use the provided templates in the <em>Themes</em> folder and draw away! Draw swear words, scale down some anime, it's entirely up to you!<br/> You can even draw your own clothes, hats or faces for the little guy, just go into the <em>Accessories</em> folder and hack away!</p>\n\n<p>Graphics - Thomas McCloskey (@Gypopothomas)<br/>Music - Eirik (@strotchy)<br/>Coding - Bisse (@SveTob)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T07:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba5d9c0f385a2b09f8607b9e035011e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Perfect Run"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
