From there, things start getting weird for our hero.</p>\n<p>The current demo is where the project is at after about 2 weeks of progress, and features the first area of the game to be included in the demo. Currently no combat is completed, but the area is about completed. There are still a few bugs in the player controls, but this is what I'll be primarily working on now.</p>\n<p>The health and stamina system works perfectly, which is controlled through a heart\u00a0rate monitor visible on the screen. This will eventually be visible on the players arm as a smart watch. Although it works well, the only thing that can currently kill you is drowning.</p>\n<p>As there's no inventory or object interaction, all you can currently do is explore the level. This demo is primarily for testing and proof of concept at this stage. Stay tuned for future updates.</p>\n<p>The menu is only basic at the moment for functionality.\u00a0Controls are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>W, A, S &amp; D to move and strafe.</li><li>Use mouse to look around.</li><li>Press shift to run.</li><li>Press Space to jump.</li><li>Press Z to crouch.</li><li>Mouse wheel to turn your flashlight up and down.</li><li>Mouse middle button to turn your flashlight on and off.</li><li>Escape to exit the game and return to the main menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T05:53:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/505/5054ac947d90501161a8bf6527ea4d46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Quantum Nexus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
