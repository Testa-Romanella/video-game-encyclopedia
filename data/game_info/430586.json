They will take a spot on the dancefloor if there's room available. If there's no available spots, they will go somewhere else (without penalty).<br/>- Dancers on the showfloor are bad mannered and they will use nasty moves to increase their boredoom.<br/>- If a dancer becomes bored (snoozemeter is full), they will leave (and you won't be able to recruit them).<br/>- You *WIN* when the morning comes (ie. there are no new arrivals - after about 16 people)<br/>- When the prefered music style of a dancer is playing, they will become entranced. Entranced dancers don't use any moves when their ATB gets full but any moves against them are inneffective.</p>\n<p># Your techniques</p>\n<p>Disco:<br/>- [W] [Z]: the target becomes more susceptible to get hyped (next hype action against them gets +1).<br/>- [E]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01 hype to everyone.<br/>- [R]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every dancer becomes a Disco fan.</p>\n<p>Funk:<br/>- [W] [Z]: Extra hype to the target (ie. +2 hype to them).<br/>- [E]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slightly removes boredom from everyone.<br/>- [R]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Removes all the target's boredom.</p>\n<p>Rock:<br/>- [W] [Z]: Changes the target's next action to tantrum (+1 boredom to self)<br/>- [E]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stuns the target for 2 turns. A stunned target won't attack.<br/>- [R]:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stuns everyone for a turn.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T06:01:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f81368f190b38a5bd0dae9de1d129f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bar0net"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
