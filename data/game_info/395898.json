On the 2nd and 3rd roll you can choose which dice you want to reroll, and which you want to keep.</p>\n<p>Watch out! Roll any ghosts and your score will be zero, unless you can get a spooky flush of all 6 ghosts, that is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc08ee99ceb2ffdcbef56deb9a1dee17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDevDan"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
