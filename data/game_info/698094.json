{"id": 698094, "slug": "santas-gift-leaving", "name": "Santa's Gift Leaving!", "name_original": "Santa's Gift Leaving!", "description": "<p>Christmas season is near and it is time for Santa to leave new gifts to everyone!</p>\n<p>I present to you the official entry for the GJL Game Parade Jam with the theme, \"Leave Something Behind\". I took a different approach to this theme as gift giving will leave a mark for everyone. This time, you can use Santa to give gifts to everyone especially if you are nice! Ensure that you keep this as a secret. Finish giving and leaving the gifts in other people's doorsteps before the time runs out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can control Santa by using WASD key.</p>\n<p>Use E key to pick-up the gifts or drop them to the door steps.</p>\n<p>Use Esc key to open the menu.</p>\n\n<p>This game is solo developed but the assets where obtained and edited in a way usable for the game jam. All credits are in the Credits portion of the Main Menu in the game. Time spent everyday is 1-2 hours only due to busy schedule for work but was able to make a game that might last for 10-15 mins. More levels to come after the jam if revisited/have positive feedback.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you guys enjoy it and Merry Christmas everyone!\u00a0:D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:13:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a9b241ec0e23a68822b7b879c4baddf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Aqua Magneto"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
