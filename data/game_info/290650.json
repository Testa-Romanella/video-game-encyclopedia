Everyday life has to be managed: Doing laundry, sorting papers, cooking, watering the plants etc. A home can only work if both partners team up and help each other out. The game represents exactly that: You live together in a flat and have to do chores in order to have some freetime later. Different chores will pile up and you only have several ingame hours to do them!<br/><br/>Art &amp; Dev by DUI</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b1/9b1f880b3aa6a5f261d0074d0d465660.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DU&I"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
