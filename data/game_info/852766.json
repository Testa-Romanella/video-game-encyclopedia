Discipline and excellence are a must for every young cadet.<br/>Sophisticated weapons and strong fortifications make their bases almost impregnable.<br/><br/>The Redaxh definitely do not look human. More like insects, ugly insects.<br/>The technologies are massively different from the other factions.<br/>The weapon systems are incredibly advanced and devastating, but the structures look fragile. Still, you'd better run from their arms.<br/><br/>Everything about the Zan seems cobbled together.<br/>Weapon systems seem outdated, not made for open combat.<br/>On the other hand, they are extremely adept at attacking from ambush and are difficult for the enemy to see.<br/><br/><br/>\"A business that only makes money is a bad business.\"<br/>- Henry Ford<br/><br/><strong>Economy</strong>:<br/>Mines, generators, and hard-working drones are the backbone of your economy.<br/>Collect as much crystal, titanium, and energy as possible to keep your war machinery running.<br/>No war can be won without a functioning economy.<br/><br/><strong>Research</strong>:<br/>Better to have stronger weapons or faster production?
