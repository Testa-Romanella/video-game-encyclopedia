We even lower the music a couple of notches! <br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>Match 3 games are puzzle games. You need to match 3 or more objects by sliding rows or columns with your finger.  Matched pieces are removed from the board and new pieces dropped back onto the board.  The object is to clear the board and advance to the next level.<br/><br/>If you're unsure of the next move then press the hint button for some help. The board will darken and an arrow will show you a row or column to slide, with a starting piece and a target piece. Slide the starting piece in the direction of the arrow, until it arrives at the slot previously occupied by the target - you now got a match! Alternatively, you can rotate a quadrant of the board by pressing one of the rotate buttons that are situated in each corner of the board. <br/><br/>Matching 4 or more  pieces can trigger the spawning of power ups with special abilities, helping you clear larger areas of the board:<br/><br/>SPECIAL PIECES<br/><br/>\u2661 Cool As A Ninja <br/>This laid-back cherub wants to help YOU!
