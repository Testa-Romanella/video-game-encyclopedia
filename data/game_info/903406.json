And so the group starts trying to figure out who is trying to kill Daniel. Will Daniel and Amelia figure out what's going on and why is Daniel being targeted with Evan and Lucy? Find out when the mod releases!</p>\n\n<p>The story of Tuesday Night Troubles takes place 3 weeks before Christmas. Everything was going smoothly for Evan and Lucy until they reached a traffic block on their road, which leaves them no choice but to use rooftops to go to their destination. On their way to their destination, they see a man standing on a rooftop. They go to the man to see what they're doing. After Evan and Lucy had gotten behind the man, the man finally noticed their presence behind him and he turned around. The man asks what they were doing on the rooftops and Lucy explains why. The man understands them and says that there's nothing to do about those traffic blocks. Evan then asks the man his name and the man said his name is Daniel. Evan asks Daniel if he wanted to sing together but Daniel said that he had to go somewhere but it shouldn't be much of a problem for him, so he took the request. But he did not know what events he will set himself into.</p>\n<p>Play the mod to find out the events what he will set himself into!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T08:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81f0fa2c331952e72aa92adc03989c28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daniel-RJ47min"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
