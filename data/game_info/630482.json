It took me almost two months to get to this result from almost zero knowledge on 3d games, and I really learned a lot from it.</p>\n<p>It currently covers the basic elements of call of duty zombies, with some simplifications due to my inexperience and lack of resources. I will probably do a sequel with better graphics and animations in the future, but for now I want to close this project and experiment with new game genres.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T17:42:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c80/c8023e4294e1e33554f0b17ffd00e6b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 295, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["nyre221"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
