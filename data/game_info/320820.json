We wanted to do it from scratch to have total freedom and to learn something in the process. To keep things simple, we chose to create a Space Invaders clone. <br/></p>\n<p>Alien Invasion is entirely written in C#, using DirectX 10 with SlimDX and a self-made rendering engine, asynchronous resource management, the FMOD audio engine and utilizes a component-based game architecture. We even have a little LISP interpreter for our resource files! (Yes, we are totally aware that this is absolute overkill for a small game like that. But as I already said before this wasn\u2019t about the game, it was about the experience and trying stuff we wanted to do<em><em>.)<br/></em></em></p>\r\nSource Code\n<p>As of 2016, the project can also be found on GitHub at the following location: https://github.com/StarforgeGames/alien-invasion</p>\n<p>Have fun with it!<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to all people who contributed to this project.
