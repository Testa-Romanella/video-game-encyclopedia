These clients will open up emotionally to him and tell him about their problems and lives. Every night, depending on the customer we attended the night before, we will see how the bar is filled with souvenirs and gifts made by satisfied customers.</p>\n<p>Every time you play, the stories of the characters can vary, as well as their outcomes and gifts. We\u2019ll see if you can get them all.</p>\n<strong>MEMBERS OF THE TEAM</strong>\n<p>Aitor Gonz\u00e1lez - Programmer</p>\n<p>Diana Montoro - 2D Character artist and Animator</p>\n<p>Max Montalvo - 2D Prop and Enviroment\u00a0Artist</p>\n<p>Luis Sagastibelza - Game\u00a0designer and Producer</p>\n<p>Alvaro Valencia - FX sound artist and Music composer<br/></p>\r\nIMPORTANT STUFF\r\n<p>Except for the song of \"<em>Al calor de un amor en un bar</em>\", which belongs to the group Gabinete Caligari, all the other effects of audios and music are own and original compositions created during this jam.
