{"id": 271039, "slug": "the-holiday-junction", "name": "The Holiday Junction", "name_original": "The Holiday Junction", "description": "The Holiday Junction: Jingle Edition is an action game that plays with one simple objective in mind: Turn toys into wrapped presents to get the highest score.  With the help of Uffda, the Northern Spirit of Cold and Lefsa, and the Holiday Junction, can you complete this challenge before the train returns to Santa?  Naughty elves stole Santa\u2019s new Christmas sleigh along with all of this year's toys.  The fleeing foes were  taken down with a giant candy cane, but the impact scattered toys all over the North Pole.  Uffda will help raise the toys from the land, but The Holiday Junction crew needs your help to plunk the toys with Uffda\u2019s magical snowballs.  These merry munitions instantly wrap presents and drop them into the train cars.  We only have one day to rescue and return the toys safely, so don't delay!  But be careful - a few dastardly elves are still on the run and will stop at nothing to spoil the holiday.  Return the toys, avoid the coal, and SAVE CHRISTMAS!<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>Quick Play:  This is a gallery game that you play in under five minutes.  Kids and parents can jump in and out of a play-through in a short period of time.  Share turns quickly with a family member or friend to compete for the high score.<br/><br/>Randomized Play:  You can play The Holiday Junction: Jingle Edition over the course of four levels, and the gallery action is randomized so the game plays differently every time.  Can you get the high score and save the Christmas holiday?<br/><br/>Game of Skill:  Focus your action skills and quick reflexes to improve each play-through. The quicker the reflexes, the higher the score!  Kids can challenge their family and friends to test their hand-eye coordination.<br/><br/>Choose your conductor:  Choose one of three animal conductors to drive the Holiday Junction train.  Each animal has its own unique power object to throw instead of the standard magical snowball.<br/><br/>Power ups:  The more gifts you retrieve, the faster the power meter fills up.  When the meter fills up, the player has access to the conductor's power object for a short period of time.  Polar Bear:  Peppermint Candies!  Walrus: Gingerbread Cookies!!  Penguin:  Lutefisk!!!  Shown as a cod, because really. . .who wants to throw a gelatinous glob of lye soaked fish?!<br/><br/>Naughty elves:  Scattered throughout the game are ELVES!  DIRTY DIABOLICAL DUBIOUS ELVES!!!  They'll be carrying bags of special gold-wrapped gifts.  Enough hits will retrieve the gifts and send the pointy-eared abominations to oblivion! <br/> <br/>The Presenting Tree:  Level 4 has a special feature called the \"Presenting Tree\".  If you can figure out how to light the tree and you light all four of the tree's sections, you will unlock the Presenting Tree and receive a bounty of gifts that will make even the tiniest of hearts grow three times larger.<br/><br/>Fun for all ages:  The game was designed for all ages.
