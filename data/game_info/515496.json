When the rage gauge is full, release the power of the bear and destroy the opponents' will ! When an ennemy is in fear and you kill them, you'll regain life points. Don't forget to keep an eye on the dagger at the top right of the screen to find your next victims.</p>\n\n<p>Music by Anton Shilo :\u00a0\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/c/AntonShilo/featured</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T04:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ee/2ee56fa304754372b2f19b91427177cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Morgan Cnudde", "MaximeDesc."], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
