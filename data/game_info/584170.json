In my game, the player realizes that they have suddenly entered a mysterious series of rooms with no memories of how they got there. Each room looks vastly different from the last one and there seems to be no connection between them at all. The only link is that they all have puzzles leading the player closer and closer to the exit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T02:49:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/2072617b3f5e47cacb59b6cbb143e9f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maggie Smith"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
