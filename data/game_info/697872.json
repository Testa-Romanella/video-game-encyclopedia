Slowly but firmly, the Europeans have risen into power, and the traditions and beliefs of the Muisca fade away as the foreign culture blends into their daily life, and the catholic priests punish their celebrations as heresy. The cultural heritage of the Muisca is at risk of being lost.<br/></p>\n<p>In the Muyscubun of Bogota, the language spoken by the indigenous Muisca people inhabiting the lands around the central Andes in Colombia, Muyscamuy means \"The Maize of the People\". Like many other inhabitants of the Americas, farming of Maize or Corn was a very important aspect that impacted their culture both in the ordinary and the sacred.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits!</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Illustrations and UI: David Florez (simernio)</li><li>Audio: Juan Carlos Garc\u00eda (QuietGecko)</li><li>Narrative Design: Esteban Martinez</li><li>Linguistics and Cultural Research: Manuel Gomez Aguaqui\u00f1a</li><li>Programming: Santiago Zapata (slashie)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T05:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc9deb4cb25a3f879fece26bddf35810.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Slashie"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
