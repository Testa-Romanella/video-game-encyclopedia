I hope I can sensibilize animal abuse this way (and even more in next versions), that's why I decided that every donation for this game will be splitted in two:\u00a050% will support\u00a0the game development and 50% will be given to peta or any other animal supporters you choose, I'll also put a name list of every contributor if they like, just make sure to let me know your name in the comments or something :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T08:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e15/e15a8ef2acd8d248c89c242dc07c4ab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sai Yaku"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
