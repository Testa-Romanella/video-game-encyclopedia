Although the story does not explicitly focus on the struggles one encounters in school, I used the dialogue portion of the game to communicate themes of restlessness, boredom, and the overall apathetic attitudes the character has towards their monotonous life. There is no direct objective. Just enjoy reading the story through a pixilated\u00a0gaming environment.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T09:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02e/02edb6f493aa02c44a673a726995f41c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yousef1378"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
