{"id": 842194, "slug": "boxgun-mop_bucket", "name": "BoxGun (mop_bucket)", "name_original": "BoxGun (mop_bucket)", "description": "<p>A first person 3D platformer with a shooting/building mechanic used for navigating the level and completing puzzles. Made to demonstrate a limited lifespan ranged block placing mechanic. Also contains some additional puzzles which demonstrate other interesting platformer/puzzle mechanics that make use of a shooting gun/ranged tool.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blocks can be shot to build across or up to platforms and over dangerous obstacles. A slow moving projectile is shot from the players gun which creates a block at the point of impact.\u00a0Since the blocks have a limited lifespan this creates a level of difficulty because the player will fall if a block they are standing on disappears.\u00a0Various puzzles use different mechanics (eg shoot to destroy existing blocks rather than create new ones) but instructions are provided for each puzzle individually.\r\n</p>\n<p>Background music is\u00a0also made by me.\r\n</p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>Click to shoot and mouse to look around. WASD to move. Space to jump. There is a bug where if you die and return to checkpoint you always face the same direction even if it is the wrong way so be mindful of that especially in sections that look similar in each direction. Press M to mute/unmute music and N to mute/unmute all sounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bc/6bca0ff5cf9fc39e0b4b9d9d3c729b8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mop_bucket"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
