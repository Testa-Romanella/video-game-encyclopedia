This game was made for VR Jam 2020 and all assets (with the exception of music) were developed for this project by me. This game was made with Unity &amp; Steam VR 2.0 so it supports the Vive, Index, and Oculus headsets (as long as the game is being run with Steam VR). Windows Mixed Reality support is buggy and may not work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:47:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dce7c45a7c80e55df278f055b957849.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trisol"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
