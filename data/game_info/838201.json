Rolling on an old monitor cart with some car batteries strapped in it is on an adventure to explore the world now. Only one small issue, it is not able to travel over grass or climb up cliffs, yet. So you have to help it! Build platforms and ramps to help it find all the golden CDs so it can learn more about the world, who knows what it will do once it knows more?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls/tutorial</strong>:</p>\n<p>Use your mouse to click on the platform types (on the right edge of the screen), they will be \"attached\" to your mouse as long as you hover over the map area.</p>\n<p>Right-click to rotate the object you are holding by 90\u00b0</p>\n<p>Left click to place the object in the current position (be careful, there is no way to move the objects after the fact!)</p>\n<p>Click on the \"GO\" button in the bottom left of the screen to tell your robot to start, it will try to reach all \u00a0CDs, starting with the closest ones first.</p>\n<p>There is no menu/setting/pause/restart screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Information:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Engine: Unity</p>\n<p>Code, Textures, Models and Game design were all done by me during the duration of this jam. This was my 3rd ever jam, 2nd time in unity and 1st time I went for a 3D game. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c3/3c3d7e35ba79b00b11fe16663f40efb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["NBGamer"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
