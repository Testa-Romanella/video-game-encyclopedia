There was a war, long time ago. People started it to capture this unique knowledge and gain power over everything. Rherion could not bear this war anymore, therefore he destroyed his physical body and created some sort of sanctuary so the knowledge is not lost, and could be still recovered.</em></p><p>My very first experience in making a game in Unity.
