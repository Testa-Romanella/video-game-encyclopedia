But first you need upgrades. Navigate the maze to find and collect oysters. Take your oysters back up to the boat to sell, but be careful, you need to make it back to the boat before your oxygen runs out otherwise you lose your oyster haul! Use your money to buy upgrade your diver until he is strong and fast enough to find and catch the super oyster, 'Mega Jug'</p>\r\nDev Thoughts\r\n<p>Had a lot of fun with this Ludum Dare,\u00a0I worked solo again, wasn't expecting the event to be on until late March but when I checked earlier in the week I was surprised to see it so early. Initially didn't really like the theme of harvest, but I promised some friends I'd make a game about oysters...? Expanded some of my gamedev knowledge by building a shop and upgrade system, as well as a probability based spawning system.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Dad and Josie for helping and play testing.<br/></p>\n<p>Dev ChangeLog:</p>\n<p>Fixed Bug: Sprites not showing correctly</p>\n<p>Fixed Bug: Timer broken</p>\n<p>Fixed Bug: Sound too quiet</p>\n<p>Known Bug: Controller not working in browser</p>\n<p>Added: Clarity on how to play<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T17:31:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebc0042725687b5983625d61998383ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Osh Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
