Explore procedurally generated cave systems, and go deeper and deeper into the mine to collect all of the required materials needed, and bring them back to the drop box. Ores include iron, gold, and diamond, and each time you play, you are tasked with a different required amount of each, and an entirely new cave system to explore!</p>\n<p>There are 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. Easy has the smallest cave size and hard has the largest cave size where ores are more dispersed and harder to find.</p>\n<p>Easy Difficulty: 32x32 map, collect 10% \u00a0of ores.</p>\n<p>Medium Difficulty: 64x64 map, collect 20% of ores.</p>\n<p>Hard Difficulty: 128x128 map, collect 20% of ores.</p>\n<p>Controls: Arrow Keys to move, X to break block (based on arrow key direction), Z to place block (based on arrow key direction).<br/></p>\n<p>Written in Golang using Ebiten and my custom Golang toolkit to provide functionality such as collisions, gravity, viewports, etc. I spent a lot of time this weekend implementing and polishing more actual game functionality than working on the game itself, but it was fun! I worked on this intermittently, so it wasn't ready for compo, and it definitely needs more polish, but I'm happy to submit it to the jam!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T20:06:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb333edff4e985abeed2f9f039d7f38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ndrw"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
