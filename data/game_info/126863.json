Move with WASD or Arrow keys. Shoot with Left Mouse button or Punch with Right Mouse button. Kill the rats and absorb their souls to heal yourself and absorb their mutation. Unlock the leap ability and jump with space followed by Q to leap forward mid air. Find the vents spawning the rats and close them with E - when you have enough souls. Watch out for the green poison rats which can be attacking you from a distance. <br/></p><p>Team VerminScourge:</p>\n<p>Programming -<br/>Connor Barthelmie : connor.barthelmie@gmail.com<br/>Divij Sood :\u00a0 Dyonisiandesign@gmail.com<br/>Art -<br/>Rebecca Tipler : rebeccatipler@outlook.com</p>\n<p>George Garcia : Garcia.illinois@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Audio</p>\n<p>Miroslaw Sieniewicz : battleangelmusic@outlook.com</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db5/db5058d0c3c3455fab22b8cac46d81e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dyonisian"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
