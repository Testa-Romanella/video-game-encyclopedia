By finding all the anomalies and putting them back in their rightful place, maybe he can put a stop to this madness...or maybe not...<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:\u00a0 WASD to move, SPACE to jump, and E to interact</p>\n<p><strong>Content</strong>: All the code and graphics were made by me during the game jam, except for a few sprite assets from OpenGameArt.org. The audio came from various online sources, but the main song is\u00a0called Warped\u00a0by Alexander Ehlers (on Open Game\u00a0Art).</p>\n<p><strong>Retrospective</strong>: For this game jam I really wanted to test myself and see how much I could get done in a week. I'm fairly new to Godot, but have learned enough to make simple 2D games such as this. At the beginning, the scope of my game was much larger and as time progressed\u00a0I realized that making graphics from scratch and doing all the coding myself was taking longer than expected. I didn't even add any audio until the base game was complete. Overall though, this was a lot of fun for me because I'd never made a story based game like this before. It was the first time I'd ever implemented a dialogue or inventory system on my own and it was exciting to write a story based on the theme of parallel dimensions. In all honestly, I don't consider this a very \"fun\" game, however, it was an excellent chance to test out my Godot knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find this to be an interesting prototype for what could someday be a much larger and more in depth game about time travel!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T03:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e87/e8704564b0e3e947d86ad80d42c6660a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jaristotle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
