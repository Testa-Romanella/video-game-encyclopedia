Vicious BEMs (\u2018Bug Eyed Monsters\u2019) developed by the evil genius scientist Doctor Benomiya have escaped containment and gone berserk.<br/><br/>The Super-Electric Research Center deploys the space combat craft \u2018ZanFighter\u2019 to the fortress of Benomiya on a mission to end the onslaught of the BEMs before they end civilization. <br/><br/>The small, but powerful ZanFighter is equipped with the super weapon \u2018Warp Slash\u2019, which makes it the only craft capable of surviving the myriad of traps in Benomiya\u2019s fortress and countering the BEM menace.<br/><br/>The battle begins: Earth\u2019s most powerful combat craft against the galaxy's deadliest threat.Hyperdimensional Fighter Craft \u2018ZanFighter\u2019A space fighter craft developed by the Super-electric Research Center, home of the legendary giant robot Supercharged Robot VULKAISER.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ZanFighter specializes in close combat and possesses a variety of special capabilities including \u2018Warp Slash\u2019 and \u2018Dimensional Shockwave\u2019. Its sophisticated and highly advanced automated systems allow its pilot to concentrate on maneuvering, firing the weapons, and effectively utilizing the warp functions listed below.<br/><br/><strong>Warp Slash</strong><br/>The Warp Slash is a more advanced version of the \u2018Tokitome Warp\u2019 used by the combat android \u2018Meguriro\u2019 during the Gogoh War of 1977. When activated, the warp effect stops time and transmits the ZanFighter almost instantaneously to the designated coordinates. <br/>  Warp transmission utilizes multiple dimensions, allowing the ZanFighter to pass through any type of physical matter, including enemy bullets and obstacles. At the same time, it inflicts slicing damage upon any enemies that lie in the path of the warp.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dimensional Shockwave</strong><br/>This area-effect attack inflicts damage upon any enemies present at the warp destination upon completion of the warp. Both the \u2018Dimensional Shockwave\u2019 and \u2018Warp Slash\u2019 make use of the distortion in the fabric of space caused by warping.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Decoy</strong><br/>Projects a holographic image of the ZanFighter at the warp origin. The hologram acts as a decoy, distracting enemy visuals and sensors, and drawing their fire. Decoys will disappear after a set amount of time, but a new Decoy can be redeployed at the ZanFighter\u2019s current position when the warp is engaged again.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Magno-Electric Shield</strong><br/>A defensive shield that can protect the ZanFighter against one enemy attack. The shield activates when the shield energy reaches full charge. Shield energy charges automatically and also increases when enemy capsules are collected.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Omega Crash</strong><br/>Triggers when the Magno-electric Shield deactivates. Massive energy stored in the shield is instantly released, inflicting large damage on enemies in the surrounding area.
