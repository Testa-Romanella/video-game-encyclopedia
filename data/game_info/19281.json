{"id": 19281, "slug": "dustforce-dx", "name": "Dustforce DX", "name_original": "Dustforce DX", "description": "<p>Dustforce DX is the updated version of Dustforce, a platformer game where you need to clean up the world of dust. DX update added new maps and music. The tutorial was also redesigned to be friendlier to newcomers. In fact, DX version extends the game\u2019s audience from a very hardcore to the medium one, giving more time to master the gameplay.</p>\n<p>As a part of a four-member team (with AI teammates or in co-op with real players) you go through levels cleaning them and fighting monsters you meet. There are four playable characters in Dustforce, however, they differ only in the appearance with slight stats\u2019 changing. </p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to reach the other side of every level and kill enemies there.  You can perform different moves, featuring jumping, climbing walls, several attacks and so on. The game places a heavy focus on timing so overcoming numerous obstacles become very challenging.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2012-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-28T01:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7fb42b2115c3730c00248dafe57e2d0.jpg", "website": "http://hitboxteam.com", "rating": 3.22, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 106, "owned": 1727, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 64, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 1, "ratings_count": 91, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 91, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hitbox Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Digerati Distribution"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
