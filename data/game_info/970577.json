Countless men are turned into hyper masculine brainless zombies. Is it an infection? Perhaps mutations? Who knows. Some agents and experts have been dispatched to investigate this problem. They need to fend off the muscle zombies and attempt to find a cure --- one way or another. This is an erotic adult game featuring ballbusting and heavy bdsm. There are two independent versions: ALL MALES or FEMALE DOMINATION. All males version features full cast of muscular men, whereas for the femdom version the controllable characters are all females while the enemies are still male muscle zombies. The game play itself is a new take on tower defense, where 3 lanes are guarded by 3 characters. Every round the player can use acquired items and then fire a shot in one of the lanes. When a number of enemies are taken down, the player wins. If any enemy reaches the end of any lane, the player is defeated. There are many ways of customizing characters and story progression, including 3 different main stats for each of the characters and 3 linked stats for items. Player will have to make choices in the story progression, the path forks into two directions from mid-game and there are 4 different endings.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T16:17:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/837/837d42051e7453d3a7012b9442a3170f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Aaron Dodo"], "esrb_rating": null}
