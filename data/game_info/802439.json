Your primary goal is to find the best way to eat all dots. Due to some toxic sea creatures either wander around their territories or hold their grounds, you will have a great challenge to survive. Sharks are difficult to deal with, so you'd better hide and stay still while sharks swim over the coral maze at night to hunt. For every few seconds, a dot turns into a power dot. After you eat the power dot, you are able to fight back against enemies. To win the game, you need to eat all the dots up and also game results are effected by how you interact with the other sea creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAn overall score in every level will record your achievement and your game strategy.
