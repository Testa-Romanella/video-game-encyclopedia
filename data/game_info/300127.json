The details are hazy, but memories of a wild party, followed by an unwise combination of unusual mushrooms and a ouija board, suggest that things may have gone a bit too far. Something alarming moving in the shadows suggests they went far too far.</p>\n<p>All our hero wants to do is go to bed, in the hope that a good sleep will make everything go away, however his maid has other plans. The house and grounds are mess; detritus is spread far and wide; strange creatures are roaming the halls and something suspiciously like a portal to another dimension appears to have opened in the basement. This all needs to be sorted out before anyone is getting any sleep.</p>\n<p>More venerable players will enjoy the walk down memory lane, with subtle - and\u00a0not so subtle - nods to the worlds of yesteryear. More innocent players will get to experience what life was like when they were not so much as a gleam in their parents' eyes.</p>\n<p>If you would have any feedback on the game, please feel free to leave a comment below, or contact me at oclipa.com.</p>\n<p>If you would\u00a0like to help me maintain this game and produce others, please consider\u00a0supporting me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bfb/bfb284cffb3f6a918953c80d91063403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oclipa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
