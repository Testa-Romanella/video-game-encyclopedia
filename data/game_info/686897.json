{"id": 686897, "slug": "chicken-loop-overlordnikita", "name": "Chicken Loop (OverlordNikita)", "name_original": "Chicken Loop (OverlordNikita)", "description": "<p>Chicken Loop - game project made for Mini Jam event.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: that this game is far from completeting and there are may be a lot of bugs.<br/>This is prototype version that I have made for 2 days. So gameplay is kinda chunky and first scene. Well, it is a test scene :D</p>\n<p>Rules:<br/>There are 3 teams of chickens. Each have own camp (fire). You need to find eggs and bring them closer to fire of your camp to spawn new team members.</p>\n<p>From egg can spawn two types of chicken - Warrior (with a spear) and egg courier. Chances are 50/50. Courier only looking for eggs and can't fight. Warrior only fight and can't take an egg. Only you can do both.</p>\n<p>Game ends when one team left or when you die.<br/><br/>Theme of the Jam is \"Death\".\u00a0<br/>So here is an infinite loop if chicken lives =)<br/>When chicken dies it becomes an egg. Then from this egg spawns new chicken and so on.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Limitation \"Health is your weapon\".\u00a0<br/>This one I planned to implement through the \"eggs like a currency\". Where you can spent them to create new building or spawn new chickens. The more you have eggs - more powerful you and your team (Like a health bar in the context of your team). And when you out of eggs - it is pretty much the end. I wanted add tactics to this game. Something like that. But I\u00a0had now time to implement it properly, so I\u00a0this limitation implemented only partially.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music was taken from these sites:<br/>\"Epic Battle\" by Twin Musicom (twinmusicom.org)<br/>and\u00a0<br/>\"Curious Squirell\" from Zapsplat.com<br/><br/>P.S. Yes, this idea is my old idea that I tried to implement long time ago. You can find it in my games list.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T03:00:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8b/b8bb2d6facb8c388f165b1fba0689ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OverlordNikita"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
