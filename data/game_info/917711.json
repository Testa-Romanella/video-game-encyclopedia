Please try another browser.</p>\r\nFINAL NOTES\n<p>This is my entry for <strong>BIRTHDAY GAME 2023</strong>! It's an indulgently overscoped prototype dungeon delver smashing together a lot of things I love from both old and modern games. Because of the self-imposed time limit I had no time to implement things like combat, puzzles, or other fun stuff beyond basic mechanics and rudimentary tilesets. That's okay: DELVE has soft potential and I had a great time working on her.<br/>If you want to give me a birthday present, you can choose to donate when hitting the download button, but for as long as DELVE remains a busted little prototype, she will remain free of charge! Thank you for taking your time, and leave a comment<em> \u2665</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T12:35:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/108/10865df3c14b00f1320b0d32ebc27835.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DREAMSEED"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
