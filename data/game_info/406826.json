Also, that would be a nightmare. I like shooting projectiles at you anyways.</p>\n<p>---<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered what it was like from the bosses perspective.</p>\n<p>Well now <strong>you can.<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>public void SwitchPlayerAndBoss() { } \u00a0&lt;- uh oh, oopsie that went in there by mistake!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Backstory:</p>\n<p>I was planning to make a bullet hell game but lets say I had to code a bug in else I wouldn't be able to compete in the THEME category. So I just made a quick function switching the player and the boss; modified some code and it worked out pretty well.</p>\n<p>---<br/>Goal:<br/>Your goal is to <strong>kill the player</strong>, no matter what...</p>\n<p><em>Try to get the best time if you want. The faster you manage to kill the player the more challenging of a level you will be.<br/></em></p>\n<p>----</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that's it. It honestly turned out really well for me.</p>\n<p>I coded, designed, and made all the art myself. Sound effects were designed in bxfr.</p>\n<p>The battle music you hear in the background is 2k19 Battle Jam from Meganeko.</p>\n<p>https://meganeko.bandcamp.com/track/2k9-battle-jam</p>\n<p>Also check out me on Youtube! <br/></p>\n<p>But yeah, enjoy the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:56:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/461/46153907cd8fa9076ba15bfa8ff8d5df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SkyanSam"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
