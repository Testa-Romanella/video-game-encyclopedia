Will you meet your perfect waifu, form a harem, or simply enjoy your time with the goddesses?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWaifu Collector is a light adult visual novel / dating simulator, which rewards your progress with gacha-style card drops of different rarities, out of a pool of over 150 tradeable and marketable cards. Typical drops per tier include the following:<br/>\r\n- Common: base images, no nudity - first-tier waifus only<br/>\r\n- Uncommon: lingerie for first-tier waifus, base images for second tier waifus<br/>\r\n- Rare: nude for first-tier waifus, lingerie for second-tier, base images for third tier <br/>\r\n- Super Rare: sexual interactions for first-tier waifus, nude for second-tier, lingerie for third-tier<br/>\r\n- Super Super Rare: sexual interactions for second-tier waifus, nude and sexual interactions for third-tier<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCertain actions and events may also trigger special card drops outside of these tiers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe core visual novel \"story\" is the length of a short novella: about 25 000 words. Each collectible card also includes a sort of adult-oriented mini-scene featuring that card's waifu, and these together account for another 20 000 words so far, with more cards already in development for planned free updates to the game. Collect them all to enjoy each waifu to the fullest!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWaifu Collector contains no censorship. It features full Steam Inventory support to record and track your progress. Cards may be traded freely between players using the Steam Community Market, and viewed using the in-game collection/gallery. Earn Steam Achievements as you grow your waifu collection!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a casual adults-only game intended to be played for no more than 15-20 minutes each day, though it may take a little longer the first time you play, and as you encounter each situation for the first time. There is no penalty for not playing on a particular day, beyond missing the card drops that you would have earned that day.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T16:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/47180cd77a29b97fa26efe298bb0cecd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Waifus"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Digital Waifus"], "esrb_rating": null}
