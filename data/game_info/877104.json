Gather  resources and build a defensible position before darkness falls. Survive the night  horrors, make repairs, heal, and prepare for more.\r\nEach night a greater terror hunts you. You just aren't wanted there.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\n<p>You sink your sailboat near a mysterious island. You have some emergency supplies but they won't last you long. You don't know how long you will be stranded there nor do you know what awaits you.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues </strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Autocollect items is a bug that prevents you from dropping them.  A workaround is to build a logpile to store them instead. Your starting  items are not set to autocollect so you can drop them if you need to.\r\n</li><li>The Options selections are a little glitchy. Make sure you start the game on Ultra settings to ensure the best experience.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Starting Tips</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Water is in short supply, but you can eat berries to hold you over until you find a freshwater source.\r\n</li><li>The night spawns will become increasingly difficult quickly, so waste no time building up a base.\r\n</li><li>If you find a rock, make a pickaxe first to mine nearby boulders. Then, make a campfire. Your starting resources won't last forever. Be prepared.</li><li>Berries and tall grass are often found together.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>BETA</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This project was created for the Soul Link Game Jam#1 in four weeks.<br/>Instances where Soul Link was used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nightly waves of creatures that escalate each cycle</li>\n<li>evening prey animal spawns</li>\n<li>butterfly accent spawns</li>\n<li>forest debris spawn</li>\n<li>rock debris spawn</li>\n<li>falling pebble sound spawn</li>\n<li>daytime predator spawn</li>\n<li>nightime predator spawn</li>\n<li>beach sounds spawn</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T12:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c34/c3449ebc512cb8c31f17277e35ec116d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Crimson Hills"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
