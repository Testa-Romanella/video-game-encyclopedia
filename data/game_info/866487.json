This is that game, this is my first Steam game and I hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed developing and playing it as I'd love to continue the support for the game after early access as long as there's people who still want it<br/><br/>Please keep in mind that I consider myself as a novice programmer and there are few game features that I'm simply not able to make such as online multiplayer. I plan to have more features in the game added during early access but they will remain hidden as I don't want to false promise people if it doesn't become a reality due to my lack of programming skills<br/><br/>Thank you very much for playing (or considering) my game,<br/>Gem", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T05:55:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/172c7c2c1809543a8055c2c9c1ebede7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gem Bear Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gem Bear Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
