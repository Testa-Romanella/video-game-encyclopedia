(only asteroids). The game also lacked a lot of things, like a decent menu, the key mapping screen (the internal system already has this, but you can't change it in the game). Missed Game Over screen and some powerups, sorry. I was planning to do a two player battle royale mode with capture the flag. Players could go into bases and there would be really cool stuff in there. In infinite mode I planned on switching the game to a procedural platform mode, before changing the direction of the ship, making the game more varied and fun.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>However, I loved making this game and being part of the Opera GX Game Jam.</em>\n</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! :D<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T13:00:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f707f8b9fbf624d1e346cfeceeda31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foxy Of Jungle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
