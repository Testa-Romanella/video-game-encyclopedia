Your mission is to free robots trapped in 45 evil<br />\ncomputer labyrinths while avoiding deadly traps. Sound easy? Not so<br />\nfast. Each robot shares linked controls, so when you move one, you move<br />\nthem all. It will take clever planning and nerves of steel to pull off<br />\nthis electronic escape. You&#39;ll need to avoid many traps, such as mines<br />\nor electrical circuits, and take advantage of special elements like glue<br />\nstains. Choose one of three difficulty levels and get ready for a<br />\nchallenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:37:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ef/3ef571b430f7a24097cdea42ee7b9b6d.jpg", "website": "http://www.teyon.com/games/robot-rescue-dsiware/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": ["Teyon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Teyon"], "esrb_rating": null}
