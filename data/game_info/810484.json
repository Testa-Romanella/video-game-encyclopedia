Can you travel through time to\u00a0discover how to\u00a0release him from a potential thousand years of incarceration?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Uncle Mortimer's Secret</em></strong> is a large text-only interactive fiction fantasy game\u00a0 involving time travel. It was\u00a0written from the ground up\u00a0for the PC using qBasic64, and has a comprehensive and powerful parser.\u00a0 Included in the game are detailed <strong>HELP </strong>instructions and hints (command <strong>HINT</strong>)\u00a0in a form similar to invisiclues. These can provide either gentle nudges or downright spoilers - the player's choice. Also inbuilt is full scripting <strong>(</strong>commands <strong>SCRIPT </strong>and <strong>UNSCRIPT</strong><strong>)</strong>, with the ability to view the script file in-game via the <strong>HISTORY </strong>command. The script file can be deleted as an option in the <strong>DELETE </strong>command. If the file 'Walkthrough.txt' is placed in the game folder, it can be accessed 'in-game' by the commands <strong>WALKTHROUGH </strong>or <strong>WALKTHRU</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>I have throughout the game\u00a0given information/hints about the time periods to be visited, but some Internet searches will probably be necessary for most players\u00a0 to determine the exact years. I think this adds to the challenge and therefore the fun.</p>\n<p>I have also uploaded maps for the entire game, but as these include <strong><em>a great deal </em></strong>of information, giving contents of rooms and similar, I'd strongly advise against viewing them other than as a last resort.</p>\n<p>For atmosphere there are a few decorative/non-functional rooms and one or two\u00a0red herring items, but I've kept these to a minimum. Several MP3 files are included in the downloaded zip file to produce sound effects, but presence of these files is\u00a0not essential for the game to run.\u00a0Sound effects may play either automatically in certain locations, on the occurrence of certain events\u00a0or as a result of the command\u00a0<strong>LISTEN</strong>. Sound functionality\u00a0can be toggled off and on\u00a0using the command\u00a0<strong>SOUND</strong>.</p>\n<p>Completion will take\u00a0 \u00a0a\u00a0<strong><em>minimum\u00a0</em></strong>of 300 moves (which I have personally achieved in a test run, avoiding actions which for a player would in practice be necessary)\u00a0and in all probability very\u00a0many more. If anyone wanted a detailed and fully-optimised solution (as opposed to a simple walkthrough) they could\u00a0contact me by email (command <strong>AUTHOR</strong>) and I'd be glad to send them an optimised\u00a0script file to insert into the game folder for viewing via\u00a0the <strong>HISTORY </strong>command.</p>\n<p>I can't over-emphasise that new players should read the <strong>HELP</strong> instructions before starting play. Although a lot of the information given therein will already be completely familiar to most players, there are some important specifics such as the method of taking items from containers and also the ability to define function keys to implement commonly-used commands without the need to type them in full.</p>\n<p>There are an additional three pluses to this game...<br/></p>\n<p>1. There is no possibility of sudden unexpected death.<br/>2. There is essentially no inventory limit.<br/>3. The player can never get into an unwinnable situation (AFAIK).</p>\n<p>Although written for windows on the PC it could be run on Linux using WINE and presumably also on MacOS using a Windows emulator.</p>\n<p>Many thanks go to Christopher Merriner and Heiko for their help in beta testing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T04:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b25/b25fa095e7506b0921aa8ad816fa8ac7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Older Timer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
