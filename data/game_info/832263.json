However, it should be noted that it is growing. The growth of the black hole can be accelerated as objects enter the event horizon.\r\n</p>\n<p>In short, your task is to maneuver the ship and avoid being pulled into the event horizon while destroying Asteroids to prevent accelerated growth</p>\r\nManeuvering the ship\r\n<p>\r\nAs the operator, you control the thrusters and the engine of the vessel.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe thrusters allows the vessel to make an in place turn while the engine propels the vessel forward.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBy using the controls provided, you can steer the ship to go to any point in space.\r\n</p>\r\nTargeting and shooting asteroids\r\n<p>\r\nIt is critical that asteroids must be destroyed before they enter the event horizon as it accelerates the growth of the black hole.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe vessel is equipped with precise targeting instrument and laser to facilitate this task.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWhen the precise targeting instrument locked onto an asteroid, it highlights the asteroid on your graphical terminal under a red square along with a direct trajectory to it. At this point, you simply need to press the button combination to shoot.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>\r\nThe following table uses the QWERTY keyboard. \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nIf you have another layout, you should be able to play the game using the first three buttons from the top left below the number row.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nHowever, you can remap the buttons by opening the settings menu by striking the ESCAPE key.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe controls are limited to three buttons as it is a one-to-one representation of the three bit length bit field data sent to the vessel. Transmission is severely limited as it is the only way to have robust and fast unidirectional communication to a long distant space craft affected by extreme time dilation and gravitational pull.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Button\r\n    Left Thruster\r\n    Right Thruster\r\n    Main Engine\r\n    Action\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q + W + E\r\n    -\r\n    -\r\n    -\r\n    Destroy target / Start game\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q + W\r\n    -\r\n    On\r\n    On\r\n    Move forward while turning Left\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    W + E\r\n    On\r\n    -\r\n    On\r\n    Move forward while turning right\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q\r\n    -\r\n    On\r\n    -\r\n    Turn left\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    W\r\n    -\r\n    -\r\n    On\r\n    Move forward\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    E\r\n    On\r\n    -\r\n    -\r\n    Turn right\r\n  \r\n\r\nAttributions\r\n<ul>\n<li>Bitmap Texture Font by Digital-Sin: https://github.com/Digital-Sin/BitmapTextureFont</li>\n<li>Godot SFXR by tomeyro: https://github.com/tomeyro/godot-sfxr</li><li>Noise Lines by Thomas Zucx: https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/noise-lines\r\n</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:21:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21a8408910115e173d66988ae306ad74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Yuki"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
