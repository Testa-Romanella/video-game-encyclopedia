It's actually the first game I've done for 7DRL, and my first completed game overall. <br/></p>\n<p>All code for the game was done in Python, using Pygame. Most assets and code were made over seven days (3/2/2019-3/10/2019), excluding background music I made in 2009, and some basic code salvaged from previous projects. Graphics were designed in GIMP, and sound effects made using Bfxr.<br/></p>\n<p>In Lexicon Hop, you explore two worlds to find tablets containing words, which, once learned, grant you new abilities or unlock new areas. The words you learn persist across runs. The main mechanic of the game is jumping, and it features light (top-down) platforming.<br/></p>\n<p>Currently, I only have an executable for Windows. If anyone else in the 7DRL challenge could help with creating Mac and Linux executables, please let me know!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:21:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a60/a600c2b27a6c678d1c5d909048fdba74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["voidset"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
