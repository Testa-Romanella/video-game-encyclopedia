Over the last two, ten week quarters, Fistful of Lasers has gone through many iterations. It was originally a tactical laser tag shooter influenced heavily by Rainbow Six, ShootMania and the likes, but has developed into what it is today.</p><p>Fistful of Lasers is a Sci-Fi/Western quick-draw laser tag game where players shoot at mirrors in order to hit their opponent first. It is a race to three wins in a best of five format. After each round the players will quickly spawn into another level/scenario where the player will have to quickly use a mirror to shoot the other player before being shot.</p><p>Visit our Website: </p><p>http://teampandagin.weebly.com<br/></p><p>Follow Us On Facebook &amp; Twitter!<br/></p><p>https://www.facebook.com/Fistful-of-Lasers-1217560...<br/></p><p>https://twitter.com/TeamPandaGin<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/255/255ead989a578881da43bcc01cd7ad65.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matt Novosel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
