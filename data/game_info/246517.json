Using our patent pending 'bits' you can build cool 3D pixel art that does some really interesting stuff.  Use our Battery bit to generate charges that flow through circuits of wire bits to charge various lights and gadgets.  Use logic bits like switches, memory bits, gates, capacitors, and multipliers to change and control the logic of the circuits.  We also include IO bits that you can link to your keyboard or controller so you can interact with the flow of electricity through your circuits and make even cooler stuff! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou can upload and download your creations to the steam workshop to show off your work or get inspiration from others too!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:52:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c13/c13ffb2189200b6703d6a8b5f30fc303.jpg", "website": "https://www.ahwilliams.net/blogicblox", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Alex Williams"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Grubby Monster Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
