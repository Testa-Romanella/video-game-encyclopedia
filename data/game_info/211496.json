Well, your only half wrong. Why the game may not be that scary, there is still a jumpscare. Also, the game might be very poorly built. It's also made to be spoopy, just like Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning. Just enjoy the game! ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d2539948338333f2d4ffaf2e9f045674.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["HollybloxCVA"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
