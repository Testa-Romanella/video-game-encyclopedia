But things doesn't turn out the way she was hoping for...</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>A very short interactive story-ish game, made for the Trijam #156 with the theme \"tea time\". Also, my first submission to a game jam ever. Development took much longer than expected and was way over the intended 3 hours of the Trijam. Still, was a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>The current version can be considered an alpha/prototype. I do plan to release a polished version of this game later. In particular, I want to add some music/sound effects, update some character sprites, and also, add a proper finale for the story.</p>\n<p>The game is made in WOLF RPG Editor. As such, the typical controls of the editor apply, i.e.:<br/>Movement: Arrow keys<br/>Confirm: Space / Enter<br/>Cancel / Open Menu: Esc<br/>Toggle Fullscreen: F11<br/>Toggle window size in windowed mode: F4</p>\n<p>Content warning: Violence, murder (it's really nothing extreme though. The game uses pixel graphics anyway.)<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits: This game uses tileset assets from\u00a0https://limezu.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T04:42:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54faf4058dbe161d575fa7c6768e8e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games of James"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
