Experience Aquascapers, a single-player and co-op aquascaping simulation that invites you and friends to discover and gather various ornamental resources for your aquascaping projects. Enhance your business and dominate the market!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Resources hunting is part of the players' activity prior to developing the desired layout and composition of the aquascape. Each item has a specific location that needs to be visited. There are four types of items that can be collected: rocks, wood, plants, and fish. Occasionally, certain types of items require special tools to obtain them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Co-Op Multiplayer is a feature in Aquascapers that allows players to invite friends or other players to join them in collecting hardscape items to create more captivating aquascape designs. By collaborating with others, players can enhance their creative possibilities and make their aquascapes truly stand out. Work together, gather the perfect hardscape elements, and unleash your best design.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aquascaping is the main activity in this game, with the primary objective of creating aquascapes with the most desired layout and composition for clients or the market. This activity is supported by various abilities within the sandbox system, such as item deployment, modification, deletion, terraforming, item snapping, and gizmo.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Similarity Valuation feature challenges players' ability to recreate stunning aquascapes with precision and attention to detail. Players are presented with reference of aquascape. Their task is to carefully examine the reference and replicate it as closely as possible. From hardscape arrangements to plant selection and positioning, every aspect must be carefully considered to achieve a high similarity score.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Client-Based Project is the first type of business model where players can earn money by completing aquascape projects at clients' homes. There are four project levels corresponding to the player's reputation: Level C, B, A, and S (Paludarium). <br/>Each level has specific characteristics, where higher levels indicate greater complexity and appeal in the expected aquascape. This business model is also effective in gaining reputation points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Market/Bidding System is the second business model that allows players the freedom to create their own dream aquascape. The completed aquascapes will be submitted to the auction mechanism and evaluated by multiple bidders based on their individual preferences, enabling players to choose the best offer they can take. This business model is very effective in generating cash.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Story &amp; Business Expansion is the player's journey in playing this game through the improvement of equipment quality and the scale of their business. In broad<br/>terms, players start their business from the cycle of searching for items in nature and building aquascapes from them. In the long run, players can establish their own cultivation system and sell aquascapes at the Paludarium level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T07:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4f4ef422bcd4b88da5d46f49341661.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 381, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bewolba Studios"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Bewolba Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
