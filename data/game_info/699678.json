Since we only had one programmer, that is actually a game designer, we decided to choose a trial and error game. We opted for a 2d game to help him out. We took the theme literally, since to finish the game you need all your characters to collaborate together. Everyone has their own special power, and everyone is necessary. We thought about weaknesses and strengths for each character, and personalities as well. We enjoyed working together in a group, it was challenging but at the same time it was very inspiring. A great experience! We will definitely keep working on the project together after the jam, because it\u2019s our baby now.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for the opportunity and for your time, hope you enjoy the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T06:55:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ac/7ac98ebacb6e11a660b91e4a18bba638.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["goateam"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
