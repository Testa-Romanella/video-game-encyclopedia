You have separate controls to move your characters in order to knock your enemies down - do so by touching the penguins with your rope. But be careful, sea urchins will appear to tear your rope and, if they do, you will lose the game. Game will also be over if you touch your enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time you hit an enemy, you will get points, and you'll get more the longer you survive.
