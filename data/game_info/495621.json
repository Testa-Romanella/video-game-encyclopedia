Within each stage, Aladdin defeats foes by jumping on them or disorienting them by throwing apples while avoiding dangerous obstacles. Gems can be collected to gain extra lives and points, and 10 red gems located within each stage will substantially increase the player&#39;s score. Most stages contain a treasure chest holding a scarab that flies about for a few seconds, if the player collects it before it disappears they will access a bonus stage in which they spin a wheel that allows Genie to grant them extra lives and other special bonuses. Aladdin has a health meter of hearts, starting with 3, which will deplete each time he is hit. These can be increased through pickups or through the bonus stages as well.</p>", "metacritic": 59, "released": "1993-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-23T19:30:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/22a/22ae4262e92461444cda9b895a5c9022.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.85, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"owned": 10, "beaten": 18, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 13, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 13, "platforms": ["SNES", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Disney Interactive Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
