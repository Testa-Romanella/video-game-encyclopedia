You play as a small fish who can interact\u00a0with other underwater creatures trying to find out more about a mysterious pipe in their home. The purpose is to stay informed and help prevent another catastrophe like\u00a0this from happening again. By playing as a fish, you not only embrace their home and insecurities, but also feel the helplessness that some humans feel when disaster strikes. </p><p>I wanted to build suspense and horror by purposefully removing or changing sounds to match our little fishie's energy. The cheery, playful, and silly commentary also plays a part in evoking emotion.</p>\n<p>Article Source: Deepwater Horizon oil spill | Summary, Effects, Cause, Clean Up, &amp; Facts | Britannica</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T20:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/926/92660b9258d50eebcde9d69f283d8f27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EternalRedXD"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
