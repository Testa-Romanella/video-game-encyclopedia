He&#39;s been split into four<br />\nKirbys of different colors, and he can call up his colorful clones to<br />\nlend a hand when needed. Summon Red, Yellow, and Green Kirby to help you<br />\nsolve puzzles, fight enemies, or take out the big baddies. Use copy<br />\nabilities such as the arrow-shooting Cupid Kirby or the melee master<br />\nSmash Kirby, while platforming through the maze-like world. Need a break<br />\nfrom the action? Try a hand at minigames such as Crackity Hack and<br />\nKirby&#39;s Wave Ride, which also star our favorite pink hero and friends!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
