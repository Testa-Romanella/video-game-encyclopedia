However, some things are better left forgotten, and a dream can quickly become a nightmare.</p>\n<p>This is a demo. If enough people are interested, I will likely continue this project. I'll probably finish it either way, but I'll put more effort and make it higher quality if a lot of people are looking forward to the finished product.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also - you may notice that there are no multiple endings at this time. In the demo, your choices\u00a0do not have a very big impact on what happens in the story.\u00a0 However, in the finished product, your choices will start to have more and more impact over time. There will be multiple endings based on these decisions and several other factors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have never made a game before and this is a pretty large project, so there might be a few errors and things like that. If you notice any, please let me know, and I will be happy to fix them!</p>\n<p>Credits are located at the end of the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T15:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e3/0e37f17232277c43e8a638a63a51e7f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["glemonss"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
