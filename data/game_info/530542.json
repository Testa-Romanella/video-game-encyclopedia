{"id": 530542, "slug": "red-rage", "name": "Red Rage", "name_original": "Red Rage", "description": "Red Rage combines a gory zombie shooter using simple, easy to master controls with a 'red only' art style. Players will fight on a variety of maps and fend off zombies to reach higher scores and in turn unlock more exciting weaponry. Zombies will attack in waves and sometimes players must be willing to fight in the dark with only a flashlight to guide them. A simple UI makes for cinematic, heart-racing gameplay with breaks only long enough for a reload.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T02:21:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb08d69bd78745afdb6382b83c9de02.jpg", "website": "https://www.snakebitestudios.co.uk", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 347, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Snakebite Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Snakebite Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
