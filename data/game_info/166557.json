Release down arrow to Ollie. Hold space while Ollieing to kick flip. Hold down arrow above rails to land on them and grind. Collect all the items in the level to progress. Smiley faces can only be captured with a kick flip.</p>\n<p>This game is very much about getting the rhythm in order to beat some of the advanced levels. The mechanic allows you to gain a good boos of speed by holding crouch (down arrow) while rolling down hill. Also this mechanic allows you to gain a great deal of speed by holding crouch (down arrow) while rolling through a group of small bumps in a row. However there is a cool down on crouching so you can not hold crouch for too long or you will slow to a stop.</p>\n<p>all up hill will slow you a bit so in some cases it will be in your best interest to try to air over the up before using it launch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcf/fcffa808b84a2aed0e1fc8b96b025a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EddyGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
