As a Spacecraft Wreckage Cleaner, you will be tasked eliminating old abandoned spaceships. These hunks of metals have been caught in orbit for years and we're the people who have to clean up the mess. Turns out the fastest way to dispose of 'em is with <strong>explosives</strong>! Make sure you plant your explosives on each of the marked spots because we can't be leaving significant chunks blasting away into space. Be careful though, the higher ups opted for the cheaper, <em>more volatile</em>, explosives last order so you gotta get away from them shortly after planting. Use the warp point to get outta there ASAP! Good luck pal.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>MSU GEL LAB for the initial project and assets</p>\n<p>@freed_will for the explosion spritesheet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:55:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bac/bac58e3780109e0cb11e531967ba7358.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Reido50"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
