Will you make it to the end?</p>\n<p>Who knows.</p>\n<p>CONCEPT:\u00a0 The dungeon consists of squares\u00a0 , which will show themselves only when the player rolls a dice on them. Depending on the field and the result of the dice, something good or something very bad may happen..\u00a0</p>\n<p>Example: If you get a high number on a\u00a0 gold field, you will be\u00a0 get more gold and more upgrades but if you for example throw a high number on a monster field, ... you probably die! Also, there are fields which\u00a0 \u00a0can yield\u00a0 \u00a0unlimited wealth or an almost safe death... making them high risk and high reward.</p>\n<p>I would love to add more diverse and interesting fields to the game (for example a boss field would be cool) but due to time constraint this wasnt really possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:29:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f939870ab4f4e8ee1c113c1443aadef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scriptorious", "HappyMaj0r", "Angelica Choi"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
