In it, you play as bob and you are trying to collect your hammers but your buddy, S.P.U.D, a well-intentioned robot that is trying its best to help you, keeps accidentally destroying your work! Try to build your way to the hammers without S.P.U.D. messing up all your work!<br/><br/>Also, there might be a weird issue with the font size, I'm trying to figure out a fix right now but I haven't figured it out yet. If any of you work with ue4 and know a solution to this then that would be very helpful. Thanks!<br/><br/>Fullscreen button may make the game easier to see and play but has weird borders that unreal engine makes that I can't get rid of for some reason.
