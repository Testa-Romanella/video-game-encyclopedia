Basically this is a prototype for a game where you play baker who finds item and fight with them. Eventually we wanted to make it so that you can combine items to create recipes that serve as more powerful attacks. Enjoy the beauty of the game and have fun playing the small bit of content we made. Right now there is no end to it but we want to develop the idea more. Feel free to leave comments on things to improve !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T14:28:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78a5821539ede790b315f1154ac545ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GGDoesDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
