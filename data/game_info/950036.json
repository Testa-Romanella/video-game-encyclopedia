Use the WASD or arrow keys to move around the map and the mouse to aim. There is unlimited dashing with the space bar right now but in future versions it will have a cool down. Right now the player health is set to 100000 and the bullet speed is set to max  for \"fun\" so good luck dying. All of the assets are free from www.Kenney.nl except the background I made myself. Please leave a comment with any feedback you have for me!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This version is to showcase the base game play loop as I work on expanding it. Next I will be adding a leveling system that will unlock new powers as you grow stronger. Stay tuned for future updates!</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/DtXJHu5A83<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>The game features\u00a0 7 tracks by White Bat Audio\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@WhiteBatAudio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T08:29:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff3a03e8256a5bcd3ded5bcc35c15ca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZeroTravesty"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
