It sat on a hard drive for over a decade other than the few beta releases that were floating around in 2019 for testing. Development and funding for HBOWK was halted in 2012, so we are releasing it to the public for preservation purposes and instead of having multiple years of work sit on a hard drive for another 12 years.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>This game is 2011 framework and has not been built upon since 2011. It has unfinished stuff, minor movement issues and dated A.I. We wanted to update this, but looking at the calendar we realize it's 12 years later and we probably will never reschedule development time on this project again. In 2016 it underwent a pretty big graphical update in hopes to be rereleased, which was shattered by the release of DOOM 2016 the same year. With that said, this beta is now available after 12 years of darkness, playable from start all the way to the end credits. It's all the original stuff, beta code, framework, and media is unchanged.<br/><br/>Many have died trying to reach <strong>Morbis</strong> high in his castle, will you be next?<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T02:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45fc9f89f757b734e032b6591ff5cd94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 452, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alien Cyber Coat"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Alien Cyber Coat"], "esrb_rating": null}
