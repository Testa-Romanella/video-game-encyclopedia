If you cannot return them to the middle portal, you will not lose as these boxes are designed to be a bonus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>YELLOW BOXES will move even faster and give you +100 points. As with the green boxes, the yellow ones will also not cause you to lose if they reach the end of the screen.</p>\n<p>There was sadly no more time left, so we were not able to add audio to the game, but we will continue to update an fix the game even after this game jam and hopefully release it on both mobile and pc!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Have fun and\u00a0make sure the boxes are not out of control!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb8509628458f88b4168e5b5d739573.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Evepto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
