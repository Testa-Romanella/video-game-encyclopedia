This game came from my own burning desire to powerloop a serpinsky triangle. It was so cool, I couldn't keep it to myself. \u00a0So now you too can power-loop and matty-filp abstract geometry from another dimension to your hearts content!\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The fractal rendering is quite intensive on the computers CPU.\u00a0 Therefore, your GPU will have little effect on the performance. If the project gains enough support, I will make a version with GPU acceleration. <br/></p>\n<p>Recommended Specs: i7, 980m, 8gb ram</p>\n<p>CONTROLLER REQUIRED!!!</p>\n<p>This game is a FPV drone simulator and requires a radio or controller to play. Any radio running open TX will work as long as you have at least two switches set up along with your gimbals. <br/></p><p>If you have questions or feedback I'd love to hear them! <br/>Discord: https://discord.gg/zH7dxQ2xQr<br/>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0qszyJuI_xhBuL0XQKTPQ<br/>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/guthixx520/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T10:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dd/4dd8def2657f945d5bb7ff055b68ef1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zachary.Londres"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
