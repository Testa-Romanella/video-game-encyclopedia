This ancient law has been successfully enacted by the Calcium Order for millennia. Until now. A strange serpentine creature refused, took hold of an island, and has been repelling the Order's agents rather successfully.<br/><br/>You have been summoned and contracted by the Order to solve the problem. You take your scythe and get on a boat.<br/><br/><ul><li>A game that takes inspiration from fast-paced FPS classics from the '90s, but moves from there in its own slightly weird direction.<br/></li><li>Fight through over 20 levels climbing the island's mountain to get to the lair of your contract target.<br/></li><li>You have the unique weapons of the Calcium Order at your disposal. You'll find them somewhat familiar yet a bit otherworldly in form and function.<br/></li><li>Learn your enemies' behaviors and use that knowledge in your deadly dance. Be warned, as some enemies can manipulate others to throw you off guard.<br/></li><li>Mistakes happen. You can conveniently rewind time to any earlier point of the level or just jump back to a few seconds before your death.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T02:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9a/a9aa91e52814ce7fcf1f808ed87bd532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Igor Aleksandrowicz"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Igor Aleksandrowicz"], "esrb_rating": null}
