For Linux (untested), just extract the zip file and run AlienInvaders.x86_64 or AlienInvaders.x86 file on your Linux machine. If you are having any issues, just do comment below, but the online HTML5 version should probably work in each desktop system having a GUI interface :)</em></strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Thanks everyone for playing! :)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T04:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbe/bbe119b16f620c58e50ecd8f135f4477.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["vaibhavkr"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
