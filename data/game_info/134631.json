The goal of the game is to shoot down all of the Hebrew vowels with the correct English sound, and to be as accurate as possible to get a high score. This game isn't very polished, but functionally it's all there. In the downloads I have included a text file with the source code for this game in case anyone wants to explore it (it's the txt file).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a3/4a3aa926b407a24d5ad0f7c6eaf53ef8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zachary Goldsmith"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
