What's bigger than the emotions a person can have while going through a break-up? What's the most anticipated moment in a Hack&amp;Slash game if not a boss fight? So that's what we did, a boss fight where the players have to face Despair!\r\nPlay as Liam and fight his negative emotions!\r\n</p>\r\nThe Plot\r\n<p>Following a sudden unexpected breakup with his long term partner, Liam, 28, finds himself lost in his own mind, battling his inner demons. Each emotion he feels, guilt, regret, anger and sadness continuously amplify every time he finds himself failing to subdue them. Armed with his violin, his only solace, he plays through Despair.\r\n</p>\r\nThe Controls\r\n<p>Movement: 'W/A/S/D' or the directional arrows;\r\nDodge Roll: 'Movement key' + 'Spacebar'\r\nAttack: 'Left Mouse Button'\r\n</p>\r\nThe Creators\r\nArt\r\n<p>DrPumpkins\r\nStyxcolor\r\n</p>\r\nAudio\r\n<p>adriikko\r\n</p>\r\nCode\r\n<p>semsem9000\r\n</p>\r\nGame Design\r\n<p>LehanDesigns\r\n</p>\r\nWriting\r\n<p>KhairikaSinani\r\n</p>\r\nExternal Assets\r\n<p>Death-ray:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/laser-effect-sheet\u00a0\r\nDespair poem by Anne Sexton:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/despair-7/\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Dialogue sheet music:\u00a0https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/never-gonna-give-you-up-chorus-only-a-rick-...\r\n</p><p>Due to a lot of people appreciating the soundtracks we wanted to share the link to the playlist on youtube:\u00a0https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUXyh98pH8yOV0oXN_M0d2nz4cyjDgIND</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T10:07:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c645c1e4364ddc630e9f06c7f2d0fe6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DrPumpkins", "LehanDesigns", "semsem9000", "KhairikaSinani", "Styxcolor", "adriikko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
