Well wonder no more... I mean, we can give you a very minimal taste of the job. You won't even be confined to the limited vision from an actual signal box!</p>\n<p><strong>Set the points and clear the correct signals</strong> to let trains in and out of the station. You will need to be quick to keep up - this place gets pretty busy! During peak hours, a train leaves this station every 10 seconds!</p>\n<p>Click on a direction on track points to switch to it. Click and drag on a semaphore to set the signal to \"clear\" and let the train go. You won't be able to clear the signal if the path ahead is occupied, but be careful! Accidentally clearing the wrong signal can mess things up!</p>\n<p>Move the camera with WASD or \u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192, rotate with right or middle mouse button, zoom with mouse wheel or -/=.</p>\r\nA Ludum Dare 51 game by The Hyperatlantic\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ryan '666Savior' White</strong> (itch.io) (twitch) - 3D art, map design</li>\n<li><strong>Kiyomi</strong> (twitter) - 2D art, textures, environment design</li>\n<li><strong>Iwo 'Outfrost' Bujkiewicz</strong> (itch.io) (twitch) - programming, game design</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ludum Dare submission page</strong><br/>The jam theme was \"Every 10 seconds\".</p>\n<p>Join our Discord server</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:09:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9d6e3d568f4e7625d560f764f016167.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Outfrost"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
