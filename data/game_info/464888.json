They need to be shot 3 times before they are fully destroyed (damage is indicated visually by the damage on the statue). Each statue gives 10 points, and after 100 points are reached the planet shrinks a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Continue to destroy the statues until the planet is at its smallest. After destroying all statues on the tiny planet, the game is won.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, beware of your own projectiles! They travel around the planet, entering orbit the moment you shoot. If you're not careful, they will be your demise. The smaller the planet, the harder it is to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022 Shoot <strong>10 statues</strong> (each <strong>3 times</strong>) to <strong>shrink the planet</strong> a little</p>\n<p>\u2022 When all <strong>10 statues</strong> are <strong>destroyed</strong> and the planet is at it's <strong>smallest</strong>, the game is <strong>won</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u2022<strong> Avoid</strong> your <strong>bullets</strong> as they orbit the planet, <strong>they hurt</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 Move = W,A,S,D</p>\n<p>\u2022 Aim = From player to mouse cursor</p>\n<p>\u2022 Shoot = Space</p>\n<p>\u2022 Mute music = M</p>\n\n<p><strong>LORE</strong></p>\n<p>You are a tank on a tiny planet shooting statues.
