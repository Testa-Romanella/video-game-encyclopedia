Are you looking for a lighthearted, jolly game that still keeps \r\nyou on your toes against AI or your friends? Do you like \"risky\" \r\nturn-based strategy games, yet want to try a unique taste? You are in \r\nthe right place, Commander!</p><p>In\r\n this turn-based game, each players are robotic factions those inhabit \r\non a hexagonal world. Your purpose is to capture all the hexagons, \r\ncleaning your foes from the map. The more hexagons you possess, the more\r\n troops you gain each turn. The most important element in Robonomy is \r\nthe level of the hexagons (1 to 3), represented by stars. They determine\r\n how many troops you'll gain from that hexagon. So yeah, you should \r\nfocus on capturing the valuable regions!</p><p>Robonomy\r\n has a toonish, lighthearted art style with colors of a rainbow, making \r\nit different from most of the other world-domination strategy games with\r\n dark, militaristic tones. But don't let this cartoonish <em>mise en sc\u00e8ne </em>\r\n deceive you to think that this is a game merely for kids. We, as \r\nplayers of strategy games, wanted to make a challenging game even the \r\nhardcore players would enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861d4e4ae8053a81936689b7a9e4e2c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ahmet Kamil Kele\u015f"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
