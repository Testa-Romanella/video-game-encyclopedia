{"id": 140735, "slug": "rising-tide", "name": "Rising Tide", "name_original": "Rising Tide", "description": "<p>Game for Ludum Dare 42 on the theme Running Out of Space.</p>\n<p>Take charge of a small Island just as sea levels start to rise in earnest. It is a race against time to complete researching a solution to the rising tides as you build up an industrial base to support your research knowing that each factory you build is only increasing the rate that the seas rise. House your people knowing that the areas that they live will soon be underwater.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move the camera and find more building sides on the island. Click on areas to build a building, but watch out, the higher up the island you build the higher the land prices will be. Complete 100 units of research to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game made in 48 hours (Really quite a lot less, I put in almost no time on Saturday) using only Unity and MS Paint. I added sounds that I got from FreeSound.org at the last minute to make the game less silent, but did not make them myself.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf37e8619a524cba37d24d62d12693d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["smilewood"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
