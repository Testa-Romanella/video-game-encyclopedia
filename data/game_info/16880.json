Players will hunt different fish species and face the difficulties of breath-holding spearfishing, an ancient fishing method. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlayers will also have to find treasures and get the possibility to take underwater photos to capture the beauty of the simulated, detailed and lively underwater worlds they\u2019re exploring also in a exploration mode. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpearfishing and Underwater Hunting are ancient fishing and hunting methods, used to catch fish by using a mechanical harpoon. Today, spearfishing is a sports activity in many countries around the world, especially in the UK, around the Mediterranean Sea and in South America. Spearfishers hunt while diving apnea, holding their breath, so have to coordinate their energy carefully while monitoring their prey, especially in tactically challenging hunting situations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:32:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f78/f78c3f5c2198605055531836e8536adb.jpg", "website": "http://www.speargame.com", "rating": 2.14, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 14, "owned": 473, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 4}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 17, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Biart Company"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Biart Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
