Attack left! Attack down!\"</em>) from your spirit guide that will increase/decrease your rage if obeyed or disobeyed. <br/></p>\n<p>Beware: only while you are in a trance are you capable of using abilities, summoning help, and attacking foes.</p>\n<ul><li>You begin raging when there are at least 4 foes directly adjacent to you, and instantly stop when no more foes are directly adjacent.</li><li>At 5 rage, you regenerate health each time you deal damage. (Note: attacking non-living foes, such as emberlings, will NOT heal you.)</li><li>At 15 rage, you must activate one ability, if you possess any.</li><li>At 20 rage, your spirit guide will summon one angel to assist you, and your rage will reset to 5. The angel will become hostile if you stop raging.</li><li>Each time you obey a command, your rage goes up by 1; each time you ignore a command, it goes down by 2.</li><li>You are granted a single (random) ability after slaying 10 foes, and then granted more after slaying 15-20 more.</li></ul>\n<p>Because always following commands will result in a quick death (from getting surrounded and then not regenerating health rapidly enough from your attacks), you should creatively balance out both stats to ensure you end fights with net positive health.</p>\n<p>Some tips:</p>\n<ul><li>Corners and walls are highly useful to ensure you only have 3-5 foes attacking you at once.</li><li>You won't stop raging if there are fewer than 4 foes adjacent to you, so beginning a rage while surrounded and then immediately moving into a corner is a great tactic.</li><li>Treat all ranged attackers (arbalists and hostile angels) as an emergency.</li><li>Remember that you can push past enemies while not in a rage.</li><li>Once you've reached the Armory, find the stairs to the deeper caves  which will be guarded by a group of very dangerous enemies. There you  will find the fiery chasm. (If you're not sure what to do at that point,  just try bumping into the fiery chasm tile.)</li><li>Be kind, this was made in 7 days :P</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T12:16:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc6/fc6aaaeacecb1a69fa4e29d39e2369cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Ki\u00ebd Llaentenn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
