We are not developing a full game out of it, but you can enjoy one level with estimated 30 minutes of playtime and replayability in this short but sweet prototype!</strong><br/><br/>Starship Saboteur Prototype is a topdown action game prototype which you can play lethally or in full stealth. Shoot or sneak your way through a starship filled with enemy patrols, things to sabotage and captains to hurl out of windows into the cold depth of space.<br/><br/>In Starship Saboteur Prototype, you sneak onto spaceships and break everything to stop an intergalactic war between three factions. This level is set aboard the Magellan, a huge Celestial Collective starship. Try out multiple playstyles, including knocking out the captain nonlethally or breaking into the armory to cause carnage. You can even cause an enemy invasion to the ship if you disable the shields and let the enemy faction take out the objectives for you!<br/><br/>Starship Saboteur Prototype was made in just 16 weeks. It contains a single level of the game with both stealth and run'n'gun playstyles. Combining action, stealth and twin stick shooting, the prototype of Starship Saboteur is our experiment on whether you can get RPG-like choices and consequences in a topdown game. While we chose not to pursue its development further, leave a comment in our forums with your ideas and how you liked the experience.<h3>Features</h3><ul><li> \ud83d\udd36 Sneak aboard the Magellan, a huge starship full of things to sabotage!<br/></li><li> \ud83d\udc41\u200d\ud83d\udde8 Play your way!
