I'm Martin, and it's my second time submitting a game for the TriJam! I still use this pretext to learn to use Godot engine and practice pixel art. This time, I also tried to make some sounds! It's basic, but I'm happy with the result. Next step might be music, but making a good soundtrack in 3 hours while also making a game in parallel seems super hard.</p>\n<p>The development time was 3 hours, and the time to make the assets and the sounds was 3 hours too. So 6 hours in total.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>\r\nPre-made assets\r\n<p>Font: https://www.dafont.com/minecraftia.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T04:36:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbb/bbbb2ecbf4f1a6f58efffa47014ba534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MartinCirice"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
