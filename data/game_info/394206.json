The sunset is a reflection of the player's life, so the player will die when it gets dark.<br/></p>\n<p>The story of the game is based on an adaptation of a Mexican children's story about the explanation of the creation of the sun, so we mixed the story with the concept of \"down to earth\", literally, to explain the end of the sun.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Once upon a time the most powerful, who lived in heaven, gathered to snatch the sun from the earth, a star that together with the moon they gave some years ago to illuminate the earth and protect it from the darkness, but these days are over now.<br/>The legend said that the last sunset will come when the shadows come down to the earth. That will bring the return to the times of darkness, where it will always be night and there will no longer be space for life on Earth anymore. \"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T04:58:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/012/0122c5b1038c0b9828cc34aa500b1a74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["faiguago"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
