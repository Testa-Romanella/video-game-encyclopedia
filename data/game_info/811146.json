Honestly there's not much else.</p>\n<p>Think of it as a turn-based version of like FOOTSIES\u00a0where you have to pre-plan your actions in advance.</p>\n<p>The AI is generally quite predictable (but not completely stupid) so keep an eye out for their patterns, if you know what your opponent is going to do, you can always stop it, even against much more powerful foes!!</p>\n<p>The game was a semi-successful prototype for another project I'm doing, rambling story below!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alright, story time!!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is a small prototype I made a while back, according to windows I last made a change to it on the 14th of October 2020.</p>\n<p>The prototype was actually one of a much longer list of prototypes that I been working on (on and off) since about mid-way through 2020 (I started as soon as I finished my first uni semester that year), this one was the most successful and most different of the prototypes (the others are very much not worth playing).</p>\n<p>The goal of these prototypes was essentially to create a <strong>fully</strong> turn-based combat system that resembles a fighting game, is able to have RPG-like elements included within it (such as stats, leveling and all that),\u00a0 avoid being fully deterministic (as in, being able to 100% ensure the winner of a fight just from seeing their stats beforehand) while\u00a0having little to no RNG elements, be easily accessible and be enjoyable/rewarding to play against both AI based opponents and other players.</p>\n<p>While I think this combat system in this prototype is fun and neat, it doesn't meet my stupid requirements for the combat system I needed for this particular game, though I am still using parts of it in future prototypes.</p>\n<p>Earlier today I realized I never actually posted it anywhere, so I wanted make it public in some form in-case someone somewhere is able to find some enjoyment or inspiration from the project (also I like documenting things I make, and it felt wrong not having this up so I do like it quite a bit)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Versions!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The zip features 2 different versions of the game one with tips, one without, I tried originally designing the game to be played with <strong><em>zero text-based tutorials</em></strong>, but I ended up with mixed results, especially since it's such an unintuitive game to play, so I added a few lil' tips that\u00a0<em>should</em> give you everything you need to know, uhhhh if you get stuck just like, idk DM me on discord if you really want to play it but are struggling <em>(Aqua#2930)\u00a0</em>or if you just have anything else you want to say/ask.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Click - Click</em></p>\n<p><em>Alt F4 - Close Game (if you downloaded it)</em></p>\n\n<p>(Side note: game was built for 1920x1080 because I didn't know how to use unity's UI stuff super well when I made it, I <em>should</em> work ok in most resolutions, but it might have a few issues,\u00a0I <em>would</em> fix it, but I didn't make anything a prefab and it's stretched across 10 scenes, so... sorry...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T09:26:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/836/836ed3bbef3e25a7440b47d5d39c2730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tim David"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
