It is your task to take out their relays sending leaked nudes to Mayor McRonald. The relays are guarded by some of the Some Bad Boys, so take them out while you are there. They are located in the top of those buildings that you can walk into and climb. Those tower looking thingy's that fall down and float away are not the droids you are looking for. You aren't even looking for droids you are looking for relays, don't get so distracted.<br/></p>\n<p>Be careful not to hit civilians because they make some annoying ass sounds that you can't turn off but the bullets bounce around so it is kinda hard to avoid and then they run into things and get scared and scream some more. Not great people not sure why I want to help them.<br/></p>\n<p>Also traffic is kinda bad here so destroy cars if you can. They are my only escape driving crazy anyway.</p>\n<p>Also beware that the leader of Some Bad Boys doesn't show up but if he does, just shoot at him while you play his little game.<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to Look Around</p>\n<p>Shift to run</p>\n<p>Space to jump</p>\n<p>Click to Shoot</p>\n<p>C to advance text</p>\n<p>E to interact with the 2 objects you can interact with<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the 'So Bad It's Good' game jam!</p>\n<p>Audio sample from Kirin J Callinan - Big Enough</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dee/dee6a31aaaf7d2aab6b8b7c047de4699.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NickTheSic"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
