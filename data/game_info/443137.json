Set in an ancient mythical Greek world of Gods and Monsters, you play as a man, a sinner, a heretic, banished deep within Tartarus by the corrupted Pantheon that fears you. The game is currently in the alpha-demo stage of development.\r\n</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the game in our IndieDB Development Logs.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Currently Implemented Features in the Demo\u00a0:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Procedural Dungeons</strong></p>\n<p>You are trapped deep inside Tartarus, the Pantheon has chosen to banish you inside the sunken city of Minos, once a lavish labyrinthine palace, now corrupted and ravaged by the Hellspawn of Tartarus. There will be further locations the player can explore in later and final versions of the game (Note: this is just a demo).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Combat</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A Classic DOOM-esque spellcasting system is implemented as part of the core experience within Undaunted. You will start with a simple makeshift Staff, but as you progress through the game you will find more powerful ranged weapons that provide greater variety in combat, and a rusty but trusted blade to hack your enemies down when your Mana reserves run low.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loot</strong></p>\n<p>You can loot various precious objects scattered around the Labyrinth, as it was a palace full of Gold and treasures before it sank deep beneath Tartarus. Looted objects will count as Gold, which can be used to purchase Staffs, consumables, and other useful things from the Petrified Merchants of Tartarus you encounter in game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weapons<br/></strong>Inside this demo, you will encounter 6 staffs that you can find scattered around the dungeon, but be aware, you can only carry three staffs, so sacrifice and choice needs to be made.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer! :\u00a0The publicly available version is outdated and does not represent the final quality of the game</strong></p>\n<p>- Upgrade Stats via Merchants<br/>- New Staff Model<br/>- Improved Enemy AI Behavior<br/>- New random encounter Lockdown-type room<br/></p>\n<p><strong>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li><strong>OS:</strong>\u00a0Windows 7+ (64-bit)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a02.0 Ghz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>\u00a04 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics: </strong>DX11 or above</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong>\u00a01 GB available space</li></ul>\n<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li><strong>OS:</strong>\u00a0Windows 10+ (64-bit)</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong>\u00a03.0 Ghz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong>\u00a08 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong>\u00a0DX11 or above, GTX 1050 and above is recommended</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong>\u00a02 GB available space</li></ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>\u00a0: This game is currently in Alpha Stage, expect bugs, crashes\u00a0and incomplete features.\u00a0Nothing is final and subject to change.\u00a0<strong>The\u00a0publicly available version is outdated and does not represent the final quality of the game.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>( Optional ) You can support the game through donations to\u00a0aid the development and\u00a0earn a Patron Discord Rank as well as an always first priority for updates and info regarding the game.<br/><br/>Alpha 0.0.1\u00a0Date : 06 April 2020<br/>Hotfix 0.0.1b : 07 April 2020<br/>Update 0.0.2: 11 April 2020</p>\n<p><strong>Discord :</strong></p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/CZFt74R</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T03:18:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/883c1e4cd28fcd60f7984aa641045adb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trimatraintractive"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
