In addition, the game features a combination of inhouse and outsourced assets - The Main Hub and Laboratory being almost exclusively inhouse.</p>\n<p>Overall, it has been a blast to work on and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed working on it!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Producer<br/></strong>Raven Hoegalmen\u00a0(Linkedin)</p>\n<p><strong>Art<br/></strong>Ed Swinbourne - Art rep &amp;\u00a0Environment Artist (Artstation)<br/>Thomas Moore - Prop &amp; Environment Artist\u00a0(LinkedIn)<br/>William Capewell - Prop Artist (Artstation)<br/>Stefan Suciu - Character Artist &amp; Animator (Artstation)<br/><br/><strong>Code<br/></strong>Kurtis Watson - Code Rep, Player &amp; Puzzle Mechanics\u00a0(Portfolio)<br/>Nikodem Hamrol - UI &amp; Tools\u00a0(Portfolio)<br/>Gaetano Trovato - Tools &amp; Gameplay\u00a0(LinkedIn)<br/>Michalis Stratis - Menus (LinkedIn)<br/>Saurya Saurav - AI &amp; Gameplay (Portfolio)<br/><strong><br/>Design<br/></strong>Adam Lorincz - Level &amp; Enemy Designer (Linkedin)<br/>Sema Ermis - UI Designer (Linkedin)<br/>Will Rogers - Narrative &amp; Experience Designer (Portfolio)<br/><strong><br/>Voice Acting<br/></strong>Alix Perry - Julia (Portfolio)<br/>Antonio Roulet - Clarus (StarNow)</p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks To<br/></strong>Kelvin Wong<br/>Zafar Qamar<br/>Zuby Ahmed<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T11:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df3/df395df324bd94c7e8556c9e06a55538.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Casper Hoegalmen"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
