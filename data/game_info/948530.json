It's a silly local multiplayer top-down shooter where you can pick up any object in the environment and shoot it out of your gun, no matter how ridiculous.\u00a0This is an early WIP build.

But you can see the core functionality there:<br/></p>\n<p>- Local multiplayer top-down shooter</p>\n<p>- You can pick up any object and shoot it out of your gun, no matter how ridiculous.</p>\n<p>- Some objects have to be damaged before you can pick them up.
