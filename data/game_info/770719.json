I was somewhat heavily inspired\u00a0by the Kaizo genre of platformers, and am pretty satisfied with how my item physics turned out. The puzzles don't have much meat behind them, and the physics are still kind of janky, but I'm still satisfied with it for my first ever game jam, especially considering I did this all solo and from the ground up!</p>\n<p>(Current version: 1.1)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T14:11:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/077/07753f8ed111529b0847213fd3510f5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Amalgamated Gooze"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
