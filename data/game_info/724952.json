It's your first day and you are ready to assert your dominance on your peers and show them who is da real boss in town. It's lunchtime but you are fed up, they only give you a tomato. ONE tomato. Your parents pay for such expensive tuition and the best they can serve you is one lousy tomato?!?! You feel the wrath. The heat. The frustration. Seeping through your veins and into that hot head of yours ;)\u00a0The tomato is now your greatest weapon, but it can also be your downfall. Throw your tomato across the cafeteria to show them you are not to be messed with but don't hit the pretentious school representative or your crush. She will be very sad which will make you very sad as well :(</p>\n<p><em>This game supports Xbox and Playstation Controllers</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Right Flipper: E/ Right Bumper</p>\n<p>Left Flipper: Q/ Left Bumper</p>\n<p>Plunger: Spacebar/ Right Trigger</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Rocco Wu: Designer, Engineer, UI Artist, and Audio Designer</p>\n<p>City and road 3D assets from KENNEY.NL</p>\n<p>Gigachad from knowyourmeme.com</p>\n<p>Anime images from anime-planet.com</p>\n<p>Tomato from rhcreations on sketchfab</p>\n<p>Music by James Ignacio.
