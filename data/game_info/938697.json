The game begins with a player and a zombie spawned at random positions on the screen, and the player must use the arrow keys or WASD to move around while avoiding the zombie.\r\n</p>\n<p>The player can shoot the zombie by clicking on the screen, and if successful, the zombie is killed and respawns at a new random position. The game keeps track of the number of kills and deaths, and calculates the KD ratio (kills/deaths) of the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game features a pause button that allows the player to pause the game if they need to take a break or deal with something else. The game also displays instructions on how to play and move the character.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game has a title screen that appears before the game starts, and the player must click to start the game. Once the game starts, the title screen disappears, and the player must survive as long as possible. If the zombie catches and kills the player, the game restarts, and the death count increases by one.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is written in JavaScript using the p5.js library and is playable in a web browser.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T12:34:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aaf/aaf1c2f04e18f1a430c8d48857950daf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eyes"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
