She has close friends and is part of a prominent pod, her future is all planned out. But Cordelia isn\u2019t most mermaids. When her pod moves to the coast, she\u2019s warned about the forbidden shallows and the dangers that lurk beyond. She\u2019s heard all the rumours of course, but none of her friends will go near it. Curiosity gets the better of Cordelia, and she soon finds herself trembling at the fearful lights and hum of this strange city. However, something - some<em>one</em> actually - has also caught her eye. What starts as mere curiosity blossoms into something far more interesting. Soon Cordelia questions who she really is, and what she really wants. As she ventures further into uncharted territory, she gets closer to love but further from who she is and what she knows. Will she risk it all for a taste of the forbidden?</p>\n<p>As the MC, you play Cordelia (22yrs). Cordelia is a curious mermaid, not one to meticulously follow the rules. Her eagerness and enthusiasm make her well-liked within the pod. She\u2019s easy to talk to and has a friendly casual nature that puts anyone at ease. Cordelia is frequently chosen for special tasks as she\u2019s thought to embody a mermaids\u2019 best qualities. She\u2019s well liked within the pod, and that suits her perfectly for her role as a Revelier taking care of special events and social occasions. She loves pitching in\u00a0 to help out her pod.</p>\n<p>Yet while Cordelia is thought to embody core mermaid virtues, the truth is a little more complex. Cordelia\u2019s curiosity and natural enthusiasm are part of a character trait that\u2019s not so typical of mermaids: curiosity. This inquisitiveness has gotten her into trouble before. It\u2019s not that Cordelia seeks to break rules, it\u2019s more that natural tendencies of self-restraint and reflection have somehow gone missing in her. Those who know Cordelia hardly fault her for that; her gentle personality and inquisitive nature is\u00a0part of her charm. She\u2019s an extrovert, a social butterfly that plunges headlong into everything, including her friendships. Cordelia and Idyllia, her best friend, are like two pearls in an oyster. Idyllia cares deeply for her, character flaws and all.</p>\n<p>Cordelia is an active mermaid and a strong swimmer, even by mermaid standards. She prefers a simple look, and always wears her hair down, no exceptions. There\u2019s a reason for this, but Cordelia would never allow us to spoil it for you. Like most mermaids Cordelia also has accessories she might wear from time to time.\u00a0 She prefers simple beauty, things made from natural materials.\u00a0 Cordelia is always happy to have company as she travels sound the reef - swimming alongside other aquatic life, or even allowing them to draft in her wake. She\u2019ll even carry a live passenger or two if she sees a plant or animal in need of a lift.</p>\n\n<p>Those that get to know Dunia find her very down-to-earth. She likes to take care of herself and surroundings, that includes cultivating friendships with people who share her interests. She\u2019s open and honest with those that she cares about, and expects the same in return. She doesn\u2019t have time for drama or people she doesn\u2019t feel are being genuine with her - and she won\u2019t hesitate to cut them out of her life. In terms of herself and her surroundings, she's generally neat, tidy, and well groomed. She's very environmentally conscious and likes natural materials. She also enjoys crafts, and even makes her own jewelry when the mood suits her. In her spare time she enjoys reading and practices meditation. Nature is where she really gets her energy from, that\u2019s one of the reasons she loves the ocean so much. She embraces nature in her home as well - surrounding herself with plants, and even growing a few of her own herbs that she uses to flavour her dishes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning: </strong>Content includes scenes involving gore, death, and self-harm.
