You control two ships simultaneously. Destroy the left to earn points, while recovering resources on the right to multiply those points. The left side does not take damage. The right side does. Above all you must extract with your score. Playing until death will not only wipe your score it will wipe your leaderboard position as well, yes, across all Tiers.<br/><br/>EXTRACT with your score and move on to the next Tier. You will now be able to wager part or all of your previous score, essentially creating a bucket of points that you can earn as a bonus. Choose wisely. Extracting before reaching the wager will mean the wager will become a penalty. To earn your wager you must reach it through destruction on the left.<br/><br/><br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The screen is split with the HR-D on the left side (Assault) and the DF-R on the right side (Recovery). The HR-D <strong>DOES NOT</strong> take damage while the DF-R <strong>DOES</strong>. If the DF-R is destroyed the game is over, you wipe your score, and your leaderboard position. Damage is permanent, however you do earn a bonus the lower your health is.
