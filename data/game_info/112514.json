You are isolated in a room for one month. Your goal is to survive for a full month without starving, falling into a coma, or going insane!</p><li> [GAME DESCRIPTION] \u2022</li><p>Can you survive a month without leaving your room?</p><p>Maybe you're an introvert and you don't like interacting with people on a regular basis. (Not all introverts hate interacting with people)</p><p>Maybe not even at all?</p><p>Maybe you're just enjoying the life of a hermit crab.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with that though. That's how some of us live.</p><p>Anyways uhhhh right. The game. Hmmm I don't really have anything to sell you</p><p>so uh\u2026\u2026.Okay. I got it. I'll just explain what will be happening so there's no surprise.</p><p>In this game you play the life of a programmer trying to live a healthy lifestyle. It's summer break and he's got enough unbranded triangle chips and dry ramen to last a month. Your job is to balance certain aspects of his life, such as...making sure he is eating enough, getting enough rest, and most importantly...not going insane. Not everyone can holdout in a room without suffering inside.</p><p>Maybe you have what it takes to get rid of the voices in his head. Actually, forget what I just said...</p><li> [CONTROLS &amp; HOW TO PLAY] \u2022</li><p>[Left click] either the Microwave, Laptop, or Bed to bring up actions that will alter your stats.</p><p>If ANY of your stats reach zero then it's game over. In order to win you have to keep all your stats above zero for a full month. (~30 days)</p><p>Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!</p><p>Oh! One more thing, the top option of each menu is a gamble. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't. However if you don't like randomness to be a factor I'm fairly positive that the game can be beaten without the use of randomness.</p><p>[EXTRA INFORMATION]</p><p>This game was created as part of a game jam and was completed in roughly 12 hours or so. We had a lot of fun making it and we'd like to hear what you've enjoyed and what you didn't. Feedback is feedback. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/aba0798ae7559258e238cf9844a79d08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adrian Miasik"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
