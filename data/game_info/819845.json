Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. At least when it's slow, and inertial kick can spin it into a better gear, if it doesn't send you flying into an asteroid instead. Drifting can kill the engine when needed, but the drive starts going crazy for some reason.</p>\n<p>Keyboard: WASD and arrow keys to turn. Spacebar to drift. ESQ to exit to menu.</p>\n<p>Gamepad: D-pad and left joystick supported. X (playstation) or A (xbox) to drift. Square or B to return to menu.</p>\n<p>Drifting causes the die to spin as does accelerating, crashing, or collecting a checkpoint.\u00a0 Drifting also increases turning speed.</p><p>Credits:\u00a0</p><p>Lost Attic LLC (Scott Prager, Meg Owenson)</p><p>BlueMoons (programmer, designer)</p><p>Rob Scales (music)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T20:43:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a6/3a62d34176b65c9eda9f868b92e2773e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["splinterofchaos", "BlueMoons96"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
