A little child who just wants to sit at home and play Playstation and watch\u00a0D3kryption on YouTube (shameless plug). His parents pop him into the car and tell him he's going to spend a few hours at the park. But he doesn't want that. He is persuaded into going by his father, Gerald, mentioning the danger in the park. That the evil Ork Pigman is terrorising it and not many people can help. The child is...you know a child, takes on this task himself and decides to become Sir Poop... (the child named the character) Travel the lands, stop Pigmans spawns and rescue the kingdom.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>You will spawn into a cutscene giving you the backstory then drop into the menu. From here you will start your imaginary tale. Using the mouse you can click around the map to move Sir Poop. Right-clicking on a target (or destructible item) will cause Sir Poop to attack. (note, attacking is a bit buggy, keep clicking after every strike to make him attack)<br/></p>\r\nDeveloper Comments\r\n\n<p>This was one of the biggest games I've made to date. It's also my first time in Unreal. I've used Unity 3D for nearly 10+ years. But Unreal, only 4 months! Crazy. But luckily the knowledge was quite transferable. I also developed it solely on a Linux platform. Which is nice! I loved this game. I didn't model anything, but most of the voices are created by me. So many things I'd love to keep improving on but time is up. I streamed 80% of the game development on my youtube channel (d3kryption). I hope you enjoy it. :D</p>\n\r\n What I did well\r\n<ul><li>Using Unreal for the first time. I love this engine! Can't wait to try UE5.\r\n</li><li>The gameplay is quite fun and I actually just kept playing it and enjoying it.\r\n</li><li>The graphics are incredible, but I didn't do that. So the landscape :D\r\n</li><li>I streamed most of the development\r\n</li><li>I love the backstory\r\n</li></ul>\r\nWhat I would do better next time\r\n<ul><li>Focus on ordering tasks at the level of importance. Enemy death animations are not as important as the final boss battle (I did this the last night of the jam (-_-**) )\r\n</li><li>Improve my UE knowledge. I'm still a noob, but getting far better!\r\n</li><li>Ask more people for voices. A range would be far better\r\n</li><li>Maybe start looking into the C++ side of Unreal?\r\n</li></ul>\r\nNew things I've learnt\r\n<ul><li>Unreal Engine 4. The amount of stuff I've learned this week compared to the past months is incredible. I love this engine.\r\n</li><li>Better gameplay. I have upped my gameplay from basic to pretty good now :D\r\n</li></ul>\r\nKnown bugs\r\n<ul><li>Attacking glitches. Sometimes it attacks sometimes it doesn't. Really odd glitch. Just keep clicking and it will\r\n</li><li>Sir Poop rotates when attacking barrels. It was 3 am in the morning and I couldn't figure it out lol\r\n</li><li>The enemy boss sometimes doesn't attack lol\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:50:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10a/10aa4a05e6595a8ba89bbafa19da2646.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D3kryption"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
