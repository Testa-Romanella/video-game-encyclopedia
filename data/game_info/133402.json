Void fog has invaded your land, bringing terrible creatures with it. In order to survive, you must travel through the void and activate the five light totems.</p><p><strong>THEME</strong><br/></p><p>LD40's theme was the more you have, the worse it is. In Fog Eater, the more totems you light up, the more monsters come to kill you. In addition, the more health &amp; bullets you have, monsters in the void can hear you easier and can detect your life force from further away.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD: Move</p>\n<p>Left click: Use Gun/Broom</p>\n<p>Tab: Switch weapon</p>\n<p>Left Shift: Show compass</p><p>=====================</p>\n<p>If you get stuck in a wall (I\u00a0didn't program collisions very well), you can press Backspace to get out.</p>\n<p>If you get a lot of lag from the fog, please complain about it in the comments, and I'll see what I\u00a0can do.</p><p>If you have any questions or you want to follow my future development, here's my twitter.</p><p><strong>THANKS</strong></p><p>This game\u00a0 was partly inspired by the game Earl Gray, created by JustWall.
