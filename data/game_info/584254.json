I'm really bad a pixel art, but the post processing did save the graphics, I guess ?</p>\n<p>This is my 2nd game using Unity. I used Aseprite for the assets, a bit of Photoshop, and Bfxr for the sounds. The music is royalty free, because I didn't have\u00a0 time to compose one myself, as I had to publish this game for the 6th of April. It is actually developped as a project for my post-high school college.</p>\n<p>I hope you atleast had a little bit of fun playing it, and feel free to post a comment :D</p>\n<p>This game is made by me, Loucas DAIF. If you want in any way to use some assets of that game, please ask me first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T03:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/503/503b646290f57d44cfd833a3ad081834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Patahuete"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
