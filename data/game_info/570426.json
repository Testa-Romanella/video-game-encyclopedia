If you touch an enemy, you will kill them. However if they move onto you - you will immediately die. If you run out of turns, you will also die and have to start from the beginning.<br/></p>\n<p>The main objective of the game is to collect the key in each room, as well as defeat each enemy. The more rooms you complete, the harder each room becomes! When you move to the next room, you will gain a set amount of extra turns.</p>\n<p>There are many unique map layouts, and the key and enemies will never be in the same place.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move.<br/></p>\n<p>If you want the enemies to move without using up a turn, press the space bar.</p>\n<p>Known issues:</p>\n<p>Once you complete a room, if you dont go forward into the next room and instead backtrack, you will get softlocked. You can pause the game and go back to the main menu if this occurs.</p>\n<p>Enemies may stand on top of each other.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:20:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/635aa9523e9c418c91ac958923be209c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LewisJones30"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
