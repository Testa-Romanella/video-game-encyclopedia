Choose your class and explore an old-school dungeon filled with treasure, traps, and monsters.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Can be played in-browser or downloaded for Windows or Mac. Supports keyboard and gamepad.</p>\n<p>*This is a demo. I plan to add a few more levels and features in the future, and a bit more polish. I'm an\u00a0indie dev and only make games in my spare time so I don't really have a timeline for future updates. Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>**Cover image by spearheart0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/732f5b223cab32708e408694de798267.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["gamedevlibrarian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
