Don't forget to <strong>sneak away from enemies</strong>, and<strong> sneak up on prey</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>What you can eat:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Birds</strong>: difficult to approach without startling, but worth the <strong>most points</strong> when pounced upon.</li><li><strong>Bird eggs</strong>: they won't even see you coming.</li><li><strong>Stray campers</strong>: will run away unless you're <em>very </em>quiet, but they're<strong> pretty out of shape</strong>.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>What you can't eat:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Spear traps</strong>: must be<strong> carefully</strong> jumped over. Watch out for prickly bits.</li><li><strong>Wolves</strong>: fast and dangerous, but can't see anything <strong>below their own noses</strong>. Sneak until they're out of sight.</li></ul>\n<p>At a score of <strong>200,\u00a0</strong>you level up! With increased <strong>speed </strong>and <strong>jumping </strong>ability, you can snap birds out of the air, and soar backwards over charging wolves.</p>\n<p>May require\u00a0Chrome to play properly in-browser.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Up Arrow</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Left/Right Arrows</strong> - Speed up and slow down</p>\n<p><strong>Down Arrow\u00a0</strong>- Sneak!</p>\n<p><strong>Click </strong>to start or restart the game</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Ben Codrington - Design, code, art, and sound, done in that order.</p>\n<p>Written with the Phaser game framework.\u00a0Music done in\u00a0Bosca Ceoil.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a72/a72917fe87020992c03ac8fd8b5f9c5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ProjectBench"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
