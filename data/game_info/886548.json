It consists of dialogue-focused cutscenes and gameplay-focused battle scenes, and is about an hour long.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is also the first game I've made that's heavily driven by story, and the second game ever that I've started working on. Like it's characters, it's been through quite a journey as it was developed.</p>\n\r\nReport bugs!\r\n<p>This is an open beta, and there are many bugs. If you see literally\u00a0<em>anything</em>\u00a0weird, even if you aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s a bug at all, or if you just have some feedback you want to share, please send me a response with this Google Form. It only takes a couple minutes and I\u2019d appreciate it immensely.</p>\n<p>If the game crashes or freezes, you can fill out a bug report and then\u00a0try reloading the game to see if it was a one-time thing.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Controls</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys = Move/Select</li><li>Enter/Space = Confirm/Dialogue</li><li>K/Z = Attack</li><li>L/X = Heal</li><li>Esc/P = Pause (but Esc will also exit fullscreen)</li><li>Back = Exit</li></ul>\n<p>Score</p>\n<ul><li>Score is increased for every monster and boss defeated, by different amounts depending on the monster</li><li>Score is decreased for every soldier defeated, by different amounts depending on the soldier</li><li>Score is increased by 1 every time a soldier is healed</li><li>Score is increased by 1 every time a monster takes damage from the player or from being on fire</li></ul>\n\r\nSaving\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you see this icon, your current save point is set and permanently unlocked.

You can find the full bug list and changelog\u00a0here.</p>\n<ul><li>The behavior of soldiers/monsters can sometimes be buggy; for example, they may not move around obstacles or other characters correctly. That's why it\u2019s your job as the player to help them, but if you see someone do something weird I\u2019d still appreciate a bug report.</li><li>The dragon sprite and the map are both outdated/unfinished; the dragon's neck visually breaks when she leans forward because she can lean farther now than she could since the sprite was made</li></ul>\n\r\nLatest Version\r\n<p>v0.4.1 Beta\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Fixed a bug where the game would still crash if a skeleton took damage while spawning\r\n</li><li>Moved the dialogue box to the top of the screen in the forest battle, so the assassin can be seen shushing Dmitri\r\n</li><li>The assassin now turns back to the trees when Quintavius investigates them</li></ul>\n\r\nSpecial thanks to these beta testers\r\n<ul><li>Bakedbeanenthusiast</li><li>Boltzter\r\n</li><li>CyberXtronic\r\n</li><li>jazz_horse</li><li>Vaskhar</li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you for playing my game.
