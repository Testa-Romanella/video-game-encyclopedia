The theme was Less is More.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play as a hero in his quest to free the world of the Hell Boars. Sadly, even though the sword you begin with looks cool, it's not that sharp, and has no magic whatsoever. Find a better weapon, be it one that looks unimpressive!</p>\n<p>My goal for this jam was to do everything myself. And that's what I did! Took me a lot of time to make those sprites. The music is the only thing imported.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:22:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8a/b8a065f9e9270d2022336b6fbd35957b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Remus1453"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
