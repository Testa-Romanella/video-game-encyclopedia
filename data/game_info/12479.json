A never ending demand for more lives and resources. The Year is 2436, and humanity, once again, wages war on itself. Nearly a hundred years ago we settled on the Sirius Star System, a rich system with two habitable planets. The first Settlers, now forming the Sirius Colonial Council built this ecology from the ground up. They self-governed and prospered. Five years ago, the Terrans appeared, demanding to return the Control over the System. Failure to do so would result in catastrophic response from the Terran Reclaim Forces.<br/><br/>And so, once again, war erupts. <br/><br/>Take part of the war or live along both sides, trade, fight, think and explore.

One day, the Research Station from the Sociecty of Advanced Technology, a neutral Faction dedicated to research the effects of AGI, vanished. Well... in an explosion. From that day on ships of unknown origin invaded, attacked traders, attacked explorers, abducted people. Always leaving only fragments of data. Fragments that say \"...remember the Crimson Dawn\". We never gave them much thought. Another Lunatic, fallen to space sickness, painted his ship in odd colors, attempting to kill people until stopped.<br/><br/>It was too late to realize that these were not loners. That these were not unorganized. That these seek to end all human life in this star system.

To end us.Features<ul><li> Explore an 11AU big Star System, with a living economy and hidden riches<br/></li><li> Take your Side in an Endless war between the SCC and the TRF.
