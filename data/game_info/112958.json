This is what I managed to accomplish.</p><p>Blimpo Warrior is an RPG of sorts, but instead of random battles, there are mini-games. Gain stats and money by doing mini-games. Battle with mini-games. Everything is a mini-game.</p><p>STORY: You are the legendary Blimpo Slayer. The king has hired a new hero anyway. Find the hero and.. take his place? Then defeat the Blimpo Lord.<br/></p><p>I stopped working on this when I got a real job back in 2006. </p><p>It's not professional. It's not polished. It's buggy. The game might crash all the time. The game has a resolution of 320x200 for some <em>raisin</em>. <em><strong>DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!</strong></em></p><p>I'm only putting this up because this work of beauty has to be experienced. It might not be for you. Get a \"let's player\" to play it.</p><p>The game contains midis not made by me. Some other sounds are also not made by me. Everything else was me. Engine: Multimedia Fusion 1.5<br/></p><p>It's also the <strong>best game of all time</strong> and you'll know it once you play it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d5fc4efd0283ea002cc6e2199035527.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spram"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
