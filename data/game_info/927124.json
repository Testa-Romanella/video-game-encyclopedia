{"id": 927124, "slug": "terra-beta", "name": "Terra Beta", "name_original": "Terra Beta", "description": "<p>\u00a0In its own cannon, Terra Beta is a God simulator designed by a higher entity to test the capabilities of the creatures from the world it has created (aka the player.) It offers players a set of parameters from which to build a world, then takes them on a journey through the world they have created. Within the game, these journeys are intended to explore the ethical, technical, and existential challenges of each possible world. Choice not only determines which world a player winds up with, but the very way they are able to interact with both the world, and the game itself. There are ways to play that uncover easer eggs and hidden fourth wall breaks, there are ways to play that are driven by story and characters met along the way, and there\u2019s a way to play that follows the idea of the derive: letting the act of meandering through choices lead you where it may. Choosing to be kind, curious, and reasonable will produce a very different experience than choosing chaos, but for the most part, neither is categorized by the game as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d other than in a few moments where a narrator, speaking through the game, pops up to reprimand you. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>All images generated in Dream by WOMBO.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Instructions: \u00a0Use system settings to assign a level (1-3, ranging from weakest to strongest) to each of the four variables. \u00a0Combine levels of variables based on imagined planet outcome, (IE to make a water world, set water to three for no land masses) Once all variables have been assigned, click the coordinating list of numbers in the Terra Viewer. (If the combination of numbers you\u2019ve selected aren\u2019t there, it hasn\u2019t been added yet. This is still a prototype. Pick the closest combination you can.)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T11:27:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/708/708e740b0f47a76593980242ccca462e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["corncobular"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
