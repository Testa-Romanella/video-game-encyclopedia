Lead \n      your platoon through an onslaught of commandos, voodoo warriors, \n      dangerous guerillas, and that's just the beginning! When the action gets \n      too intense to manage by yourself, hook up with a friend in multiplayer \n      to battle your way through the bullets! While the game\u2019s chief focus is \n      intense and fun action, the multiple weapons, upgradeable equipment, and \n      the destructible environment further enrich the experience.\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/172/1724e755863bcb083acfa9a54392abed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 327, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Subdued Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
