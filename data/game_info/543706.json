However, as soon as you swing your sword at the dragon, it shatters. Turns out you have drastically overestimated your skills and your gear's quality. Quick! You must flee this dungeon and find the exit. Grab items along the way to better your chances in the encounters you will face. Whether you are mauled by a t-rex, get crushed by an anvil, or get crushed in a bear hug, this will surely be: A Knight to Remember.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game was initially made in a Game Design class in the Fall of 2019 and was polished up shortly after. While it isn't very large in scope we still think it is an enjoyable experience and hope you think so as well!</p>\n<p>Developers:</p>\n<p>Zachary Maizes: Producer, Main Programmer, Designer</p>\n<p>Jacob Pine: Programmer, Artist, Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:20:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/076/076e6490fcab6b97bb60750e5b1f970c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jpinedev", "Zachary"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
