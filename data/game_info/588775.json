Maybe I'll update the game in the future once I'm more experienced.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T07:45:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b87/b875eeac1d3d2c5ceac9772cace4825a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Red_Lettuce"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
