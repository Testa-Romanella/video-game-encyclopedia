{"id": 169337, "slug": "kickboxing-manager", "name": "Kickboxing Manager", "name_original": "Kickboxing Manager", "description": "<p>A sports management game in the vein of Football Manager, or Out Of The Park Baseball. Recruit, train and manage a stable of fighters as you try to prepare them for matches. For those who aren't familiar with kickboxing, try searching online for K-1 to get a feel for the sport this game is about. Or you can try searching up fighters such as Masato, Buakaw Por Pramuk, Peter Aerts and Remy Bonjasky.</p><p>The full game is free. To play it, simply unzip the downloadable zip file and run the exe. I'm releasing it here as sort of a demo to its spiritual sequel, World Boxing Manager, which is currently available on Greenlight. If you like this game, please feel free to upvote World Boxing Manager for an even better experience!</p><p>Link to the Greenlight page for World Boxing Manager:</p><p>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767821754<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81c/81c66545aeac999e84b15204fcb23991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aggroblakh"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
