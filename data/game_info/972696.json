Unlimited ammo, but isn't automatic.<br/><br/>Machine Gun:<br/>An easy-to-use weapon for its automatic firing. High ammo capacity.<br/><br/>Shotgun:<br/>Best used in close quarters. Lacks automatic fire and range, but its spread can hit targets both above and below you.<br/><br/>Grenade Launcher:<br/>Only fires single shots and has a low ammo capacity, but its explosions can take out multiple targets.<br/><br/>Hand Grenade:<br/>Like the grenade launcher, its explosions are able to dispatch many targets in one go.<br/><br/>Medkits:<br/>Will fully recover your health when picked up.<h3>The Nude State</h3>If your health drops below half, you will enter the 'nude state'. Be careful! In this state, enemies will try to violate her if they get too close!<h3>Pregnancy and Egg Laying</h3>There are certain enemies that you may come into contact with while in the nude state that will lay eggs in you,<br/>causing you to go into the 'Pregnant' state. If certain conditions are met while in the pregnant state, you will<br/>end up laying eggs.<br/><br/>If your health drops to zero while in the pregnant state, you will respawn with the state cured. If you want to see<br/>an egg-laying scene, you should find a medkit as soon as you can.
