To make it through this batty world, it's going to take skill, courage, and a whole toolkit of gadgets and gizmos. Glide with your space-age bat wings, use your hyper-sonic bat screech to shatter objects, and send sparks flying with your electrified inline skates! <br/></p>\n<p>We want this game to feel great to play. We want newcomers to grasp it quickly and for experts to get rewarded for their skill.
