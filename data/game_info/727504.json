{"id": 727504, "slug": "chig-tag", "name": "Chig Tag", "name_original": "Chig Tag", "description": "<p>Chig Tag is an action RPG in which combat is replaced by freeze-tag contests. Freezers need to freeze all their opponents in the allotted time. Melters need to melt their teammates and dodge freeze attempts to keep the freezers from winning before time runs out.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game requires gamepads and can be played with one to four players cooperatively on the same system. Press start on a connected gamepad to join or exit the game.<br/></p>\n<p>Skills improve with experience and rest, so your characters get better at the skills you have them use most. The skills include running, balancing (instead of falling), freezing, and dodging. Falling occurs when running and suddenly changing directions without enough balance skill. Dodging requires anticipating your opponent's freeze attempt and using the dodge skill before the opponent uses the freeze skill. Using any skill, except successfully balancing, expends energy, which can be regained with rest. Rest can be gained at the designated resting area.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is intended for audiences aged 8 and up.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T04:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08f/08fe12add3f1b11a2bd0740b4e2b61b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yethwhinger"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
