This time i tried something less serious and time consuming, but creating it was just as fun as the first game :) .\u00a0You can play it online with friends and the main goal is to collect 5 ps4s. Why? well.. you will not understand anyways.. Graphics are ps1 style and the gameplay is slender-like.\u00a0My only advice is to stay on the road and... remember that... you are not alone</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>The game was made in unity, i havent included any screenshot to avoid spoilers<br/>hope you'll have fun playing it :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T15:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f86/f868536a21043c0e341ebe89d88919bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Acquah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
