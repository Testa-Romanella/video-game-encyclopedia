This game is meant to be played like it\u2019s 1995 again \u2014 no loot boxes, no battle passes, no grinding and paying to win. It\u2019s only your skills that matter when it comes to Toad\u2019s survival and total Toad Domination!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnique protagonist: trigger-happy Toad!<br/>\r\nRetro twin-stick shooter mechanics: just like 20 years ago.<br/>\r\nEasy to catch the flow: nothing to get you distracted from Toadpocalypse.<br/>\r\nDynamic soundtrack: enough to make you wish to smash more rebels.<br/>\r\nLarge variety of uncommon, odd and unique weapons to keep you rolling!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T18:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d958aa3599cc513370e4f6994ccb88be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HugePixel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["HugePixel"], "esrb_rating": null}
