Your curiosity beckons you...</p>\n<p>DOWN Is a procedurally generated arcade style cave exploration game where the goal is to simply wander through a massive\u00a0procedurally cave system, but it's not all fun and games (well it is actually), there are dangerous creatures everywhere, massive pits, and mysteriously placed torches.</p>\n<p>DOWN was originally a small test to see if I could make\u00a0procedurally generated terrain but after a while it became a game, and at that point I just had to finish it. I know it's small and relatively bad but like I said it was just a test. I hope you have fun playing it and good luck.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Windows and Mac versions are UNTESTED and may, bug or have troubles running.</p>\n<p>Please tell me any bugs in the comment section.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T04:08:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f181d84fc4ce20a7de1cc0a42ca7ebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Coding Wizard Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
