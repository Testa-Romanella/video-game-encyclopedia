This 7 months I have been thinking about how to design a new game that can go beyond it, more able to challenge the limits of human intelligence. After dozens of program attempts, I seem to find the way. Last mouth, I designed a new game \"Chinese-Puzzle\" , fortunately it was featured by Apple in China. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people like it. So I designed a new one.<br/><br/>I hope that more people around the world will love it.
