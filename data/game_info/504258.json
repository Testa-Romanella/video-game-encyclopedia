Do it, everyday, because everyone loves cereals. Don\u2019t you ? Ah ah, you should. You really should. You wouldn\u2019t want to anger it, don\u2019t you ?</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>It\u2019s easy, grab the spoon, get some cereals and shove them into your mouth !</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>This game was an experimentation for me and I also have to add : if you\u2019re easily disgusted, you might not want to play it. I laked some time, I wish I could have added some more spooky stuff to it but i\u2019m a lone programmer and I can only do so much by myself. But it\u2019s fine, I had fun (most of the time, lol)</p>\n<p>Hope you\u2019ll like whatever the heck I created !\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The background image is made by a friend.
