Like in many video <br/>\r\ngames, the visitor walks around the museum in <br/>\r\na first person perspective using their mouse and <br/>\r\nkeyboard. The museum has five main rooms, with four of them following the \u201dwhite cube\u201d format. The fifth and biggest room is the main hall where visitors get orientations about the current exhibition.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough most video games and virtual worlds are inhabited by designed objects and textures, these tend to serve a secondary, decorative role. Often acting as scenery or props, the most common aesthetic experience of virtual art is of a peripheral nature. Whether or not something is regarded as an object of \u2019fine art\u2019 or rather as a decorative object is a matter of perception. This difference in perception has much to do with the context in which the given artwork occurs. By mimicking the architectural style of a classical art museum, Virtual Museum for Virtual Art seeks to provide a platform for virtual artworks to be perceived <br/>\r\nand considered as fine art.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-31T03:46:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d74/d74a5dbf5e87ba84881d0b567c9e7c0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tristan Isak Bendixen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Tristan Isak Bendixen"], "esrb_rating": null}
