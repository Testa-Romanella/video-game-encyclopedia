{"id": 556332, "slug": "battler-creeepling", "name": "Battler (Creeepling)", "name_original": "Battler (Creeepling)", "description": "<p>Battler is a bite-sized PvP game, inspired by Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and World of Warcraft. It's currently available for PC only.</p>\r\nA Warrior and a Priest facing two Warriors. Yeah, these sprites are as temporary as they get.\r\n<p>Choose your character(or characterS) and enter a deathmatch! You will have to juggle defending yourself from enemy blows, and trying to set up a strong damaging turn. All in a tiny tactical setup, with no movement mechanic involved!</p>\n<p>There are two classes to choose from, with more coming really soon. You can control up to three characters at once. That's not a technical limitation, but I've done a couple 3v3s against myself while fixing bugs, and my head started to hurt really quickly.</p>\r\nTwo AI teams dishing out some pain to each other. Honestly, after adding AI yesterday I have been spending too much time watching it fight itself.\r\n<p>The game's main focus is Multiplayer. It is fully functional, however, in this early stage of development, there's a prerequisite: you need to be logged into Steam, and you need to add Wienne to your Steam library(it's a free game). That is because I am currently using my previous game's ID to host multiplayer games. It is a temporary thing.</p>\n<p>Invite your friends over for a battle, or test your mettle against the AI! It's not extremely smart yet, but it sometimes beats me :(</p>\r\nIstra is asking for help as she is about to get demolished by 3 green-haired Warriors.\r\n<p>As of 2/11/2011, this project is about 3 weeks old. So be kind to my little baby!</p>\n<p>All feedback is appreciated. More to come soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:18:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33b55db0179e55ba8c553c844ff4b3af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creeepling"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
