You play as Okui, a monster who loves eating candy and he is looking for new flavours. Okui discovers that there is a group of islands called Sugar Woods where everything is made of candy, villagers too. So he decides to sail to the islands and\u2026 well, eat all the candy villagers.</p>\n\n<p>As Okui you have to find the weighing machine of every zone to know the weight needed in order to get the access to the next one. Find and chase the villagers to eat them but be careful, some physical activities might make you lose weight. So you have to decide if it\u2019s worth it climbing a hill to check if there is someone you can eat, running after that small candy or investing time solving a puzzle.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>OUR DELICIOUS TEAM</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Programmer: Julen Hodgson</li><li>Lead artist: Lorena L\u00f3pez</li><li>3D artist:\u00a0I\u00f1igo Garriga</li><li>Music: Pablo Espada</li></ul>\n\n<p>Stay sweet and tuned on TWITTER and INSTAGRAM!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T06:44:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f8/8f892cd334832ed3de77465b4ae4c84e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["muffin"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
