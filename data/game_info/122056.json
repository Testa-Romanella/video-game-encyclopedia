When adventuring they would just be cut down with little to know effort in fighting back. What people didn't know is that humans were the only predator to slimes, and after decades of being left alone they have had the chance to grow, strengthen, and multiply out of control. You play as the heroes setting out to take back the world from the over abundance of slimes threatening to destroy everything. Traverse different environments, and fight a variety of special slimes that have had a chance to evolve over the years in this colorful adventure with danger at every corner.</p>\n<p>Optimal Control Setup: Keyboard and Mouse.
