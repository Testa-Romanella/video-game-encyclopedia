It's Black Friday, so you head to the mall, shopping list in hand, to grab some deals. Go through the three doors at the north end of each floor to check out the wares available, and buy the item of the shopping list that's on your floor. There are ten floors, and once you get to the top, you just have to climb back down to win! Of course, you have to battle be-hoodied ghosts and Segway-riding zombies to get your prizes, but don't be afraid!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T04:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209bc7901ee20780407ecca723cbdd40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Unfocused Locust Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
