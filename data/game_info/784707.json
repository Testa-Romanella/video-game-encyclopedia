You can only have three arrows in use at a time, attempting to release a fourth will simply do nothing. When the arrow hits an eye, it will disappear, but some eyes will need more than one arrow. All you need to do is to prevent any eyes from hitting you.</p>\n<p>The game will soon have flashier visuals, audio, and more bosses. As it is right now, it's in a playable state.</p><p>Font used is\u00a0https://www.fontspace.com/simvoni-font-f54420\u00a0licensed as free for commercial use.
