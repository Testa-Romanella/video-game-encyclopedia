{"id": 642724, "slug": "switchbeats-jam-entry", "name": "SwitchBeats (Jam Entry)", "name_original": "SwitchBeats (Jam Entry)", "description": "<p>SwitchBeats is a multi-route Rhythm game, where you play notes falling from the top and switch between 3 boards of notes.<br/></p>\n\n<p>This was made for the RHYTHM JAM 2021.<br/>The theme is:\u00a0EVERY _____. I chose <strong>EVERY ROUTE!\u00a0</strong>Meaning that, unlike a traditional rhythm game where you always play on the same route, you have to switch between 3 different routes by pressing a key and still going on with the same keys for the notes. This is different from, for example, DDR where the same note on different routes are played with different keys.</p>\r\n\u00a0<br/>Put your headphones on!\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong>Arrow Keys:\u00a0play notes<br/>Z /\u00a0X:\u00a0switch board (follow the arrows)</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY<br/>- Press Arrow Up, Right or Left when the falling arrows are on the red line at the bottom of the screen. This will play the notes.<br/>- Press X or Z when the yellow/red arrows going left or right are on the red line at the bottom of the screen. This will change the route depending of the direction (Z goes left, X goes right). You can press those buttons freely but will end your combo if you do it without following the indications.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong><strong>Developer, Art<br/></strong>omagerio</p>\n<p><strong>Songs<br/></strong>Of Far Different Nature - Cruiser (CC-BY)<br/>Geovane Bruno - Friend</p>\n<p><strong>Put your score in the comments below, along with your comments or suggestions!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d1/2d19259008e1bed9299b8dc2e57ba492.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["omagerio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
