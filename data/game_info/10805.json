The crew is missing and the entire facility is dealing with catastrophic power issues. As you start to uncover the ship\u2019s terrifying secrets, Shakhter-One threatens to take your identity, your sanity, and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 your life.<br/><br/>The worst evil is the one that knows us better than we know ourselves.<br/>The worst nightmare is the one borne in our past, emotions, fears, and pain.<br/><br/>Key features:<br/><br/><ul><li>Explore a derelict mining facility in orbit around Jupiter<br/></li><li>Fight through the nightmare and solve the mystery of the Shakhter-One<br/></li><li>Face your fears head-on or use the environment as your ally<br/></li><li>Solve puzzles and use your brain to proceed<br/></li><li>Master face-paced, frenetic gun combat to survive<br/></li><li>Reveal the backstory of the protagonist and set him free from his demons\u2026 or succumb to them.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T06:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/260/2609ef4e5141dceedc651983ff5c605f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.27, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 9, "owned": 71, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 15, "suggestions_count": 339, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["MMEU"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Forever Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
