You wouldn't describe your job as a \u201cdead end\" but you could certainly use more money and, frankly, something more interesting to do. Hopefully this all pays off. Hmm? What's that sound?<br/>\n<br/><em>\r\nYour phone is buzzing.</em><br/>\n<br/>\r\nTechnoccult: Covenant is a short form interactive fiction game inspired by PC-98 era visual novels, the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, and psychopunk classics like Boogiepop Phantom and Serial Experiments Lain. Can you find all three endings?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe original soundtrack, which you can find here, uses the sounds of the Yamaha YM2608 and Roland JX-305 to emulate the textures of the PC-98 and early 90s electronic music. The recording draws inspiration from the works of Ryu Umemoto and Shoji Meguro in an attempt to articulate sonic aspects of the psychopunk aesthetic.</p><p><em>\r\nScenario, Design, and Programming</em><br/>Eliot Gardepe<br/>\n<br/><em>\r\nMusic</em><br/>Eliot Gardepe<br/>\n<br/><em>\r\nProduced By</em><br/>Psychopunk<br/>\n<br/><em>\r\nPlaytesting</em><br/>Alicia Acampora, John Evanofski, and Roger Goodman<br/>\n<br/><em>\r\nSpecial Thanks</em><br/>Roger Goodman, Chris Hendrix, and Ren'Py<br/><br/>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/036dbab2f13289b952d06c150362c188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eliot Gardepe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
