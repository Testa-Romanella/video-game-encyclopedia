Why would you let such wet floaty bastards just float around doing nothing but dropping apples? Pick them up and throw them right back at them. Yeah. Show them who's the boss.</p><p>At some point, eventually, they'll probably just leave, die, or do nothing.</p><p>Use W, A, S and D to move around.<br/></p><p>Left-Click to throw apples.</p><p>Space to jump.</p><p>Move the mouse to look around.</p><p>Throw apples at the apple-dropping clouds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/759/759043f19cc695dc4a7ac7958066503d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nilq"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
