Sounds effects are from zapsplat.com.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This year at my university, I specialise in character animation for movies and games so I thought I\u2019ll participate in Search For A Star competition which challenged and motivated me last year.\r\n  </p>\n<p>When I looked at Search For A Star 2020 brief I knew how I was going to approach that project because I\u2019ve participated in this competition last year. This time, I\u2019ve decided to make sure animation sequences work in UE4. Last year, I was told that it\u2019s good to have an actual gameplay animation on animation showreel so I\u2019ve done a few additional animation sequences.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The character which I\u2019m using is modelled by Nikola Milievi and rigged by Kiel Figgins: https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/1283942?referral=kielfiggins</p>\n<p>In terms of what kind of game this animation sequences would fit into; I\u2019ve decided to animate the character as if it was for a game like Witcher 3 or Dragon Age: Inquisition. In that kind of games, the player can see the character from each side so I was making sure it looked all right from each perspective, but my main focus was on the back view because that\u2019s how the camera shows the character.   </p>\n<p>When I looked at the design of the rig, I have decided that I will create a rough character personality to help me figure out what will drive intentions, feelings and characters movements.</p>\n<p>It helped me a lot to add depth to the main character.</p>\n<p>The concept was to make her sassy and constantly analysing what\u2019s around her. She knows how to use fire to attack her opponents. It was tough to make sure that animation was responsive enough so I\u2019ve started from doing a rough version of each sequence to figure out the timing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Animation sequences:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>That's the breakdown of animation sequences for the competition:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Idle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The character waits impatiently for a battle, looking around, getting ready by constantly creating a small fireball which quickly disappears.   </p>\n<p><strong>Power Up</strong>\n</p>\n<p>That state illustrates gathering energy to be able to strike the opponent again.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Release</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Fiery witch gathers the fire underneath her and releases in front of the opponent with an explosion to deal the highest possible damage.   </p>\n<p><strong>Recovery</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Heavy breathing means the main character has lost most of her energy and she can\u2019t move\u2026 That\u2019s why the player has to power up by pressing space.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Walk Cycle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Seducing way of walking makes her more dangerous because opponents underestimate her by thinking she\u2019s just a pretty girl. Yes, she is. But she\u2019s a powerful warrior too.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Run Cycle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>She can run pretty quickly to make sure she avoids any danger.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Light Release</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When she needs to destroy the enemy quickly, that\u2019s the easiest way to do so. Quick fireball does the job, but it\u2019s less powerful than release.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Orc Idle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve animated second character to make the game a bit more entertaining.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Orc Death</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When Samantha organises a show of the fire, usually someone dies. In this case, it\u2019s an orc.\u00a0   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Influences:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I was inspired mainly by Witcher 3 and Dragon Age: Inquisition and many cinematics advertising games like World of Warcraft and League of Legends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Brainstorming</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Brainstorming was a pretty quick process because I knew at that stage which character I\u2019ll use. I wanted to create a good looking choreography and then connect animation with particles. At some point, I\u2019ve decided to use fire attacks because they looked the best to me.\r\n  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Video Reference</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve made many sessions to figure out the movement because what looked good in Premiere, it didn\u2019t look good in rough blocking.   </p>\n<p>Those are just a few screenshots from my video reference (blurred on purpose):\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Production</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All four animation sequences were completed in about three weeks. I am really glad to see how much I improved animating skills during that period. To produce that project, I have used Autodesk Maya 2018, UE4 and Premiere 2018. Throughout the animation process, I\u2019ve used a mixture of the pose to pose method combined with straight-ahead animating to plan it better and at the same time to avoid losing spontaneity.</p>\n<p>In the beginning, I was just creating a few quick poses from my head to test what\u2019s the best timing because responsiveness was the most crucial.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Programming the movement, attacks and the enemy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t know much about blueprints and programming, but I\u2019ve learned how to create a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0third-person view fantasy game by watching lots of tutorials on YouTube. Those are just a few examples of the blueprints which I\u2019ve created to produce an actual interactive game where your actions affect the enemy.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Animation</strong></p>\n<p>Then, I\u2019ve done blocking in stepped mode using video reference shot before. Breakdowns and in-betweens came right after. Then I\u2019ve used auto tangents and I\u2019ve started to refine each sequence by tracking arcs, cleaning curves in the graph editor, offsetting selected body parts and making sure there was an overlap, especially on wrists and head.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found animation layers really handy for idle animation. It simplified the whole process of adding head turns and blinks.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Refinement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve taken care of the sound too because that\u2019s 50% of the success of a game. I wanted to have an amazing environment and FX in the game so I\u2019ve got environment and particles from UE Marketplace:</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve imported default level from Infinity Blade: Grass Lands:</p>\n<p>After testing the gameplay I\u2019ve realised that default lighting and the environment wasn\u2019t conveying the mood which I was going for so I\u2019ve changed it. Also, I\u2019ve combined few sound effects from Zapsplat.com and a few visual effects to make a game more interactive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are still some bugs in a game and I wish I would have more time to refine animation. However, I suppose I did fine with the project considering time constraints. I hope whoever plays that short game, will enjoy it.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c13285f943f7fa6e1447e2b591fefbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaciejOsuch"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
