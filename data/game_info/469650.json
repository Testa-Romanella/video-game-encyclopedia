I have contributed actively on the codification with two other members.</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Journey is the destination\", so we decided to make a modern interpretation of the Greek myth of Sisyphus and its eternal punishment. In this interpretation, Sisyphus is a businessman who was condamned with the most useless task a person could have. Modern Sisyphus must carry his suitcase infinetely aiming the success, however, his suitcase returns to the beginning of the route supernaturaly and he has to restart their task. This is a philosophical and endless game where the player is Sisyphus himself fulfilling their punishment. An opportunity to practice pacience and determination.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Also visit team members' portfolio at:</p>\n<p>Kaio Rauta<br/>https://misterkaiou.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Guilherme Simionato<br/>https://guilherme-simionato.itch.io</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T05:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ff/3ff9f0596ee313d3c39040a305fb5455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flucate"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
