Most of the stages are planetary locations, like an Ancient Egyptianish Mars, Metropolitan Earth, and Saturn. Some are non-planet astronomical objects like the moon or the sun. On the final stage, the player finds must battle on a \"planetoid\". The \"waves\" consist of three preset views denoted as ALPHA (1st person), DELTA (side scroller), and GAMMA (top view or original Galaga view).</p>\n<p>If a tractor beam ship is destroyed, there is a chance that a cube will come out. If the player catches this cube, they will get a temporary tractor beam that can capture an enemy ship. Captured enemy ships will then act as wing-men for your fighter until destroyed by enemy fire, just as they do in Gaplus.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2000-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18f/18faad9866ff0e943917ef9d47a3a895.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "Game Boy Color", "PC"], "developers": ["King of the Jungle"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": ["Hasbro Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
