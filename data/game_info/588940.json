You must attempt to escape with your life...</p>\n\n<p>Game Length: <em>8-12 mins</em></p>\n<p><strong>! Contains Flashing Lights and Jump Scares !</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm throwing my hat into the ring with my first game, developed solely by\u00a0me over the course of about 6 months (off and on, learning all the skills necessary from scratch).\u00a0 Unfortunately yeah, it's only a short game. It's more of a proof of concept or a expression of interest\u00a0really. To see if I could make something people might\u00a0like, and maybe scare a few in the process. If you want to see more of these characters, or want to help me make\u00a0other games in the future,\u00a0 please consider donating a buck or two through the \"pay what you want\" function.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p><em>\"Be Careful...
