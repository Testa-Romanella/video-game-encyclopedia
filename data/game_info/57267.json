Despite being released the same year as the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling's WrestleWar pay-per-view, it is not associated with any wrestling promotion. The original Japanese game cover featured a Hulk Hogan look-alike. It was changed for the European and US releases for royalties reasons. It did not change the wrestlers faces though, which still are similar to those of real wrestling stars of the time.</p>\n<p>Wrestle War has also been released as part of the Sega Smash Pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-13T20:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff5/ff53ba8eaee9a0980855427e10b26866.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 280, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Genesis"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
