{"id": 685505, "slug": "dragonstorm", "name": "DragonStorm", "name_original": "DragonStorm", "description": "<p>DragonStorm is a game taking place in a fantasy world where you the player have to save the world. The Dragon nation has attacked the Sorcerers, Elves, and Wardens and you must defend and help keep the world safe. You play the game by placing down units (The Elves, Sorcerers, and Wardens) and upgrading them in order to take down the dragons before they reach the end.</p>\n<p>This game is a far cry from the usual types of games that we make, and so we had to figure out seemingly simple issues such as properly making upgrades for each unit, pathing for enemy units, and creating a UI in an engine such as pixelPAD.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A highlight of our game is that it offers lots of gameplay and can be played many times with varied playstyles. The code in our game is very open-ended, and if we ever choose to, we have the ability to come back to it and add as many levels, waves, units, and unique enemies as we want. If we had more time I believe we could use this strength in order to make a more in-depth game with many more levels, even more unique assets, and a more involved story.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T06:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1e41bd8d5e580276a304ccc055c6cc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelPAD.io"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
