In this solar system, you have to duel against your opponent whilst dodging and avoiding asteroids and moving planets. Not only so! As your ship gets damaged bullet by bullet, collision by collision, your ship's ability to resist against the sun's gravity will also weaken! Furthermore, your ship's maneuverability will also deteriorate as you keep taking more and more hits.</p>\n<p>But of course, there is a way out! Unless you have crushed your opponent already at this point, there are health canisters that look like this:</p>\n\n<p>That's your way out! And you'll find those time-to-time orbiting casually around the sun.</p>\n<p>Oh no! Look's like your opponent has the upper hand as they are getting closer to <strong>your</strong> juicy health canister! No worries, you can try to\u00a0<strong>shoot the health canister away from your opponent!</strong><br/></p>\n\r\n\r\nControls\r\n<strong>Player 1</strong><strong>Player 2</strong>MovementWASDIJKL<em>(Controller)</em>Left Analog StickRight Analog StickShootC or SpaceN or Left Mouse Button<em>(Controller)</em>Left BumperRight BumperPauseEscape<br/>Escape<em>(Controller)</em>StartStart\r\n<p>(Sorry that I could not get multi-controller support in time, I hope this 1-controller-2-player system is fine)</p>\n\n<p>There are known bugs that could not be resolved in time for this submission.

Please do not have expectations that are too high. As my first game jam, it was very fun indeed and I really appreciate that you tried my humble game. I would also like to thank Mark Brown (A.K.A.) Game Maker's Toolkit for hosting this huge game jam.
