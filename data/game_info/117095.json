Players wander through an immense maze, and have to find three relics to find its exit. </p><p>They try their luck only one at a time, with a very limited lifespan, and have no way to defend themselves from the various dangers that await them:<strong><em> they can only communicate with each other.</em></strong></p><em>...And help each other!</em><p>Each time a player visits the maze, she leaves <strong>traces</strong> everywhere she goes, giving <strong>hints</strong> on the paths she took, the <strong>dead ends</strong>, and the <strong>dangers</strong> on the way. The players coming after her will be able to see and follow these paths as they want. </p><p>As multiple players wander into the labyrinth, <strong><em>collective intelligence</em></strong> will progressively mark the safe routes and dangers, leading players to find the relics, and finish the game, but <strong>it won't be over!</strong></p><p>Every time players solve a labyrinth, a new one is <strong><em>procedurally generated</em></strong>, creating a completely <strong><em>new and unique</em></strong> challenge to solve!</p><em>Gather data</em><p>The choices and actions players make in the game are <strong><em>recorded in the game metrics</em></strong>, showing their routes, how they used the traces left by others, complied to the rules of communication, or how fast they beat the game. </p><p>This game's intention is to provide <strong>a new kind of research tool to observe cooperative behaviours</strong> between players, when they cannot communicate directly but have to reach a common goal through iterations in an unknown environment.<br/></p><p>The game currently<strong> does not feature online playing and data storing</strong>, but it is fully working locally. The data can be directly copied to an excel file to be processed as you see fit.</p><p><strong><em>This game was made in one month during the Game Lab Summer School 2016, organised by the Gamelab of the Center for Research &amp; Interdisciplinarity of Paris.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f173ad851a732880ec9fb65656dd86d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NachoDeluxe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
