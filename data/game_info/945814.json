This is my very first game, but it's not finished because of my mistake (Just yesterday it was completely ready, but I accidentally deleted the folder with scripts, yes, I'm good, I know!), 2 months of work just disappeared, and it's very disappointing. About the game itself: this is a 2D platformer with some kind of plot (mini plot), you can download and watch. I would just like to say that you would rate it honestly (please), I tried on it, and as I wrote earlier, everything is gone.
