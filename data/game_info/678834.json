{"id": 678834, "slug": "vga-golf", "name": "VGA Golf", "name_original": "VGA Golf", "description": "<p>VGA Golf is a local or networked multiplayer golfing sim, modeled on 90s era console and DOS games. The game supports 4 players locally (on the same computer) with 4 controller support, hot seat keyboard play or a mixture of both. A maximum of 4 computers can connect to a single game across the internet or over a local network allowing up to 16 players in a single match.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>\n<p>Playing VGA Golf over a network requires a host on one computer, which must first create a game and then enter a lobby.</p>\n\n<p> Once the host is in Lobby mode, further computers can connect to it by selecting Join Game, configuring local players then typing in the IP address or host name of the computer to which to connect. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Both hosts and computers who join will need to allow port 16002 UDP/TCP through any local firewall. Local games (games run on a single computer) also use networking by creating a server on the local host *<em>so they must also have this port open</em>* even when they're not playing online. Windows Firewall may warn about the game attempting to access this port the first time it is run, but it is OK to allow it. If you do not, the game will not be able to start. If you wish to play VGA Golf over the internet then the host must also allow 16002 UDP/TCP through any external firewalls, as well as correctly configure NAT or Port Forwarding which may be in place on the host's router. For more information about Port Forwarding and configuring NAT see this page.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br/></p>\n<p>VGA Golf is also open source - so while there are only binaries for Windows available here, it can also be built for both Linux and macOS. The open source nature means that it is also possible to create your own courses with software such as Blender, and share them with your friends or the community. Video tutorials for making your own courses will be coming soon!\u2122 Games created on a Windows host may be joined by clients on Linux or macOS systems, and vice versa - ie VGA Golf supports cross-platform play.<br/></p>\n<p>The source can be found at GitHub<br/></p>\n<p>Please feel free to contribute with ideas, bugs or other suggestions via this page or the GitHub page!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Version History:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>14/10/2021 Version 1.0.0 - Initial release</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c43/c43160c32e17fcd285b4589389b7bd41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fallahn"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
