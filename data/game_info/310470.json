Our design challenge for the semester was to create 4GOOD - and whether it is possible to achieve certain positive desired shifts using immersive VR experiences.\u00a0\u00a0The team behind this project and few others was comprised of classroom of 18 people and was developed through two epics using Agile and Scrum. We had two public user testing sessions during which we received feedback and refined our concepts in iterative fashion.</p>\n<p>This is an exerpt from the SIAR website:</p>\r\nThese works were created by students from different SFU departments who joined our Semester in Alternate Realities. The works are part of an emerging field of development and research that use VR and other emerging technologies to increase aware\u00adness and be a catalyst for improving our world.\u00a0These projects are the culmination of 14 weeks of an intense, iterative, agile, reflective and adaptive teaching and learning process. Four distinct yet interconnected \u201cfor good\u201d Virtual Reality experiences focused on themes related to improving the social and environmental condition, by not only drawing awareness to issues in the world that require our attention, but also providing unique first-person experiences that we could not have without immersive technology.\r\nTeam<p>Amber Shao,\u00a0Vlad Ryzhov, Alex Aguilar, Ana Karen Martinez, Elene Wanner, Ioana Sandor, Jonathan Lee, Leo Danenkov, Lukas Ritter, Nicholas Ramsay, Nick MacKay, Oliver Aung, Qiuli Wu, Radu Orlandea, Ricky Lalli, Robert, Sheri Wong, Zoe Temple-Sandison and our professors and mentors Bernhard Riecke and Patrick Pennefather</p>Licenses\r\n<p>3D models used in the project:</p>\n<ul><li>\u201cVoxel Castle\u201d by forrygames is licensed under CC BY 4.0</li><li>\u201cTower\u201d by wipof is licensed under CC BY 4.0</li></ul>\n<p>Shaders used in the project:</p>\n<ul><li>\u201cHologramShader\u201d by andydbc is licensed under MIT</li></ul>\n<p>Music used in the project</p>\n<ul><li>\u201cBy the Sea\u201d by ONYRIX - Dino Olivieri.
