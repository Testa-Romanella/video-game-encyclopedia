It is based on the manga and anime series Ranma \u00bd. Hard Battle is the second Ranma \u00bd game to be translated into English, this time keeping the original graphics, music, and names of the characters, though the voices were still dubbed into English. The game&#39;s English translation (but not its English voice acting) was provided by Viz Media.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T09:05:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/967/967d1f4cd5e69fb2299e3db450a26950.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Atelier Double"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Ocean Software", "Masaya", "Nippon Computer Systems", "DTMC"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
