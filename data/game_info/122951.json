The main goal is to complete all 8 levels and compete for a high score. Gain points by collecting striped blocks and by narrowly avoiding solid blocks and spikes.\u00a0<em>Karma\u00a0</em>uses a point system that rewards risk taking - such as staying at as low health as possible. In addition, points gained in the ending section of each level will be put towards points used to continue - but be warned, if you run out of lives, the game will start over.<br/><br/>Use the arrow keys or click to move the orb.</p>\n<p>Press \"F\" to toggle fullscreen.<br/><br/>PS.
