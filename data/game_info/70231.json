They take turns moving their pieces. Players move their pieces diagonally from one square to another square. When a player jumps over their opponent's (the other player's) piece, he takes that piece from the board. By default a potential piece will have to be taken but you can set custom rules and disable this rule.<br/><br/>The player's goal is to take all the pieces of its opponent.<br/><br/>With this version of Checkers (also known as Draughts) , you can play with a friend who sits next to you or play against your phone.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/052/052daceef4f043ca5e7732c5b7c4537f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Shawn Mottley"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Shawn Mottley"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
