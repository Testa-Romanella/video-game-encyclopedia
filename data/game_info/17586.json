It is the first installment in its series. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As its name suggests, the game is inspired by the pen and paper RPGs in the vein of classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons. In Knights of Pen &amp; Paper, the player controls a group of people who participate in a tabletop role-playing session. The Dungeon Master is also under player&#39;s control. The player uses the DM to set up the battles with monsters and then leads the party members as they crawl through the dungeons in a fantasy world. The characters and the DM are shown onscreen in the foreground. The monsters and the locations appear in the background.</p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>Each party includes up to 5 members. The game has a total of 19 characters with personalities like &quot;Little Brother&quot;, &quot;Hipster&quot; or &quot;Nerd&quot;. 14 of the characters are available from the start and 5 bonus &quot;Dev Crew&quot; characters can be unlocked. Each character has his or her personal bonus ability.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game is made in a &quot;retro&quot; pixelated visual style and is set to simple chiptune music. Knights of Pen &amp; Paper includes a number of comical references to the classic role-playing games and popular culture.</p>\n<h3>Edition features</h3>\n<p>+1 edition includes additional dungeons and monsters. There are also new character abilities to use during the battles that make the fights more varied.
