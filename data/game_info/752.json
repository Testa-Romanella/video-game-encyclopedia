{"id": 752, "slug": "smite", "name": "SMITE", "name_original": "SMITE", "description": "<p>Smite is a free-to-play MOBA game developed by Hi-Rez Studios.</p>\n<p>Gods from multiple mythologies serve as playable characters in the game. Each god has three base abilities, one ultimate ability, and one passive ability. Each character can buy up to 6 passive items that grant stats bonuses and up to 2 active items that give the player new abilities such as teleporting or healing. Such items don&#39;t require mana but have a long recovery time.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to destroy the opposing team&#39;s lane defenders and their Titan. Players are followed by minions that deal small amounts of damage to towers, lane defenders, the Titan or the opposing players.</p>\n<p>Smite features a five-class system. Players are free to choose from assassin, warrior, mage, hunter and guardian classes. Each class has it&#39;s own specifics and should be carefully chosen according to the situation on the arena.</p>\n<p>In contrast to other MOBA&#39;s, there are multiple game modes in Smite. The main differences between them are the amount of gold the players spawn with, the number of players, and the number of lanes.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2015-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T13:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cc7/cc77035eb972f179f5090ee2a0fabd99.jpg", "website": "http://smitegame.com", "rating": 3.06, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 117, "owned": 4894, "beaten": 100, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 602, "playing": 55}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 760, "ratings_count": 784, "suggestions_count": 656, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 784, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hi-Rez Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Hi-Rez Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
