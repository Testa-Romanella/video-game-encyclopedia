It's a pretty simple 2D Arcade shooter that follows the theme by having the player convert enemies to their side to be absorbed once they are defeated. I know there's a lot of areas in which I can learn more and\u00a0improve in future projects, but I had fun putting this together. Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:44:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c88/c88b896e8f3264a13b994737f0c4333b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arlucian"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
