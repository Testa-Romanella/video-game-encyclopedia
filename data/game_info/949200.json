It's a platformer. There are collectables. There is combat. There is some really nice movement stuff. There are bugs. I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>If you want a real challenge,\u00a0are two categories I suggest you speedrun if you fancy it....\u00a0any% is just collect the final treasure chest in world 4-3 as quickly as possible. 100% would be doing the same but collecting all 60 pints of grog on the way.
