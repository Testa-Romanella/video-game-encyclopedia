Arrange the pieces of the puzzle so that when he falls, gravity and momentum guide him safely (and probably painfully) to the end.<br/><br/>\u201cThis is just a chemical reaction - all in my mind. And what a fine, strong mind it is - handsome even - and more than capable of riding out this hallucination, clearly caused by cosmic rays... Right?\u201d <strong>Multi-dimensional levels!</strong><br/>Every level has up to 5 playfields, arranged in a cube. Rotate the level and move the objects in each panel, then release Commander Johnson and hope he makes it through to the final wormhole! Deal with unreliable gravity, trampolines, conveyor belts, and other fun inconveniences. <br/><br/>\"What if this isn\u2019t all in my mind? What if\u2026 what if something is moving these objects? Or someone\u2026\u201d <strong>Oculus Rift VR-o-Vision Support!</strong><br/>The game is designed with the Oculus Rift in mind.
