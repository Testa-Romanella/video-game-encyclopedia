Choose to be nice to, rude to, or to murder your potential girlfriends, it's up to you! I'm making this game completely myself, and any support you offer will help make my dream a reality.\u00a0<em>Even if that support is just a follow or a nice comment! It's very motivating.</em><br/></p>\n<p>My overall goal in creating is to make people feel something. I want players to feel moved or inspired to create their own games. If you feel like the messages or story in On Track Dating might not come across as impactful as possible, let me know! Nicely, please.</p>\n<p>Support me on\u00a0my patreon!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:42:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37ce10a6530591ce5ee213fe4236506e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Skarlet Williams"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
