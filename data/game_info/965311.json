In \"Are You Sure?\" you play the role of a husband who, wanting to spice up their sex, convinced his wife to try a one week open marriage adventure. After all, it's not cheating if you both agree. During this week you and your wife will test different things and see if this will improve your relationship or destroy it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Eva is a sophisticated woman. A loving woman, who would do anything her husband ask of her, however be careful because your requests for her might push her away instead of pulling her closer to you. It's good to experience new things as long as you're both on the same page.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is a story-centric game that is played in a text application, where the player gets to talk via texts with Eva about your day, work, affairs, and maybe exchange some nudes. <br/><br/>The game has 70 different images you can unlock and 4 different endings, based on your choices, so be sure to choose wisely.<br/><br/><strong>FETISHES</strong><br/>3DCG, Avoidable Netorare, Blowjob, Handjob, Vaginal Sex, Anal, Corruption, Creampie, Facial, Cheating, Stripping, Teasing, Teen (over 18), Romance, Big Ass, Big Boobs", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T03:10:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f06ff93014b1ad328daa6de5f8f289f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoyalCandy"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RoyalCandy"], "esrb_rating": null}
