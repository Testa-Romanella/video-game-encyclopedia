Because it means \"Cailloux\" in french. I find it fun. I like fun.\r\n|| FEATURES ||\r\n- Newtonian-like physics (experience the true spaaaaaace feeling and win your astrophysics PHD at the endgame)\r\n- Powerups and consommables\r\n- Endless level with scaled difficulty\r\n- 2 player gameplay on one keyboard (see CONTROLS below)\r\n---\r\n|| CONTROLS ||\r\nPlayer 1\r\nA (or Q) - Turn Left\r\nD - Turn Right\r\nW (or Z) - Go forward\r\nSPACEBAR - Shoot\r\nF - Activate Shield (consumes shield reserve)\r\n-\r\nPlayer 2\r\nENTER - Join game\r\nLeft Arrow - Turn Left\r\nRight Arrow - Turn Right\r\nUp Arrow - Go forward\r\nP - Shoot\r\nO - Activate Shield (consumes shield reserve)\r\n---\r\n|| DIFFICULTY ||\r\nSpace Pebbles uses incremental difficulty. As the global score rises, the difficulty is increased\r\nThe difficulty formula works like this:\r\n15 base Asteroids + (score/easyness). The more the score rises, the more asteroids can spawn.\r\nAsteroids speed: 1 + (score/easyness_asteroids). The more the score rises, the more the newly created asteroids will have speed.\r\neasyness value changes from 50 to 150 if a second player joins the game.\r\neasyness_asteroids value is set to 50000\r\n---\r\n|| POWERUPS AND OBJECTS ||\r\nPowerUps can appears if the global score reaches certain values:\r\n- Score 50: Big Shield Boost can appear. Gives +200 Shield. When global score reaches 3000, does not appear anymore.\r\n- Score 1000: Bombs can appear. Explodes everything except players in the explosion area. Sweet for the eyes.\r\n- Score 1500: LevelUp can appear. Each time a player collide with one of them, gain 1 level, up to a maximum of 4. Each level gives a new weapon ability.\r\n- Score 3000: Big Shield Boost don't appear anymore, but Meteors can appear. When destroyed, they drop a small shield boost, which gives +50 Shield.\r\n---\r\n|| CREDITS ||\r\n- Using GameMaker Studio 2 Engine - https://yoyogames.com\r\n- Fully created and programmed by Eloi Fromang\u00e9-Gonin - http://eloi-fg.com\r\n- Based on a GameMaker Studio 2 tutorial by FriendlyCosmonaut https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIc8Kon5PFw\r\n- Open Source sounds effects from Zapsplat.com - https://zapsplat.com\r\n- Music under Creative Commons licence by TeknoAXE - http://teknoaxe.com\r\n---\r\nSpecial thanks to my family, my friends and my girlfriend for playtesting and breaking the game &lt;3\r\nYou guys rock ! (in space)\r\n|| ABOUT ||\r\nMy goal with this project was to experiment with the GameMaker script language as well as integrating a smooth difficulty curve in a seemless level. The main challenge was to add the possibility of a second player joining the game whenever he.she wants and have the difficulty linked to the number of players.\r\nAdd-on of powerups help the game to last as long as the players skill can compete with the speed of the asteroids.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T04:32:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e004d2560880df7394258a1ea812840b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Eloi FG"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
