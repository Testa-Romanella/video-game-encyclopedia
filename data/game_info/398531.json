Place a slime and explore multiple different sewers. From a normal one, to Crystal sewers and even one that's overgrown. Defeat enemies and obtain their powers to upgrade yourself. Greatly inspired by games like Hollowknight and Shantae.</p>\n<p>Game was for the metroidvania gamejam, but will be updated overtime.<br/></p>\r\nGame still in development;\u00a0\r\n<p>Things will change as I just wanted a working gamejam game. Sound effects are missing, and no NPCs to talk to. The boss also immediately starts. No title screen, but you can save and load at the save stations.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure to save at least once before you die! As there is no pre-save before this.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Art design/Coding by;</strong><br/>Yawning Fox</p>\n<p>Music by;<br/>YMRED<br/><br/>Sound Effects/coding by;<br/>PotatoTeto<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T02:18:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf9/bf95b7664782b8d6cc3bc824f15dadd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yawning Fox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
