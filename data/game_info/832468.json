{"id": 832468, "slug": "ultimate-odyssey", "name": "Ultimate Odyssey", "name_original": "Ultimate Odyssey", "description": "Introduction\r\n<p><em>Ultimate Odyssey</em>\u00a0is an adventure exploration game where you take on the role of a destined hero to rid the lands of a darkness falling over it. Creatures are getting vicious and attacking people. Pirates have taken over the waters. And there are even reports of the dead rising from their graves. Can you find the source of the deadly incursion and put a stop to it?\r\n</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>There are three main modes of play: interacting, traveling, and fighting.</p>\r\nInteracting\r\n<p>When you interact with people, or have choices to make, you'll be presented with a dialogue box with options. Use the arrow keys to highlight and select the option you want and press the Z or X button to confirm.\r\n</p>\r\nTraveling\r\n<p>While being shown the map of the world, you can travel around it using the arrow keys. You can use the z key to switch between holding your sword and your bow, depending on how you want to be prepared for any fights that come along. You can use the x key to see your hero's current status.\r\n</p>\r\nFighting\r\n<p>Sometimes, you will be attacked and need to defend yourself! Combat is turn-based in this game. When it's your turn, you can move using the arrow keys. Running into an enemy will cause you to attack them.\r\n</p>\n<p>As while traveling, you can use the z key to switch weapons, but watch out \u2013 switching weapons takes time, and gives the enemy a chance to take a turn!\r\n</p>\n<p>You can also use the x key to bring up a list of special moves:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Attack with a bow.</strong>\u00a0Allows you to attack an enemy at range. When you select this, a targeting reticle will appear. Use the arrow keys to move it to the target you want to fire an arrow at and press x to fire or z to cancel. Only available if you are currently wielding your bow and you have at least one arrow. Some terrain blocks your ability to attack enemies; when you have a valid target, the reticle turns green.\r\n</li><li><strong>Precise attack.</strong>\u00a0Raises the chance to hit on your next attack. Useful when you're having a hard time hitting the enemy. It costs one stamina, though, and gives the enemy a turn.\r\n</li><li><strong>Power attack.</strong>\u00a0Raises the damage you do on your next attack. Useful when you're not doing much damage. It costs one stamina, and gives the enemy a turn.\r\n</li><li><strong>Fight defensively.</strong>\u00a0Raises your defense the next time you are attacked, making it harder to hit you. It also allows you to regain some stamina, but it gives the enemy a turn.\r\n</li><li><strong>Swap weapon.</strong>\u00a0Same as pressing z, this lets you swap between your bow and your sword.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n\r\nYour Hero\r\n<p>Your hero has several measures that you can improve by getting training or improving equipment.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Health</strong>\u00a0(Represented by a heart.) Your current health. If you ever run out, you die. Try to not let that happen.\r\n</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>\u00a0(Represented by a star.) Your current stamina. If you run out, you cannot use special maneuvers.\r\n</li><li><strong>Level</strong>\u00a0Determines your health point and stamina maxima.\r\n</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>\u00a0Helps when attacking, with both chance to hit and to damage the opponent, but only with melee attacks.\r\n</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>\u00a0Helps when attacking with a bow, both chance to hit and to damage, dodging attacks, and escaping.\r\n</li><li><strong>Sword</strong>\u00a0Helps with melee attacks.\r\n</li><li><strong>Bow</strong>\u00a0Helps with ranged attacks.\r\n</li><li><strong>Armor</strong>\u00a0Helps reduce damage when you get hit.\r\n</li><li><strong>Shield</strong>\u00a0Helps reduce chance of getting hit.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Search the land for trainers, advisors, and craftspeople to help you improve these stats \u2013 you'll need higher stats to win the game!\r\n</p>\r\nDying, Saving, and Loading\r\n<p>The game saves whenever you change locations from one map to another. To restart from a saved game, you can reload the cart and select \"Load Game\" from the menu. To start a new game, reload the cart and select \"New Game\".\r\n</p>\n<p>If your character dies, you'll be given the option to have the royal court \"resurrect\" your hero. This will pull you back to the castle and restore you to full health. You do not lose any game progress, xp, gold, etc., but you might have to travel back to the location where you were adventuring to continue your adventure. (Luckily, there are ways to move around quickly which you will find as you adventure.)\r\n</p>\r\nSupporting the Game\r\n<p>I'm not accepting donations on\u00a0<em>Ultimate Odyssey</em>. But if you'd still like to send some goodwill my way, consider picking up some of my other games, such as\u00a0<em>Welcome Aboard, Captain</em><em>, </em><em>Dungeon Hero</em><em>, </em><em>Expedition to Skull Island</em><em>, </em>or <em>Fable on Your Table</em>. All of these games share a focus on adventure and exploration, and are likely of interest to players who enjoy this game. Or, simply spread the word and help me drum up\u00a0interest in these games. Every little bit helps!</p>\n\n<p>Version History</p>\n<p>v1.1 - Initial release</p>\n<p>v1.2 - Software update to hopefully address some \"out of memory\" errors and to fix a bug that prevented you from leaving an oasis.</p><p>v1.3 - Fixes a bug that would hang when resurrecting before entering a town or the castle or other area. Also makes it so that when you get healed, it heals your stamina.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T10:58:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/810/81053834851f13055a49fbfc36decca1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lone Spelunker"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
