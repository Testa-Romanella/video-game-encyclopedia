Placing a line costs resources. If two lines cross each other, they form a rectangle. Rectangles generate resources.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to fill the game field with rectangles and reach the top right corner as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>Rectangles which were formed by two lines of complementary colors (e.g. blue and yellow) will produce more resources. Lines that hit each other at the very tip also form rectangles that produce more resources.</p>\n<p>Singutron was created as an entry for the Waltzing Game Jam 2 (2019).<br/>It incorporates two themes of the game jam:<br/>- Divide &amp; Conquer: Build lines (divide) to get rectangles (conquered area).<br/>- Symbiosis: Combine complementary colors to get more resources.</p>\n<p>Controls<br/>Left click: Build line<br/>Right click: Delete square (creative mode)<br/>Alt + Return: Toggle full screen<br/>F4: Toggle full screen<br/>F5: Toggle game UI<br/>F9: Toggle debug menu<br/>F10: Create screenshot<br/>Print: Create screenshot</p>\n<p>Singutron was created in a custom C++ engine using the following libraries:<br/>- Dear ImGui: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui<br/>- stb: https://github.com/nothings/stb<br/>- miniaudio: https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio<br/>- GLFW: https://www.glfw.org<br/>- GLM: https://glm.g-truc.net<br/>- Glad: https://glad.dav1d.de</p>\n<p>Asset files were used from:<br/>- Sound files: https://freesound.org<br/>- Font files: https://fonts.google.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T08:01:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb2504a96f9f496f93bd5c0c45712428.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["matfas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
