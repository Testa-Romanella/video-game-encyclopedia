Demonstrated here is the Vulkan Framework, and Window, Keyboard, Mouse, and Gamepad I/O. The project was up and running within a day, and some polishing was done for about two days after that. It's meant to be an example to prove that feature-full Vulkan apps can be written in a short timespan given the right tools for the job.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\nKeyboard and MouseGamepadControlW, A, S, D<br/>Left Analog Stick<br/>Move forwards, backwards, left, and right.<br/>SpaceRight TriggerMove upwards<br/>Left Control<br/>Left Trigger<br/>Move downwards<br/>Left/Right Arrows<br/>N/AMove in 4th dimension<br/>Left Mouse Button + Drag<br/>Right Analog Stick<br/>Rotate around the XY plane<br/>Right Mouse Button + Drag<br/>N/ARotate around the ZW plane<br/>FN/AToggle Tesseract Faces<br/>Pause BreakStartPause Tesseract rotation<br/>F11N/A<br/>Toggle FullscreenEscapeBackExit the program<br/>1N/AToggle Stereographic Mode<br/>QN/AReduce Stereographic eye width<br/>EN/AIncrease Stereographic eye widthVN/AToggle VSync (<em>default: on</em>)<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:39:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25c/25cbee0dadfd1621e68e9f652762a7d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Azure Indie"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
