Add your own!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nType the words as they appear on screen as fast as you can. When time's up you can see the results of your work in a quirky way. Each word you type also gives you points that can be spend to change the game up for the next time. If that's too easy the game has a hard mode that gives you more points for longer and more challenging words.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game also allows you to import characters that you can bundle up with the free version of unity, then drag and drop and play with whatever character you like. A tutorial on how to do this will be made available before release so make sure to follow if you want to be notified.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T04:21:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bb/0bb10f3c754e023c0d434d442b554a05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Britnet Media"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Britnet Media"], "esrb_rating": null}
