Then send your ants out and see what food they bring back! Click the dice to reroll your tiles if you're stuck.<br/><br/>Made for the Develop to Help jam, April 2022. Wanted to do a lot more with this but only had about 3 days of work in me unfortunately. Still, glad to take part!<br/><br/>FULL RULES:<br/>- Select a starting tile from the 3 in front of you<br/>- The timer starts now. Click on a new tile that matches the last one you clicked, either in colour, shape, or by how many ants are on it.<br/>- You can reroll your 3 tiles by clicking the dice<br/>- Points are scored by how many ants you can gather, 1 for each one printed on the tiles you select<br/>- Clicking tiles that don't match will incur a time penalty, as does rerolling all the tiles<br/>- Look out for special tiles that show up just below the main 3! These contain bonuses<br/>- No I did not have time to make a tutorial in the game itself....</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T14:40:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/092/0924813dcf918da9e1f551658d29bc51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["catslikeclouds"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
