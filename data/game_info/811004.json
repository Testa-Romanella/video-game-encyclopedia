I also have no prior code experience, unless HTML\u00a0 and CSS matters, so I heavily relied on some YouTube tutorials, some Reddit discussions, and the Godot documentation.\u00a0Lastly, my main motivation in finishing this was to let my younger sister play it, so I hope you enjoy it as much as she does.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>Graphics made on Inkscape.
