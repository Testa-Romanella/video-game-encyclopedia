Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff!<br />\nWidget Satchel is a daunting adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles and tricky platforming, but don&#39;t worry: You may lose some Widgets (or your socks!) along the way, but Sprocket can\u2019t get hurt and there is no \u201cgame over.\u201d Of course, it will take all of your ferret-y determination if you hope to stash away every Widget, discover every Trinket, and try on every pair of Socks!<br />\nWidgets: you want them! But beware, every widget you put in your satchel makes it heavier, making it a little bit harder to jump to the next platform or scramble past the station&#39;s maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if you don&#39;t collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill Sprocket\u2019s satchel.<br />\nYou&#39;ll reach special Fabricator rooms in each level, where you can exchange your Widgets for power-ups called Doohickeys. Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself with The Wrench and show them what&#39;s what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef&#39;s Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure, and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its secrets) however you like.<br />\nHigh scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you&#39;ll earn! What are mischief points? It&#39;s not important, but there are an awful lot of them!<br />\nOriginal soundtrack (by Sara Ferret) that dynamically reacts to your progress.<br />\nReplayable areas with &quot;metroidvania-lite&quot; pathing.<br />\nSock-exclusive inventory system.<br />\nTrapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate.<br />\nHuman characters to mildly inconvenience!<br />\nPiles and piles of junk!<br />\n...and more!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T11:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9af/9af5e81af4c1e62a5b4ad5220520db7a.jpg", "website": "http://widgetsatchel.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Noble Robot"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Noble Robot"], "esrb_rating": null}
