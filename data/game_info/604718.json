It simulates a MMORPG and many mechanics are based around a MMO design. This game may primarily appeal to those looking for nostalgia of old MMOs or RPGs from the early 2000s or before.</p>\n<p>Not everything is clearly outlined or explained, so many things must be discovered or explored by the player. I want to leave you with little guidance so that you can find the content entirely on your own, in a similar way that I experienced when I tried to tackle complex games without instructions in the past.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The main things you should know are the following:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>To <strong>save</strong> your content, you must return to the Town location and click the <strong>Save and Logout</strong> button. This is the only thing that will save your progress, including your characters data and all items.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you get into the main game, you can press Escape from the Town location to adjust volume and view basic controls.\r\n</p>\n<p>Lastly, there is hidden content in this game, I hope you get to uncover your own from your own path of play. If it seems that some content is never discovered, then I will eventually release information on the game directly so that players can experience this.\r\n</p>\n<p>Technical:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>General Details:\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was made in Unity 2019 over the course of 1.5 years with time on and off while completing college. It is entirely my own code outside of two small Unity marketplace plugins that are used. Assets used for sound and art\u00a0come from various locations including being made directly for the game, purchased from the asset store and humble bundle asset packs.</p>\n<p>For the download:\r\n</p>\n<p>I have two downloads available. There is a 1600 x 900 windowed version which will work well on 1080p and 1440p monitors (not recommended for 4k), the main benefits being able to close the game more freely or move the game to a second monitor. My other available download is a 1080p full screen version of the game which will work with many monitors 1080p and above.\r\n</p>\n<p>Select the corresponding download that will work best with your setup.\u00a0 The download will be to the installer which you can use to install the patcher to a location on your computer of your choosing. Launch the installed patcher to download the game. The download will\u00a0be at least 180MB. Once fully downloaded and patched on your machine, the game will be over 600MB in size.</p>\n<p>Game Performance:\r\n</p>\n<p>As a 2D game, I will be surprised if there are many machines that are unable to run this game. There are many mechanisms that are being checked independently during play that could be better optimized but I have had no major issues with any lag during testing done.\r\n</p>\n<p>One concern that was found is that with my save system, if you were to repeatedly save and load within one session, you are increasing memory requirements of the process by a significant amount until the program is closed and relaunched. I would recommend that when you save, you close the game and relaunch if your computer does not have much RAM.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the final days before release, instead of spending time adding, improving or balancing content, I have been solely focused on improving performance and fixing memory issues. I can now confidently say that I have resolved\u00a0the games performance issues as best as I am able. The lessons learned from this extensive process will be taken into my future work.</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<p>Music:\r\n</p>\n<p>Larry Collinsworth - https://soundcloud.com/larry-collinsworth\r\n</p>\n<p>Danae Dekker - https://danaedekker.com/\r\n</p>\n<p>Artwork:\r\n</p>\n<p>Alexandr Iwaac - https://www.artstation.com/iwaac\r\n</p>\n<p>Ruan Ming Ren - https://www.artstation.com/mingren\r\n</p>\n<p>Lucas Soares - https://www.artstation.com/lucassoaresca\r\n</p>\n<p>Ond\u0159ej \u0160pa\u0148hel - https://www.artstation.com/widoxx\r\n</p>\n<p>Design and Programming:\r\n</p>\n<p>Tyler Randolph\r\n</p>\n<p>---\r\n</p>\n<p>A big thank you to everyone else who goes uncredited and participated or supported in some form!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T06:52:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5b/e5b2d8bfa13875f62408337a7b901b90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lost Guardian Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
