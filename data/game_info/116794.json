You are the proud owner of your own Zoo!!!<br/><br/>The Bad News:<br/>Unfortunately, in our previous game The Great Zoo Escape 2 all the animals in the zoo escaped. Since then, teenagers have moved in and completely trashed the place. What a mess!! Not only have they made a mess, but they've also littered the zoo with BOOBY TRAPS!! And they keep adding more TRAPS every day!<br/><br/>The Really Bad News:<br/>You only have 1 week (7 days) to get the zoo cleaned up or the city will turn your zoo into a parking lot. Each day you'll be required to clean up a different type of garbage (metal, hazardous waste, recyclables, organic waste etc.)<br/><br/>This isn't your grandmother's hidden object game, it won't be a casual stroll through the zoo. So roll up your sleeves and help clean up over 100 hidden objects, just remember to watch out for all of the TRAPS!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd237c4c530fa235873254e303eb9ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sibling Rivalry Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
