Clicking a position in the screen will make the ball travel to that position in a straight line. You need to collect all golden orbs to win.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou lose the game by hitting barriers. They come in red, light blue, purple and green flavors.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBLUE - Standalone, stationary barriers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRED - Rotates around a parent barrier in a circular orbit.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGREEN - Moves along a defined path in a loop.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBLACK - Stationary, disappears when a certain orb is collected.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn some levels, you have orange colored purple orbiting around you.
