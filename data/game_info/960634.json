Stay behind cover and keep your foes at bay, while raining down a wide variety of spells to overcome the odds.<h3>Discover Shadowy Secrets</h3><br/>Meet a team of young wizards at the beginning of their magical education. Apprenticed to the most powerful sorcerer known to history, but stalked by mysterious enemies. Hardly having even begun, these magicians will have to contend with unexpected enemies and insidious dark magic.<h3>Build Your Spell Book</h3><br/>The main progression of MageCraft is in learning new spells for your team to wield in battle. Each wizard has their own specialization, and can gain increasingly powerful magic which they will need to take on the dangerous enemies the game presents. Balance the massive damage-dealing elemental magic with the strategic AoE nature spells or wield the power of time itself to give yourself an upper hand in combat! With many devastating spells available to acquire, you will always be finding new ways to outwit your enemy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-15T05:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b2/1b2ce4382b6823d529c131ecf052cc89.jpg", "website": "https://warsharkgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Warshark Games", "Mashup Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Warshark Games", "Mashup Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
