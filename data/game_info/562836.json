In this game you attempt to get your team onto the couch. The catch? You don't know anyone's names. Call names to determine who's who and then you can achieve a sweet victory royale, couch edition.\u00a0 You can play against a friend (assuming they are sitting next to you... and that you have any) or you can play against yourself. How many moves does it take to win? Enough reading, its a free game, what do you have to lose?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17f/17f45c0743268ecb8d6fcdc16194f5fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BmoneyDC"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
