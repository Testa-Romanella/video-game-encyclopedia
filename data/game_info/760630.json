Here, you must work with your crew, sending them to different parts of your ship to give you the power needed to carry on. As you go further, you encounter more enemies, each with different qualities which make them challenging. Although, you come across a shop, which sells you the equipment needed to face off against these foes, including more health, higher crewmate capacity, and more powerups. Defeat aliens, buy upgrades, and see how far you can get, in Rogue Space.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>- WASD to move.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Space to shoot.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Q to bring up crew menu, navigate with WASD.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Shift to boost, but only with 2+ crewmates on Movement.\r\n</p>\n<p>- E to dodge, but with 3+ crewmates on Movement.\r\n</p>\n<p>Music:\r\n</p>\n<p>- This game uses an original soundtrack created for the game, so there is no current link to any on the songs used as of now.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-28T05:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1da/1dad8fb16449a363d6938a88c0645d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrDoesHisHomeWork"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
