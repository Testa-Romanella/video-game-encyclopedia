Playing as a cute little tractor, your goal\u00a0is to mow down as many trees as possible. But there are also houses in the way that you will need to jump over to avoid. As you mow down more trees, more houses will be in your way, making it more challenging for you to avoid them. The terrain will also be steeper as more trees disappear, making it more challenging to move forward.</p>\n<p>The game features a simple gameplay loop and controls which makes it accessible for players of all ages. The\u00a0cute and vibrant visuals are also intentional in bringing an impact towards the message of climate change\u00a0as players reaches\u00a0the end of the game with the change in color and mood.\u00a0 Hope you enjoy the game and all feedback would be very much appreciated, all the best and\u00a0have fun! ^^</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Right and Left arrow keys: Move forward and Backwards</li><li>Spacebar: Jump</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Wan Jia Xing - Game Programmer</li><li>Chiang Jing An - Game Designer / Artist</li><li>Cedric Gan - Game / Sound Designer</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T12:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002e971ba0ae26ce6fa65e5bbf666d5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jax1808", "SteveJobless", "d4rkbluez"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
