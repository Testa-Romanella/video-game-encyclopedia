Defeating enemies, building devices, and completing objectives will earn you Valor points which can be used to bring powerful versions of your characters into the fray and help you turn the tide of battle!  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Tactically maneuver and control the battlefield by following the directions laid out by your Commander, controlling spawn towers, and utilizing the available siege devices to remove the enemy stronghold fortification layers. Gates, walls, and bridges can be destroyed to create choke points or new paths into the enemy keep, and alliances can be made or broken to swing the momentum of battle. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Create an eclectic roster of deeply tailored class-based characters, each with their own loadout of rarity-based and customizable equipment, skills, and talents, as well as emotes, and dance moves.
