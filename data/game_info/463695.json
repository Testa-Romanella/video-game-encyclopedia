That's why I\u00a0wanted to simulate it in my game jam project for the second ever Major Jam, which had the theme of love. This game was created in one week using Unity and a healthy helping of Youtube tutorial videos.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to update this game at a later point (after the jams voting process has ended) with some more content, such as new gift options, multiple partners, better QOL features, and other such things. Would you like to see that? Please comment below!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Click on your partner to gain \"Love Points\".</p>\n<p>Click on gifts and other shop options to purchase them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-10T06:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c9e0d9fb81eae41fe4a06ccef44a5d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Catbattle"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
