You have full control of him by using the right and left arrow keys or the A and D keys on the keyboard. You can also have him jump into the air with the space bar. Get close to the sheep and you'll automatically start eating.</p>Sheep\r\n<p>The sheep lived a simple life of grazing until Melvin came into the picture. Upon sensing Melvin they'll run away and fall off platforms if need be to avoid being eaten.</p>\n\n\r\nTraps\r\n<p>Traps will make it none too easy to acquire your next meal. You'll face two main traps.</p>\r\nShooting Trap\r\n<p>These guys shoot out spike balls that will hurt Melvin if he comes in contact with them. Avoid them at all costs.

The smashing trap\u00a0 smashes down fast and comes with added spikes so avoid running into these.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nHunger\r\n<p>If traps and plunging depths were not enough, Melvin is getting hungry and quickly. You must eat sheep to relieve your hunger.
