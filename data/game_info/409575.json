{"id": 409575, "slug": "pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous", "name": "Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous", "name_original": "Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous", "description": "<p>Embark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons in a new epic RPG from the creators of the critically acclaimed Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Explore the nature of good and evil, learn the true cost of power, and rise as a Mythic Hero capable of deeds beyond mortal expectations.<br />\nYour path will take you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have tried to withstand the threat coming from the portal and drive the enemy back, but to little avail. Now you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel backed by worthy paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else? Lead your army and challenge the mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will change the world \u2013 and you \u2013 forever.<br />\nCreate any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle.<br />\nEnjoy two combat modes to slay your enemies \u2013 real-time with pause or turn-based. Switch between them on the fly!<br />\nA cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead.<br />\nBut you will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of the demonic scourge. Take command of the crusaders and lead them to victory \u2013 either as a strategist controlling the battle from above, or as a field commander in a new tactical combat mode.<br />\nA gift of tremendous power has been given to you, and you must choose where this power will lead you. Take a step on one of eight Mythic Paths to obtain extraordinary abilities and shape everything that comes next. Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, or an ever-ravenous Swarm That Walks. The world will never be the same again.</p>", "metacritic": 81, "released": "2021-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-09T10:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a20/a203f3f5d667e04ce4a2c482c7be3a47.jpg", "website": "https://wrath.owlcatgames.com/", "rating": 4.21, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 113, "owned": 918, "beaten": 57, "toplay": 159, "dropped": 41, "playing": 27}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 187, "ratings_count": 108, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 110, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Owlcat Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["META Publishing", "Owlcat Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
