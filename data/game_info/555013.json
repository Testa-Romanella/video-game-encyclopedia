Also i know sadly when the speech bubbles appear it makes it more then 5 colour but i couldnt do anything about so hopefully thats ok as the rest of game is pretty much 4 colour, also this is quite simple and i wish i had the time to create more levels. Not much else to say then i hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T03:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/608142114c38045559e5456f31e7fec8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["somestufz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
