Im currently at the end of my conception. That means, some basic content is coming soon.</p>\n<p>My plan right now, is to push out updates every Sunday. Here is a rough roadmap for the current and coming weeks:</p>\r\n\r\nWeek 1: (done)\r\n    Basic Concept\r\nWeek 2: (current)\r\n    Chapter 1 Foundation\r\n    Create Maps\r\n        Basic encounters\r\n        Basic Functions and Events\r\nWeek 3:\r\n    Basic Class Concept\r\nWeek 4:\r\n    Create first class\r\n    Basic Skills\r\n    Basic Items\r\nWeek 5-X:\r\n    Further Classes\r\n    Some advanced Visual Map design\r\n\n\n<p>I'm currently <strong>planning</strong>\u00a0chapter 1, so here's what i am doing right now:<br/></p>\n<ol><li>A first basic town</li><li>3 Main Dungeon rooms</li><li>1 Boss room</li><li>1 Basic boss encounter</li><li>A couple of basic events</li></ol>\n<p>All of these things are going to be tweaked, polished and probably reworked, after i got all the other basic stuff done (especially the database). But for now everything will be raw content, without further depth.</p>\n<p>Since im using this project to <strong>learn</strong> more about <strong>Game Design</strong> and the <strong>RPG Maker (MV)</strong> the Game will start very simple. But im planning to implement more complex mechanics while progressing. So expect further stages to offer more depth.</p>\n<p>I'm probably going to experiment with styles and themes. So expect this game to be a well-ordered mess of mechanics and styles. I'll try to not overdo the themes and style stuff, but that may be a thing in this game. My current idea right now is to start with a friendly looking, <strong>ordinary</strong> <strong>medieval</strong> world, that is slowly <strong>shifting </strong>into a <strong>demonic</strong> <strong>nightmare</strong>.<br/></p>\n\r\nI will add a visitable test area soon. There you will be able to test out new NPC's, Shops and change your stats (Level, Gold etc.). You will also be able to test out items, that are in development or that didn't make it into the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas, tips or questions, please leave a comment\r\ndown below.\r\nIn the devlog you can see my further plans, ideas. I'll also\r\ntell you what im currently working on, if it's taking\r\nmore than a day.\r\nIn the future, i will add a second download.\r\nThis means, you will be able to play an experimental version,\r\nthat may have broken mechanics and other stuff\r\nand one version, with the fully playable chapter.\r\nBut that is probably going to take a while...\r\nSo, without further ado: Let's have fun together!\r\n\r\nBy the way.. If you want to take part in the development in any way, feel free to contact me via. Discord or the Comments. Im always open and thankful for some help :)\r\n\n<ul><li>Discord:\u00a0Helmut-Olaf Mauer#7964</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T08:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9b4a7028e72cbd40fd65f389d4fea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Helmut-OlafMauer"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
