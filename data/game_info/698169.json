{"id": 698169, "slug": "hospital-havoc-itch", "name": "Hospital Havoc (itch)", "name_original": "Hospital Havoc (itch)", "description": "<p>\u00a0\u00a0Hospital Havoc is a single-player puzzle game where you are a healthcare worker trying to clear all the patients in the ward. Click on the patients' cards to attend to them and utilise the different patients' characteristics to complete the puzzle before your energy is depleted!</p>\n<p>This game's objective is to challenge players to think flexibly to solve the puzzles we have set. The puzzle, especially in the later stages, requires players to plan ahead and manage their resources carefully. Through this, we hope to convey the message that working in the healthcare sector is complex and requires a lot of resource management; you are tasked to manage many patients and deal with their various eccentricities, all while making sure you do not burn yourself out.\u00a0 \u00a0We were inspired by card games such as Solitaire, for its single-player card puzzle game format, and Hearthstone, for the different types of cards we used in the game. However, we ended up taking a more intense puzzle-solving approach where only a limited set of steps could allow players to complete the game. We did this because we wanted to convey the tension in the healthcare sector, especially in the pandemic era.\u00a0 While our puzzles may be tough, the tasks the healthcare workers must juggle on a daily basis (and without a restart button) are much tougher. Appreciate our healthcare workers!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits!</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em><strong>Made by team\u00a0s\u00b3a</strong></em></li><li>Nicole Shiu \u2014 Designer</li><li>Shernice Leong \u2014 Artist</li><li>Kenneth Hong (https://knotstoks.itch.io) \u2014 Coder\r\n</li><li>Daniel Grace (https://wavepool-music.itch.io) \u2014\u00a0 Music/SFX\r\n</li><li>Sarah Laycock (https://iwazach.itch.io) \u2014 Artist /Coder\r\n</li><li>Nur Afiqah \u2014 UI\r\n</li><li>Shakthi \u2014 Artist</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Third party assets used</em></strong></li><li>Khurasan \u2014 Alpha Kind Font (https://www.dafont.com/alphakind.font)\r\n</li><li>Joe Letter\u00a0\u2014 Comic Shark Font (https://www.dafont.com/comic-shark.font)</li><li>Petrovv \u2014 Hospital Background https://www.dreamstime.com/hospital-beds-cabin-top-view-d-rendering-image100069170\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T06:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fa/0fac48573b233da09b0100ab05e273bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iwa", "knotstoks", "24getful", "Wavepool Music"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
