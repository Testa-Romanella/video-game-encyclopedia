{"id": 328524, "slug": "bloodseeker-bifflestein", "name": "Bloodseeker (Bifflestein)", "name_original": "Bloodseeker (Bifflestein)", "description": "<p>You play as a vampire count who has been resting in his coffin for a century after being wounded by a vampire hunter. When he awakens, the count\u00a0finds that\u00a0his three wives, the countesses, have claimed sections of the castle as their own in his absence. Your minions now serve them, and only stand in your way.</p>\n<p>The count also learns that the\u00a0vampire hunters have sealed away the castle to contain the evil within. The count is not yet powerful enough to break the seal, so he must track down the countesses and steal the power from their hearts to break free of his imprisonment. Once the count\u00a0is free, he will make those foolish humans suffer for nearly causing his demise.</p>\n\n<p>This is a little metroidvania game made in two weeks by Luke Pierson and Austen Kinney for the metroidvania game jam 4. During your adventure you can explore a castle featuring 6 areas and over 100 rooms, gain new abilities, fight a variety of enemies, and kill several bosses.
