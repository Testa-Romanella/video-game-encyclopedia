Maybe your push for more technology is going to lead to sudden unemployment as AI replaces jobs? Is pollution is now so bad that schools are warning children not to play outside? A famous celebrity getting car-jacked in broad daylight is a sign that crime is out of control! Other events may shake things up when you thought they were under control, such a sinking oil tanker, a collapse of the power grid or staggeringly cold winters. If you are fortunate, some random events may change your country for the better, such as a super-productive harvest, medical breakthrough or a breakthrough in trade talks.</p>\n<p>Give Democracy 4 a boost with these extra events to liven up the game. Will you still be able to maintain control of the country, and command the respect of the voters? or will your term in office be derailed by the tragic course of events!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ffc6ef43626d45ae01c33b5e0889804.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["cliffski"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
