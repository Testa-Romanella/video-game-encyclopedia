The game's main goal is to build an atmospheric horror with well-chosen audio and graphical style. This is not a\u00a0\u00a0survival or a thriller game where you have to run or killing enemies. This is more like a psychological horror game.\r\n</p>Estimated Gameplay Time: 30 minutes\r\nFull Release Notes\r\n<p>The game is out now!\u00a0 There has been done a lot of changes/ improvement to the game by listening to user feedback.
