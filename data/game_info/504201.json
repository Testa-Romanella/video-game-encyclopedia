The bugs rush towards the player, while firing corrosive bolts of plasma, who earns up points for each bug eliminated building a high score while preventing enemies reaching the surface and protecting their mech from enemy fire. When either the \u201chull integrity\u201d is reduced to 0, causing the mech to explode, or enough aliens escape to the surface of the planet, the game ends. </em></p>\n<p>Code - Swagonite, Evilhamsta, RedSkinnedDevil</p>\n<p>Art - Swagonite, I Would Like To Rage</p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sound - Evilhamsta</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e6278c181307496a9bea761c23d1808.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swagonite", "I Would Like To Rage", "Evilhamsta", "RedSkinnedDevil"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
