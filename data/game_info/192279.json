I don't know exactly where I'm gonna go with this but as of right now I am just implementing the basic survival aspects. I plan on this being a mmo type game where you can choose a faction (species of caveman) who each have certain abilities their good at and a class (hunter, shaman, ect.) But for now its a small test map and basic hunger, thirst, health. stamina, and temp bars (althought you cant actually drink or eat yet)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAllmightyDeveloper"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
