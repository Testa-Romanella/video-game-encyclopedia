I'd be clinging to the back that is slowly receding away into the distance. But the world isn't perfect...

Or so I hoped.</strong><br/>---</p>\n<p>Yuki is a pragmatic, reserved baker who took over his ailing Grandmother's shop. But when a decade-old mortgage goes wrong and a 'cutting-edge' construction project puts his livelihood at risk he has to somehow pull through and save everything that means anything to him. It doesn't help that he's also simultaneously caught between the newly hired waiter from the city and his ex who seems to have whooshed back into his life.</p>\n<p><strong>A light-hearted (probably unnecessarily drama-heavy) BL, featuring</strong><br/>&gt; A mellow Baker with abandonment issues, Yuki<br/>&gt; A sour delinquent type who wears too much leather, Souma.<br/>&gt; And a cinnamon roll who can't realistically believe the former two dated, Izumi.<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Sprite Art -\u00a0toxxic</li><li>CG Art-EmbraceOfDestiny</li><li>Proofreader-\u00a0Godline</li></ul><p>Update : A few typos were addressed.
