A virus with similar properties to SARS-CoV-2 is making its rounds in the otherwise idyllic town of Emojiville. As with SARS-CoV-2, the virus comes and goes in waves. It's up to the player to slow down its exponential spread and single out infectious persons in order to reach herd immunity, eliminate the virus and prevent as many deaths as possible.</p>\n<p>One of the goals of this game is to demonstrate the multiplicative power of wearing face masks and their role in keeping new infections to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Best played in full screen mode.
