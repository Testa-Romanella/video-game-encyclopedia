You need <strong>1500</strong>\u00a0points to win the game.</p>\n<p>However, there are enemies and obstacles. There are rocks that block your way and sharks that swim through the water with their only goal in life to take down your boat.</p>\n<p>Updates and bugfixes happen occasionally, so keep an eye out!</p>\n<p>Also, if you have any suggestions, maybe consider telling me! I would like to hear what y'all would like to see in the game.</p>\n<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT</em></strong>: This Scratch project was exported using the <em>TurboWarp Packager</em>. Because it's, well, a Scratch game, it's weird and because it auto-starts <strong>you have to interact with the game first so sound can work.</strong> The game may be buggy at time and if you detect any bugs please don't hesitate to tell me!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T07:09:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/22100a8eeaa484c1ad5b205c131a5b9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Wavemelon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
