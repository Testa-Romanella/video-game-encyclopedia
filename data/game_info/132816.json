(That, again, didn't even actually exist until we made it just now.) <br/><br/></p><p>This demo is for the 'JRPG-Style' spin off for a game series, that again, isn't real. It'll make more sense in time, I'm sure. <br/></p><p>In the meantime, enjoy this little demo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b93/b93ccc0da983a2b65b0bb73635a92a9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Filamena Young"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
