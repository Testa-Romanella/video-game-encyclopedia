The only \n      ones who can stop them are Clint, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter, and \n      Annie, a beautiful but deadly woman with a serious score to settle.\n    </p><p>\n      Blast your way through villainous outlaws, diabolical robots, and \n      towering, screen-filling bosses either by yourself or with a friend at \n      your side in the two-player co-op mode. You'll need a sharp eye and \n      quick-on-the-draw reflexes, but fortunately, you've got plenty of moves \n      to help you survive the hail of bullets heading your way. You can \n      dive-roll, jump, double jump, rope enemies with a lasso, and clear the \n      screen with explosive special attacks. Blast apart just about everything \n      in the environment to find guns, bombs, and other hidden power-ups. It's \n      up to you to bring justice back to town\u2014or whatever's left of it when \n      the gun smoke clears.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
