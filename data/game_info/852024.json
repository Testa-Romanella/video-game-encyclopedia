It was a series of speedrun-style platformers (all the originals are all now hacked, and deleted forever) created by me over a year ago. In this, you get original Adventure, Adventure 2, and the last Adventure game, the third one. Some abilities are unlockable in the shop. Everything from each game has been recreated from scratch, but are still very similar to the original games. But there is a special canceled Adventure game in here, and is only unlockable in the store: Adventure Arcade Edition! This version is automatically generated vertical scrolling platformer that goes on forever. Game saves are in the shop, as well as save reset.</p>\n<p>Warning! These games are kinda... bad..!</p>\n<p>Adventure series by me, title music (\"I Was Joking\") by David Fesliyan, graphics by me, code by me, sounds and other music by the Scratch Team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T17:40:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/910/910d4a94ccf9cc978633489e86ff15f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["imakestuffkid"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
