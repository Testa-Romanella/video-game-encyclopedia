This is because each unit has its own attack types and attack or heal ranges.\u00a0<br/>So it's good to care about the position of the unit when you place units in the puzzle part. In addition, you can use swaps to change their position in battle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You can use gold from puzzles and battles to upgrade your base and units in your squad.<br/>Base upgrades provide unlocking the merging list and adding the number of turns, previews, and swap.<br/>Units upgrades increase the unit's HP and ATK, giving you an advantage in battles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Survive from the endless monsters as long as you can with your squad you've grown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Brag your puzzle skill in this local multi-player mode.<br/>You can even play with your friends who don't have the game using Steam remote play.<br/><br/><br/>It's another land only for the challenge mode. Make a new squad, and complete from start to finish at one go. <br/><br/><br/>You can compete with other players with the defense mode score, etc.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-21T01:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1f/d1f79a59bf757c0452b33d76633afff1.jpg", "website": "http://magiccubegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magic Cube"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Magic Cube"], "esrb_rating": null}
