As for now \u201cCyberWar\u201d is a temporary name. Please be aware that much of this is in a raw stage and doesn't fully represent the final quality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you feel like playing, please give it a run, leave your feedback and thoughts - this will make me very happy.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Any feedback will be helpful in production and refining the game.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a multiplayer online game, playable on PC. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling a battle hovercraft. The objective is to destroy enemy troops and complete the mission either by destroying all hover vessels of the opposing team or capturing the enemy team's base. The player takes control of a single hovercraft of their choice, and enters the battle on a random level. The player has control over the hover (vessel) movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players through the chat. The goal is to survive and keep the human race from extinction, breaching into the heart of the enemy defense.</p>\n<p><strong>\u2022 Platform: PC<br/>\u2022 Genre: Action Game, Shooter<br/>\u2022 Multiplayer: multiplayer online game<br/>\u2022 Camera View: Third Person<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Discord Website Youtube</p>\n<p><strong>CyberWar server located in Google Cloud Datacenter in Finland.\u00a0Open for registration 24 hours a day.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Now it is time we take the next step.
