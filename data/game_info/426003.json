The next player to play the game will be a new survivor in the world you left, continuing your mission.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Play this game at https://journalgame.herokuapp.com in any browser. The primary controls are W/A/S/D and clicking on things.</p>\n<p>To use weapons, aim your character to where you want to attack/shoot and click on the weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Journal was created by Jonathan Scott for\u00a0<strong>Southampton Game Jam @ Home 2020</strong>.
