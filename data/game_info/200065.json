You must save the science in order to win the game. But be careful, there is only so much space in your truck to haul it back to the safety of the garage.</p>\n<p>The more you are carrying the slower you accelerate and if you are too full your max speed will be reduced as well. So it is best to to empty before you get too full. If you miss science, it will reduce your science score. If you hit -100%, you lose. Save 100% science and you win!</p>\n<p>You can tell how full you are to an extent by the color of your truck. Green is not full, Red is really full, Grey is completely full.</p>\n<p>I managed to get in one bonus item, it is the atom looking science that comes flying out. You can store up to 3 of these bonus items. Use the Shift key or Fire3 button on your controller to use the bonus. This will dart you back to the garage super fast. Very useful when you have a massive load. If you don\u2019t use your bonuses and capture more of them, you will get a large score bonus (not science bonus).</p>\n<p>Use the Left Ctrl key or Fire1 button on your controller to brake. Keep in mind though that you\u2019ll have to re-accelerate.</p>\n<p>Things I didn\u2019t get too:</p>\n<ul><li>High Scores</li><li>More bonus items</li><li>Actual monkey\u2019s throwing science.</li><li>Animated truck\u2026 He\u2019s a little static and boring, sorry.</li></ul>\n<p>There are probably a few bugs. I completed everything in the game myself and that is why you get terrible art assets :)</p>\n<p>I feel decently good about the sound this time around. The game itself is meeting most of what I expected to get to so I\u2019m pretty happy about that too.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying out DropBox for the Source and Executable this time around. I\u2019ll have source up soon. HTML5 in the works.</p>\n<p>Tools:</p>\n<ul><li>Unity</li><li>Paint.NET</li><li>Bosca Ceoil</li><li>BRFX</li><li>Audacity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/38d/38db13bd181e4ef2578ad154e1f52cdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Simple Potential"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
