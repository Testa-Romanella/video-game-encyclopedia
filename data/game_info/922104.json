If the root touches the rock, then the whole branch withers. Besides, the mole can eat the root and the branch can no longer grow. You have two tools: magnet and fire. The magnet tilts the direction of the main root. The fire stops the root branch it touches from growing. Use the mouse wheel to swap between tools.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T03:46:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/005/0059d7a4afec92b79e62ac04b9830ed5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Masik16u"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
