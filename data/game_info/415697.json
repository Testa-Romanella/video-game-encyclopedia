The planet is no longer inhabitable. The remnants of humanity are scattered on 5 space stations on the fringe of the solar system, where some of the best scientists are conducting experiments in pursuit of a \"cure\" that grants immunity to the Earth's harsh environment so humanity can once again return to their homeworld.</p>\n<p>You play as an experienced scientist who was just employed by an organization called A.R.K. A new spot recently opened up at one of their labs and you jump on the opportunity - but something is amiss. After a few weeks of working closely with some key members of the research facility, you begin to uncover the dark secrets hidden away in the depths of the station.</p>\n<p>Art by Kelly Lin (https://www.instagram.com/setokaibo/)</p>\n<p>Script by Kristy Lin and Sanaa Memon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T04:29:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/656/656dbfcf6769df4ac9c38da50b24fab9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OldFacedBaby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
