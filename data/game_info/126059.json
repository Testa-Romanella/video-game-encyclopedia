{"id": 126059, "slug": "radicals", "name": "Radicals!", "name_original": "Radicals!", "description": "<p>\r\n\t(quiz game for Linux Game Jam 2017) The goal was to very briefly introduce the idea of \"radical\" in written Chinese. The story setting is loosely based on the Yellow Turban Rebellion around year 193, particularly of a siege in Duchang, China.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe game was made using RenPy 6.99.12.4.2187\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t(The host of this GameJam tried version 1.0 of the game: https://youtu.be/_VA3NRd14I0?t=2h17m47s)\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nLatest Edition is 1.1\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTidbit: The game was meant to be made as a 2D non-scrolling platformer (but Godot was too difficult for me), where the player sprite moves around and respond to rebels as they capture different kinds of \"ration\"/power-ups and behave differently according to the meaning of the combined Chinese glyph. That animated presentation would be more intuitive to the player, instead of needing a mental image of what the enemy is doing. On the other hand, in the quiz format it would lose a little bit of challenge if I narrate what the enemy is doing during the choice screen.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nRegardless, thanks for playing. :)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/314337d20d40c02aa16d91993004ccc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["brushmen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
