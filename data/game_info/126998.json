{"id": 126998, "slug": "dropblock", "name": "DropBlock", "name_original": "DropBlock", "description": "<p>A game made in 48 hours for GMTK Jam. </p>\n<p>DropBlock\r\n is a small puzzle game where you ...drop blocks... to manipulate enemy \r\nmovements, as well as build up the level so that you can escape through\r\n the portal. <br/><br/>(Q and E rotate the camera. Sorry mobile, will fix later!)<br/></p>\n<p>I definitely did not get as much done as I wanted to within the time frame, and wanted to implement a scoring system where each turn the enemies left alive would generate score for you, giving you an incentive to keep enemies alive.\u00a0 As well as other obvious features such as improving the UI drastically, and adding animations to the player and enemy movements.<br/></p>\n<p>I plan on continuing development on the game for future release on mobile platforms and would appreciate any feedback given. Thanks for checking out the game page.</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/Andrew_LGN<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Font used:<br/>http://www.1001fonts.com/blox-brk-font.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cb/7cbcdc9621e5167bcc0b863e50905b90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AndrewLGN"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
