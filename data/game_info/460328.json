Things are made extra spicy by mixing in a screen wrapping mechanic, plus the sprouts pop up\u00a0blocks when you pass over to clear\u00a0them. All these ingredients are blended together by procedural generation, creating a slightly flawed but (hopefully) fun and a unique puzzling experience.</p>\n<p>Levels are very tiny, but don't be fooled, they can still be quite difficult at times.\u00a0There are 100,000,000 different\u00a0seeds to choose from, each containing 10 levels. Critiques, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome, though I'm crossing fingers, hoping\u00a0the game is good as is, haha.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>-</strong><br/>CREDITS:<br/>Entirely created by me (Micah), except for\u00a0ENDESGA's EN4 palette.<br/>Programs used: GameMaker Studio 2, FL Studio, Audacity, and Paint.NET.<br/><strong>-<br/></strong><br/>The game tells you the main controls (arrow keys and enter), but here's some extra functionality:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<em>INPUT</em><em>FUNCTION</em>CTRL+CCopy seed to clipboard.<br/>In menu --\u00a0Copies last seed.<br/>In level --\u00a0Copies current seed and level number.<br/><br/>(Note: The level number doesn't allow you to start at that level, as it's not part of the seed, it's only purpose is to let players take note of specific levels that they want to remember or share.)CTRL+VWhen on \"INPUT\" in the seed selection menu, you may paste text from the clipboard. Only numbers are kept, and anything beyond 8 characters is cut off.HOn level start or restart (before moving), pressing this will auto-solve the level.<br/>If you don't want it to complete the level entirely for you, just press 'R' to restart before it completes.<br/><br/>(Note: At first, I created this function for testing purposes, but I decided it made a better experience to leave it in.)WASDSame as 'ARROW KEYS'.SPACESame as 'ENTER'.ESCNot \"extra functionality\", but I\u00a0didn't mention it in-game, because I\u00a0thought it probably goes without saying, but this is an alternate way to\u00a0go back to a previous menu,\u00a0and it also\u00a0brings up the quit prompt in a level.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T06:10:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca3/ca32702614253e5179286595ec6813ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Micah DS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
