The endless\u00a0runner genre was hot at the time with the release of Canabalt and other games so I wanted in the game jam to make an endless vertical runner with a twist. <br/>Later, I decided to try to expand it and make a full flash game about it to sponsor which I managed to do in 2011. <br/>Later after the Egyptian revolution in 2011, a group of friends of mine asked me if I could skin the game to be for the Egyptian elections so\u00a0each person could select one of the hot candidates and try to get a higher score in the game as climbing a mountain was a metaphor for rising in popularity of the elections. The Arabic version is called \"\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a\" which means the chair (which is a metaphor for being the president and sitting on a throne).</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Arrows:</strong> Move the player while climbing<br/><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Jump in direction of the Movement\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T11:57:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/514/5141c0f180395898c7c26ee42b0eb6ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ahmed Khalifa"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
