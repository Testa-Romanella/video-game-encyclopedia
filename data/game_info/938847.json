I love how it begins, like poetry, skipping around in time. When done right, it's awesome, and I think it's done extremely well!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I also noticed a lot of it is animated, like the blinking eyes and the scene set-ups. Plus, it's very dynamic. I love the color schemes and the text box backgrounds.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not only all this, but you're really great at setting a sexy and/or mysterious mood. I really felt the romance at the table with Jayce. Even the voice acting is super on-point!\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The one thing I would most recommend changing are the menus. I say this because it's difficult to read the words or find the symbols I'm looking for. They're very artsy and pretty, but when I'm on a squinting scavenger hunt for the functions I want, it kinda takes away from that. But other than that, fantastic job! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you so much for letting me test it out. Good luck with the rest of development~ I can't wait to see the finished product :)\"\u00a0-<strong>Roxiano</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>I'm so happy you enjoyed the early version of the demo.
