At its core, the engine is a simulation of entities possessing a number of different components that represent their properties. One such property is the ability to emulate machine code assembled for the uxn fantasy architecture.</p>\n<p>The game is separated into a core engine and a modding layer that can be scripted in C. Check out the source code at its GitLab repository.<br/></p>\n<p>You can find out more about the uxn virtual machine at the xxiivv wiki, and a good place to familiarize yourself with programming it is the compudanzas uxn tutorial. However, you can jump right in without these at first, because some example assemblies and roms are already included in the downloads.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T13:20:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d6/2d6b6294f6e929c3d5b77a1e579c89e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux"], "developers": ["desertslug"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
