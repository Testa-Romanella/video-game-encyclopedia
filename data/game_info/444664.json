You\u2019re out sitting on your deck (the wooden kind) when termites, beavers, and other woodland creatures have come to claim back the wood they feel is rightfully theirs!<br/></p>\n<p>The objective is to construct a card deck that can consistently draw cards that will allow you to enhance your wooden deck\u2019s defenses. There are three different card types: weapons, deck pieces, and action cards.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~ use your mouse to squash bugs ~~</p>\n<p>Weapon cards are statically placed objects that will deal damage to and/or physically halt oncoming enemies (i.e. a flower that when attacked deals damage to that enemy, great for small enemies in large numbers).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deck pieces are passive upgrades to the wooden deck that can be used in-between enemy phases. (i.e. plant food that makes all flowers do more damage)</p>\n<p>Action cards can be used during enemy phases to act as trump cards and turn the tides of a particularly tough wave. (i.e. a buff card that can add health to a weapon, or a liquid nitrogen card that temporarily freezes all enemies)</p>\n<p>*Certain rare cards will only be useful if certain conditions are met, like the GMO action card that will combine all flowers into one giant flower fortress</p><p>~~ Deck's BUSTED!
