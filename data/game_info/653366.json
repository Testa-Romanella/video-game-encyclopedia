This game is rated 16+ due to some disturbing footages in it!</p>\n<p>Finally! We proudly present a game that was scrapped somewhere in 2015, so basically, this one was in development about 6 years.

Third Reich's highest command is planning an invasion to South America with the support of Argentinian military junta. Allied forces sent a small group of undercover agents to investigate a German embassy in Buenos-Aires. But something turned wrong - everyone was brutally murdered, except of a teenage girl named Armis Spherr. Now she is the only one who can complete this dangerous mission!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Key features:</p>\n<p>- the first video game about Argentinian 1943 Revolution</p>\n<p>- fight Junta soldiers and Reich's mercs in 6 action-packed levels</p>\n<p>- experience unique atmosphere of 40's Argentina</p>\n<p>This is some sort of a \"fan game\", so it can't be sold at any price.
