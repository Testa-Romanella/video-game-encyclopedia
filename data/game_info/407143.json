Smash it into bubbles at the right speed to rack up points and set highscores in 3 different modes.\r\n\r\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Red Bubbles</strong> can be hit while red. You get more points the harder you hit it.</p>\n<p><strong>White Bubbles</strong> need to be poked as softly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Blue Bubbles</strong> need to be hit multiple times while red.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Red Spikes</em></strong> can get you stuck in them. Pull your mouse away from them to get free.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Yellow Spikes</em></strong> kill you instantly.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>There are also 3 different gameplay modes you can choose from. You start with only one but you will unlock them quite quickly by just playing the game!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In <strong>Marathon </strong>you have to survive as long as possible while your life bar is draining with every second. You can refill it by hitting a bubble. How long can you keep up?</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In <strong>30 Seconds </strong>you have to get as many points as you can in a time of 30 Seconds while not dying.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In <strong>Racer</strong> you have to hit bubbles while they're falling down the screen. They get faster and faster, so reaction times are the key to success!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>As always, feedback and encouragement is greatly appreciated! Have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:35:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f90/f90f071ed6358ed7c3831d756a8b6cdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Prox"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
