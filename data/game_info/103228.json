Run across screen, jump over obsta\u00adcles, col\u00adlect trea\u00adsures through\u00adout a cursed pyra\u00admid, avoid trip\u00admines, lava pits and var\u00adi\u00adous deadly ene\u00admies (includ\u00ading bats, mum\u00admies, bugs, cobras) along the way.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor peo\u00adple who remem\u00adber the AMIGA game \u00bbRick Dan\u00adger\u00adous\u00ab, this game was def\u00adi\u00adnitely no inspi\u00adra\u00adtion.
