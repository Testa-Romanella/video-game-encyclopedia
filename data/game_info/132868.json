There is a health and stock system where the goal is to kill your opponent while the walls close in on you. Health can fluctuate as you land a successful parry or when disarming an opponent. There is a dodge roll and blocking feature while attacks are also direction based so there is a delay when turning your character. If you tap the attack button lightly you will do a quick attack, hold for a heavy attack. The game has a simple move set but a complex set of interactions which makes for an exciting and fun experience, Hope you enjoy playing our game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/303604cbc227034769804bcceee36307.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GlowLime Games"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
