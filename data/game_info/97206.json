Turns out it was a couple of older kids with masks trying to scare whoever was inside. I of course got terrified, thinking it was real monsters. This happened three years in a row, and ever since then\u00a0I cannot sleep without something covering the windows.</p>\n<p>This game was made to represent the fear I felt every time I walked close to a window during Halloween, and the relief of when I pulled down the blinds to finally be able to go to sleep. The final text tells you that you are forever cursed, and that is a reference to me not being able to sleep anymore without covered windows</p>\n<p><strong>Post Mortem:<br/>http://www.victorweidar.com/2017/09/30/halloween-preparations-post-mortem/</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>WASD - Walk<br/>Mouse - Look<br/>Left Mouse Button - Interact</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b19fe95cb32ef50326f8cae4a83c4001.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Victor Weidar"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
