Be prudent, some villagers can be captured or killed, so if you send too little of them the mission could fail.</p>\n<p>When they come back they'll be more hungry so keep a good look on your food reserves or they will starve and fight between themselves.</p>\n<p>If that happens you can feed them or send the bard to calm them. You will get another one each time you completed 3 quests. </p>\r\n Credits \r\n<p>Charlotte Fries</p>\n<p>Alexandre Zandecki</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5a/c5acab397bdc1e8f238c99116a2be1cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lethae"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
