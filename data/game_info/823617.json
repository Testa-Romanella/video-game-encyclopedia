Well now you can! Catch fish, earn money and upgrade your igloo and island, and maybe one day you will be able to fly!<br/><br/>As a penguin, you can buy all sorts of things to improve your igloo life, anywhere from a TV to watch your favourite penguin cartoons, to a wind farm on the outskirts of your island to earn extra money and energy (and maybe even a rocket to the moon, to prove that penguins can indeed fly, who knows!)<br/><br/>Buy all sorts of different renewable power stations, on a total of 8 different islands, to earn more and more money for your penguin. Team up with friends to quickly earn lots of money and buy hats to customize your penguin, or rank up your islands with the Penguin Bank. Do whatever you would do, as a penguin who could own 8 deserted islands.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T05:32:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c4/6c47e88bdde14f5613d2a6205ce78690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joseph Cook"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Joseph Cook"], "esrb_rating": null}
