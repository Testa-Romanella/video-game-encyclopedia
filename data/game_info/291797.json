Until one day, you fall mysteriously ill. Luckily, there's a wandering doctor in town, and not only have you always wanted to study medicine, but now you may not die tragically young!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only what happens when the doctor disappears just as you need him the most? The only logical explanation is to go find him! Wander out in the wide open world, all alone, with no direction, and only single-minded NPC's to help you find your way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is primarily an experiment on what happens when you take the concept of an expansive open-world game, and make it into a world where you only have one quest. It is about obsession and frustration, and runs (at max) a couple of hours (because a game entirely about unfulfilling struggle is only fun for so long).</p>\n\n<p>Made in RPGMaker MV.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/59d/59daaa9c142ad5cd8de047fe6e11d487.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Amanda Asofsky"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
