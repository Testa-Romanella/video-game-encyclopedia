The full game also contains french, spanish, german and italian translations.</strong></p>\n<p>Sqroma is a colorful puzzle game where you travel through 69 different levels with one goal each time: find your way to the exit. Each enemy you meet will have a defined color. Either you have the right color and you're friendly, or you don't and you're an enemy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this colorful world, you're the only one that can gather them all. Each color you pick up allows you to pass through every object of that color, such as enemies, bullets, mines, doors, you name it!<br/><br/><br/><br/>With unlimited lives and instant respawn, dying is not a problem. It even can be the solution! Your death usually means, fewer bullets to deal with, use that to transform the level!<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nKey Features\r\n<p>-69 handmade levels + 10 what-if version (demo : 15 levels)<br/>-42 challenges, you don't need to pass them all to finish the game<br/>-Use the physics of the game to find your solution, a lot of levels have multiple solutions. There's always one clean way out, but if you like that, you can try more obscure solutions.<br/>-The level does not reset after your current cube death, use it wisely to take a bullet for your future self and create a way out!<br/>-No time limit nor lives, take your time and how many tries you want<br/>-Want more? You find a solution to a puzzle, but was it the only one? The fastest? Each level has a time record to beat! But that's up to you, nothing is time locked!<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nAccessibility\r\n<p>-Color blind mode - doesn't work sadly for monochromacy<br/>-Slow time - possible to change for each level, if one feels too fast for you, just slow it down<br/>-Hint system - doesn't like to be stuck in a level and come back later? Just use the hint system for clues. But challenges will stay challenging! You don't need to pass them all to access the end of the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T09:07:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d3a55429f7bde1ebe397acb568effea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Woum"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
