The game is made with C++ and SFML, and it can be a bit buggy, because the code is a mess. But anyway, I hope you enjoy!<br/></p><p>My twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/AstronautenDev</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Your goal is to get as many points as possible. To gain points, you need to catch the white meteors. But be careful, <em>there's a twist</em>! If you don't have time to reach for one falling white meteor you'll lose one health. Also, if you touch the red meteors, you will lose one health.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The game was made by me, so all the art and code was made during the jam. However, I copied some of the code from my previous projects and used Bfxr to generate the sounds. Also the font was made by csanyk:\u00a0https://csanyk.itch.io/min-font\u00a0Also the cover image was made before the jam.</p>\n\n<p>If any problem occurs (the game crasher etc..) (I'm super sorry), leave a comment\u00a0I'll try to fix it. Keep in mind that this was made in 4 hours, so the code isn't perfect at all, and that bugs can occur. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T09:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/835112d0f7ac9edc0526c39cfc9002b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astronauten Dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
