Can you build and run the perfect metro station to help them make it on time?<br/><br/>Overcrowd is a tactical management sim set on the London Underground. Blending base building with pausable real-time strategy, Overcrowd offers a unique mix of spatial puzzling, strategic thinking and split-second choices.<br/><br/>Features:<ul><li>Detailed micro simulation &gt; emergent gameplay<br/>Everything from bin emptying, generator refueling, power, litter collection, commuter AI and staff activities are simulated down to the individual level. The huge range of interacting systems gives scope for emergent and unpredictable gameplay.<br/><br/></li><li>Procedural spatial puzzles<br/>Each level has procedurally generated terrain, offering a fresh spatial puzzle about which to design and run your station. With a choice of entrances and tracks, physical obstacles, and limited space and money, you'll have to weigh up your decisions carefully. <br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Unique multi-floor building<br/>Sculpt your station concourse down to 4 levels underground. Escalators and lifts are planned for Early Access.<br/><br/></li><li>Tactical staff deployment<br/>In Overcrowd you have direct control over your staff. You\u2019ll need to assemble a crack team, tool them up and deploy them to run your station in real time. You can also assign them multiple jobs with different priorities. Pausing the action by hitting space gives you time to react and plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Handmade isometric pixel art<br/>Overcrowd uses high res, handmade pixel art with no 3D engine shortcuts. View from four angles with high level zoom to see all the detail.<br/><br/></li><li>Heat signatures<br/>Anyone who\u2019s ever travelled on the tube in summer knows the heat can get out of control. Overcrowd models temperature and gives you thermoimaging, air con and fans to help keep your station cool.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Unique crowdflow mechanic<br/>Manage the flow of your commuters via station layout, user-defined directional signage or by ushering them with staff.<br/><br/></li><li>Unlocking, upgrading, expanding<br/>Unlock better equipment, shops and tools via the procurement (tech) tree.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Turning a profit<br/>Overcrowd features an economy driven by live commuter purchasing. Set shop prices and restock rates in order to make a profit and expand your station further.<br/><br/></li><li>Commuter AI<br/>Commuters respond to their surroundings: different environmental insults will affect them in different ways - making them angry, panicked, unhappy or even diseased. Everything that happens affects your station reputation.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li><li>Criminality<br/>Early Access will see a range of criminal behaviours introduced to commuters including theft and fare dodging. You will be able to use staff to incarcerate or eject law breakers.<br/><br/></li><li>Staff behaviour<br/>Your staff have needs too. Build a comfortable and well stocked staff room to keep them happy, rested and nourished. They also have skills and attributes which can be levelled up or improved through practice.<br/><br/></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-23T11:09:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c9/7c9e21ff3054a9593ca0d27f7d3f8024.jpg", "website": "http://overcrowd.co.uk/", "rating": 3.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 87, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 4, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 42, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squareplay Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squareplay Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
