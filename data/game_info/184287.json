A platform defense game, naturally.  Pop the balloons before they can make it to the exit, by jumping on them, squashing them against walls, or pushing them into each other.  Run around as fast as you like knowing that you're totally invincible, your only danger is letting balloons escape through those windows!</p>\n<p>Balloon Platform Defense is still in development, but get the Early Access version and start playing with the level editor straight away, and get new updates weekly.  You can also follow the progress of the game at our Facebook page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ae/4ae5492c37feb1db66c5e325ffcdd5b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["dph"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
