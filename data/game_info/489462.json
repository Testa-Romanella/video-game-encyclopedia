I was inspired by \"The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet\" by Becky\u00a0Chambers, one of my favourite books. In it, there is a mode of transport where people use a very small trip and wormholes to travel. I thought it would be interesting to explore what would happen if that trip went wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's very much not a \"Jump Scare\" horror, it's much more a \"That's such a bad situation\" horror. A sadder horror?\u00a0</p>\n<p>I didn't have\u00a0 as much time as I would have liked for this, so while the story is OK, I would have liked to add more to the presentation. I was able to use shaders, but I couldn't get rid of the jagged lines the shaders produced!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Ink Engine used to create the story</p>\n<p>Images from NASA</p>\n<p>Sounds: All from the Ultimate SFX Bundle from Sidearm Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T03:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aed/aed43bff7e31deaf5a7d4a0a58566e08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GreenClovers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
