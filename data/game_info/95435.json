You take the role of a cockroach named Bugsy who's friend Mayo got kidnapped by a monstrous Lizardman. However, a mysterious earthquake causes Bugsy to tumble into an underground network of tunnels before he was able to rescue her. Bugsy must search the caverns for a path to Lizardman's hideout to rescue his beloved Mayo, and all the while there are hints that something even greater lies below the surface...</p>\n\n<p>For returning players there are two new bosses, one is hidden in the swamp area at the end of the jungle, and the other one is Lizardman himself! Of the three bosses currently in the game, players with enough knowledge of the game's mechanics and layouts could beat each of the bosses in any order they like, but there is an obvious way trailing you to the 'correct' order.</p>\n\n<p>Other new features from last time include:</p>\n<p>(Hopefully) functional Hint System that points to you where to go.</p>\n<p>A couple extra tutorials to explain some less intuitive mechanics.</p>\n<p>A bee statue who grants you rewards for finding the hidden Golden Bee tokens.</p>\n<p>Difficulty modes that change the amount of enemies spawned.</p>\n<p>Lots of extra polish and QOL improvements from the last version.</p>=<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d8/8d82991a25b444ab0f4d1228752e1224.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mayo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
