(My goal is to release by Halloween 2020.)\u00a0Thus, I decided to create and submit a \"public beta\" to the I Can't Write Jam to 1) light a fire under my ass and 2) get some much needed\u00a0feedback.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>What's in this version?</strong><br/>As of Public Beta 1.0, this version includes part of\u00a0the intro with visuals.<br/></li><li><strong>Are there going to be more public betas?</strong><br/>Yes! I will continue to release public betas until the introduction is finished and there is at least one dating sequence.<br/></li><li><strong>Will the full version of Demonside be paid?</strong><br/>Yup, if everything goes according to plan! On release, the paid version will have fully colored pixel art, a full OST, \u00a0three dating segments, and four main endings. The free web demo will have fully colored pixel art and will end after the first dating segment. Price TBA on release.</li></ul>\n<p>Please leave any feedback you can\u00a0below!
