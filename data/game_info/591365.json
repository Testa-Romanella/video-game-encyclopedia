Will it be bug free ? Will your mind survive this experience better than mine ? So many questions that I hope you can answer for me !</p>\n<p>Good luck !</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0 movement is made using either WASD (qwerty), ZQSD (azerty) or the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Both mouse button are use to shoot : the left one triggers the machine-gun (autofire available if you hold down the button) while the right one launches a drones forward. It will pass through weaker enemies and attach itself do bigger ones, doing damage over time. You can call it back by pressing the right mouse button again, or wait until he's done killing its current prey.</p>\n<p>Escape closes the game.</p>\n<p>Hope you're going to have fun !!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:00:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/1125f5e842e0d18a8f3c3a6986df79ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Masaru_FR"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
