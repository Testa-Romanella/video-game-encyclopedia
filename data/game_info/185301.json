And purge him from this cleansed land. </p><p>There are 2 types of interactions :</p><p>1) Bonus objective : simply collect it and either have your hp restored or depleted by some % amount.</p><p>2) Combat : pick your attack type (Axe or Cucumber) and pick your defense type (Chair or Pan), your enemy will do the same. </p><p>Its similar to rock &amp; paper &amp; scissors. Here Chair neglects Axe attack, and Pan neglects Cucumber attack. After successfully killing enemy you will get level/xp, which results in increase of maxHP, attack, and will heal you for some random amount. </p><p><strong>YOU DON'T NEED TO FIGHT EACH NPC!</strong> while you are on low hp its better to avoid npc's and wait for bonus create to get healed. <strong>BOSS </strong>can appear at any moment of the game so if you are unlucky you will fail on your road to adventure and saving the world.</p><p>All code was written by me (nothing was copied from other projects/other sources). Assets used are mostly from Glitch asset public pack, except backGround which I made in graphic program. </p><p><strong>The whole game project was completed in exactly 3 hours : 02 minutes. Only small amount of  test's were performed that took several minutes of that Code time.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce6/ce6cdde2fa94dcfb48f5c2abe756923f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["dirindon"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
