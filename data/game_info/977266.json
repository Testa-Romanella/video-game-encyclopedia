Haven't you heard?! 'Summer Vacation' is reuniting for one last gig! I heard a rumour that they're playing this weekend, down at the local club. We just HAVE to go and see them!<br/><br/>The only trouble is none of the members want anything to do with each other anymore... Without anyone to play the club will never attract any customers...<br/><br/>It's up to you to rekindle old passions and reunite lost rhythms!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take part in this artistically diverse visual novel as you explore the new lives of each of the old band members, all whilst you convince each of them to return to the lime light! This game combines the unique talents of six passionate developers - each adding their own flare to the mix.  Each character has their own individual environments, art style and sound tracks tailored to their respective personalities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rhythm Reunion features 5 distinct characters, all made in a wholly unique style! Everything from artstyle, personality...Even their font is different! Talk to each of them and find out their interesting backstories, and try to convince them to rejoin 'Summer Vacation' for one last gig!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Psst...I've heard that InkForge Studios Director, Thomas Hunt, is featured in the game! Keep an eye out for him!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Every song for 'Rhythm Reunion' has been custom made by the incredibly talented composer 'Snosm'! Each character has a theme composed around their signature instrument! Once they all come together though, that's when the real show begins!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-23T04:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1ca2bc105291e178e99bdd744bb7fe9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["InkForge Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["InkForge Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
