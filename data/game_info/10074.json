Symptoms such as anxiety, increased heart rate and shivering will occur. Beware: this game isn't for the faint hearted!<br/><br/><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Seeking Evil: The Wendigo is a fast paced horror game. <br/><br/>You'll find yourself stranded in the creepy forests of North America. Things might seem peaceful, but don't be fooled as these grounds are cursed. You're not alone however since these haunted forests are home to a legendary creature called The Wendigo. This bloodthirsty predator is fast, smart, has great senses and will do everything it can to eat you alive. To break the curse you'll need to find and burn nine totems. <br/><br/>The more totems you manage to burn the more intense the game becomes. Therefore your best bet is to get from point A to point B as fast as possible, duck down to stay out of Wendigo's sight and use the ank to scan the environment for nearby totems.<br/><br/>Depending on how well you play an average run will range between 10 - 20 minutes. Simply sprinting until you find the totems will get you nowhere since the Wendigo will see and catch you.<br/><br/>In addition the game features a detailed highscore and has a smooth learning curve that allows you to step up your game.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>Controls for keyboard and <strong>non-vr</strong> controllers are really straight-forward, but how will Seeking Evil: The Wendigo be played in VR? Let\u2019s have a look:<br/><br/>For the best experience we advise you to play Seeking Evil while standing.<br/><br/>To ensure better gameplay and a more immersive experience Seeking Evil doesn't rely on a point teleportation system for locomotion and the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller are used.<br/><br/>In order to sprint you can press the trackpad (Vive) or the analog stick (Oculus) of the left controller. There will also be situations where you\u2019re chased by the Wendigo, here shaking the vr controllers as if you were running will allow you to increase your speed even more which might be a matter of life or death.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>The Wendigo is a savage predator that craves human flesh and prefers to eat its victims alive. It's cursed to roam the tribal grounds of North America and is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples. Although we don't know where it came from and descriptions can vary, one thing is certain: it is evil, cannibalistic, has an unending hunger and won't be satisfied after killing and consuming one victim.<br/><br/>This creature is intelligent, agile, possesses supernatural strength, has enhanced senses, and excels in stealth. The combination of these abilities allows it to stalk its victims without being noticed and once it has you in sight it's probably already too late.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-02T21:09:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/8952741624ce2d1b90e7762acc77a570.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 42, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Copybugpaste"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Copybugpaste"], "esrb_rating": null}
