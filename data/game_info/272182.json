That's why an experienced adventurer should always aim to get enough loot\u00a0from the adventure to pay the bills.</p>\n<p>But is that enough for you? Will you be satisfied\u00a0with simple\u00a0reasonable profit? Or do you want more?</p>\n<ul><li>Follow the leads the treasure hints are revealing.</li><li>Overcome many trials on the way.</li><li>Find four Shiny Gems and discover what's hidden behind the locked doors.</li></ul>\n\r\nEPOCHA TOWER\r\n<p>Dungeon Exploration Prototype was made in the pre-production phase\u00a0of the main project, The Epocha Tower. It is a proof of concept\u00a0with which we wanted to test creating\u00a0a top-down game focused solely\u00a0on exploration and nothing else.\r\n</p>\n<p>Even though the Epocha Tower will have enemies, RPG system, NPC's and more, the exploration will\u00a0play an important role present in all\u00a0the aspects of the\u00a0final game.\u00a0That's why we wanted to make\u00a0double sure we understand it well.</p>\n<p>Whether you liked it or not, rest assured the final product is already\u00a0considerably better, as this prototype served primarily as a learning experience.</p>\n\r\nTELL US EVERYTHING\u00a0\r\n<p>Do you wanna share your experience with us?\u00a0Are you interested to see how you did compared to others?\u00a0Or do you have a suggestion about what could make the game better?</p>\r\nTwitter\u00a0-\u00a0Discord\u00a0-\u00a0Forum\r\n<p>If you want to follow us on our journey, you can also do so\u00a0 by signing into our newsletter at:</p>\r\n\u00a0EpochaTower.com\r\n\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Game made by\u00a0<strong>Emil Ga\u0161parec</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0@pwMoti</p>\n<p>Music and Sound design by<strong>\u00a0Ben McCulloch</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0ben@benmcculloch.com</p>\n<p>The Guide created by:\u00a0<strong>Emil Ga\u0161parec</strong>\u00a0(@pwMoti)\u00a0and Zalost</p>\n\r\nTHE GUIDE\r\n<p>As a thank you for anyone who supported the project financially, I\u2019ve prepared a small token of gratitude. It\u2019s a guide for the dungeon.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The whole guide is written as a diary of an adventurer who visited the dungeon before the player. It contains additional lore bits and of course solutions to all of the main puzzles and secrets that are in the game.\u00a0It's not a 1:1 guide, as the dungeon deteriorated significantly\u00a0since the author of the diary visited it. It shows what needs to be done to get behind the final door, but leaves a lot of\u00a0freedom for your own exploration.\u00a0It's 9 pages long. The preview of it is in the screenshots.</p>\n<p>All the money will go into the production of the main project.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for your support.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e7/6e7541e6d56730ce92e5be3dbe44fc4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Please wait"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
