Each round will raise the challenge.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>WEAPONS<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Pistol: average speed, low damage and infinite ammo.<br/></p>\n<p>Assault Rifle: fast rate of fire and large magazine. Useful when dealing with a dense swarm.<br/></p>\n<p>Sniper rifle: slow but very powerful. The bullets will pierce through any amount of enemies.</p>\n<p>Missile launcher: high splash damage. It can destroy a whole swarm if aimed correctly, but don't shoot too close!<br/></p>\n<p>Flamethrower: flames will spread between flies. But be careful, as \"The only thing worse than a swarm of flies is a swarm of flaming flies.\"<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/></p>\r\nMove<br/>Arrow Keys<br/>AimMouseShootLeft Mouse Button<br/>ReloadR Key<br/>Select Weapon<br/>1 to 4 Keys<br/>Next Weapon<br/>Mouse Wheel<br/>\n\n<p>This project was originally created as a college project to showcase a flocking AI and later extended and polished.
