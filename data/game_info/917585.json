(unless i add new maps which most certainly\u00a0is the case at this point in time.)<br/></p>\n<p>My Goals with the game as of now(this may be updated):<br/>-Adding UI to support playing on phones.<br/>-Making the Timed mode available to play.<br/>-Adding enemies you have to jump on to kill, thus making you automatically jump forward aswell.<br/>-Adding breakable walls/doors/planks you can break with rolling.<br/>-With the two points above I can make way more variety to maps.<br/>-Connecting the game to a firebase to keep weekly scores and player accounts</p>\n<p>Feedback received from players so far</p>\n<ul><li>Add coyote jump</li><li>different jump heights depending on if you hold jump-key or not</li></ul>\n<p>My post on Godot discord:\u00a0https://discord.com/channels/212250894228652034/1067767445156270090<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>If you do play, feel free to put down your seed and record and also all kinds of feedback. Is it too easy, too hard, something doesnt make any sence, why did I do this or that or even have suggestions on what to add/change/remove to make the game better. Im solo developing the game and i use free assets from itch.io. <br/>I manage to develop atleast 2-3 hours a day as of right now.
