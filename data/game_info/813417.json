However, after a period of peace, two prominent scientists and industry leaders of robotics have gone rogue. They have destroyed plenty in their wake, and while they're on the run after their first strike was pushed back, the city is still in danger and it's up to Ferrum Man to apprehend them before they get away.</p>\r\nTrouble Running?\r\n<p>I've tried by best to make it run on web, but if it doesn't run even with shadows turned off and draw distance lowered, it may do so if you download the game instead.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Textures(beside titular character): ScreamingBrainStudios,\u00a0https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/tiny-texture-pack, https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/tiny-texture-pack-2.

This is my first game, and I realized too late that it wasn't that fun to play, nor easy to make it\u00a0as a solo dev. Not to say I'll never come back to the idea, but not for a long while, since I want to use my knowledge gained for my next game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T17:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d8/4d8566a4b4047ce6a92234124553d54c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Wierdox"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
