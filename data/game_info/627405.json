I apologize in advanced for any bugs in the game, we changed our idea like a day before the submission hehehe.</p><p>Programming was done by me and art by my friend Jonathan Morales.<br/></p><p>Objective:\u00a0</p><p>Keep dodging objects for as long as you can. If you're hit by one, the game resets<br/><br/></p><p>Controls: <br/></p><p>WS - Move foreward/ backwards</p><p>AD - Move Left/ Right</p><p>Q - \"Gravity Waves\" - this does not work as intended. It's supposed to make objects within a 10 m distance from you orbit your player at a 2m distance to shield you from other oncoming objects. Due to the constrained space the objects curve around you instead<br/></p><p>C - \"Time Warp\" - In order to mimic moving close to the speed of light, for 5 seconds the time scaling of the game is turned almost all the way down to mimic how time slows around object moving at the speed of light. This lets you slow down everything but retain your regular speed to avoid any sticky situations</p><p>If you liked the concept of the game, stay tuned. Unless we get too busy with life, start a new project, or keep doing different game jams, we might update the game regularly until it's a more fully fleshed out game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T11:28:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8c/b8c4b782f922e2f2ce4c6aaa52e13e20.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["YungKatsudon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
