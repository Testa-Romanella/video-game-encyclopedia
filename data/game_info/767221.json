(and other thankless sidequests)", "description": "<p>Chelsea is the princess of the (definitely real) kingdom of Lemuria. After journeying to the hamlet of Lunenberg and learning about the (definitely real) lizard terrorizing the local peasantry, she and her retinue take it upon themselves to end this menace for once and for all!</p>\n<p>Explore the town, talk to its inhabitants, unravel the plots of its various factions, complete menial errands, retrieve cut-rate treasure... This game's got it all!! (it's short, dumb, and moderately funny -- you should play it)</p>\n\n<p>Lunenberg is a deceptively active town. Despite being positioned well away from anything important, it still sports the all-important amenities such as the Inn, Shop, Castle, and Underground Dungeon. While there aren't too many monsters to fight (apart from the titular lizard), there are plenty of residents to talk to and sideplots to discover.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Chelsea</strong></p>\n<p>Definitely a princess and definitely not a runaway from a nearby farm. She has her heart set on fame and fortune, and nothing but the slaying of the most awesome beast around will slake her lust for glory. Finding some treasure would also be convenient, but her luck is terrible and it seems the only stuff she ever finds in treasure chests is expired snack food. Unfortunately her temper is a bit short and she is not above screwing with the hapless idiots that get in her way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kid</strong></p>\n<p>While the jury is still out on whether \"Kid\" is his name or just a descriptor, Kid has sworn himself to Chelsea's retinue and serves as her bodyguard. Of course, being half-grown, unarmed, and incredibly credulous, Kid isn't very well suited for bodyguard duty, but he'll make up for it in sheer pluck!! (maybe?)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gaza</strong></p>\n<p>While Gaza may only be 4 years old, this is still 28 in cat years, and enough for Gaza to proclaim himself the adult in the room. His level head and keen nose should prove valuable assets, provided he doesn't encounter catnip... or seafood... or yarn... or rodents... or birds...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous NPCs</strong></p>\n<p>In theory, they're a bunch of well-meaning townspeople with their own lives to lead. In practice, they're an annoying bunch with idiotic problems, cryptic hints, and zero survival instinct. Maybe Chelsea can bully some sense into them, but it seems unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>So what're you waiting for? The game is about an hour long and pretty easy to play. Good luck, have fun, and slay some lizards!</p>\n<p>Resources courtesy of Whitescrew store (http://hi79.web.fc2.com/).
