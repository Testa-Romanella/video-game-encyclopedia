Manage survivors, go on dangerous scavenging runs, build alliances, craft equipment, make difficult story-influencing decisions, defend your camp against undead hordes and experience non-linear rogue-lite elements. An innovative Indie Survival-RPG!\n<br/><br/>\nJust after the zombie outbreak you were fortunate enough to join a group of survivors and hole up in their camp.\nBut that doesn't set you out of danger! Food supplies are running low, injured survivors must be tended  to and materials need to be scavenged to keep the camp intact.\nThe zombie threat increases steadily and gangs of hostile survivors keep you on the defensive.\n\nDead Age 2\n10 years after the initial outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, the members of Jack's camp fled to Freedom City, where a cure for the zombie plague was developed. But the news brings more suffering than relief. New factions have sprung up in the region, in constant battle for dominance. The merciless Military, the shady Smugglers and the Independents made up primarily of civilians.\n<br/><br/>\nWhen an Independents' refugee camp was overrun by an undead horde, the few survivors struggle for food and valuable resources in an unforgiving world, always looking over their shoulder for gangs of looters and the flesh-eating dead.\n\nDead Age 2 Original Soundtrack\n\"The apocalyptic atmosphere of the Dead Age 2 soundtrack comes from the depths of my heart, creating longing atmospheres, coupled with a feeling of hope and darkness at once. The sound of minor chords always was my favorite. The special part about this soundtrack is the pairing of modern sounds and beats, which support the battle scenes and give them even more depth. Every single track tells its own story. If you want to join this journey, take your headphones and listen with closed eyes...\" \n-- Sven Gerlach, composer of the Dead Age 2 soundtrack\n<br/>\n<p>Languages, features and system requirements may vary between games - please check individual product pages for details.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T01:52:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/274/274d29b926bbb675e4ab4ca1695704e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 491, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Silent Dreams"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Headup Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
