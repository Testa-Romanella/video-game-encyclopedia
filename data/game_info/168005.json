Your objective: to impress her with your sick roller derby skills!<br/></p>\n<p>\r\nIt's best played when not in full screen mode to avoid confusion of the meter during the rhythm game portions.\u00a0\r\nThanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Also feel free to comment with feedback/bugs down below!! ( because I'm not perfect at making games especially when there's deadlines to meet)</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>- If you go to the pattern list screen and back to the game it'll will mute the sound for a few moments.<br/></p>\n<p>- If you skip the intro the narrative portion after the first level glitches for the first line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0-After making your first choice option during the narrative portion, you need to press return to continue. No text displays at first if you don't hit return.</p>\n\n<p><em>This game is work in progress and this is the current demo for it.\u00a0 &gt;v&gt;;;; I originally had a more lengthy narrative portion but had to cut it since I'm putting\u00a0cooleg portfolio. I'll update it with the actually dialogue I originally had once I like fix the other two levels since I originally had three and now I only have one since that song works the best :^)</em><br/></p>\n<p>P.S. I made all the songs in Logic Pro X but like two of them are short covers of 70s songs. Specifically Boogie Nights(in the title screen) and A Night to Remember ( in the first level)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/159d4b8db5cfe2c16887b277da1983c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gensuta"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
