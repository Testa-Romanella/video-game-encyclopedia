I fixed a few bugs and did a bit for game balance. Also removed most of Edgar Allan Poe's poem because I felt there was too much text to read.  <br/>* the pre-battle conversation is super-rushed, but it's basically a conversation between a Hamadryad and her tree, who has used artificial means to extend its life. Her life force is tied to the tree's, so it's definitively a \"final\" boss. Hopefully not too pretentious. :-) <br/><br/>Controls: <br/>gamepad (Xbox) <br/>control stick - move left/right, down to drop through platforms <br/>(A) button - jump, double jump, advance screens <br/>right trigger - fire <br/><br/>keyboard <br/>directional arrows - move left/right, down to drop through platforms <br/>space - jump, double jump, advance screens <br/>left ctrl - fire <br/><br/>Credits: <br/>by Mike Cullingham <br/><br/>Music - \"Starlight\" by DL Sounds (http://www.dl-sounds.com/) <br/>Sounds <br/>- \"tap\" by adcbicycle (https://freesound.org/people/adcbicycle/sounds/139...) <br/>- \"Pop!\" by kwahmah_02 (https://freesound.org/people/kwahmah_02/sounds/260...) <br/>- \"Barrel Break 1\" by kevinkace (https://freesound.org/people/kevinkace/sounds/6676...) <br/>- \"Acide_Laura BEGUET M1 Sc\u00e9nar\" by univ_lyon3 (https://freesound.org/people/univ_lyon3/sounds/201...) <br/><br/>Tools: <br/>GameMaker Studio <br/>Gimp <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd722a380494cd7d92134318a03d7ee4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mike_cullingham"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
