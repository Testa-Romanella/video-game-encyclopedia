The theme for the jam was <strong>Growth</strong>. The time limit was <strong>48 hours</strong>. This is a <strong>solo entry</strong>.\r\n </p>\r\nNote<p>My PC decided today was a good day to start overheating and crashing a bunch, so I wasn't able to implement everything I had planned (mainly some more visuals to represent the flower actually growing and some more variation in the finale). I still think the game came out alright. <strong>Solo game development is hard</strong><br/></p>Credits\r\n<ul><li>Game Design: me \r\n</li><li>Code: me \r\n</li><li>Music: me \r\n</li><li>Sounds: me \r\n</li><li>Art: me\r\n</li><li>Voice: I'll\u00a0give\u00a0you\u00a0three\u00a0guesses\u00a0who\u00a0that\u00a0could\u00a0be...</li></ul>\r\nLinks\r\n<ul><li>My channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Od4iYshEhNFfgUCRr0ccA\r\n</li><li>You can find and download all my music here: https://agentjo.newgrounds.com/\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9d/b9d71a910b06b6897e34bf1e22a3bbae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Agent_Jo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
