I wanted to focus on coding my own text adventure, basically from scratch, which is why there isn't as much story as I would have liked. I am not a proficient coder. But I did my best and I'm proud of how much I was able to get done.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll check out my game. If you could give me\u00a0any feedback, or point out\u00a0typos, and bugs you may come across, that would be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>I do have plans to try and continue this, if just to practice my coding some more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T08:03:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/679/6794ed08b904e1cb1c14f272d4b099d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["VictoriaPotts"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
