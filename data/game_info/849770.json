Brutally difficult, Unforgiving, with one hit Deaths and wave after wave of enemy fodder, it's not a game for the faint of heart, only true old skool shmup veterans will survive the onlsaught!<br/><br/>But there's\u00a0 a twist...<br/><br/>You control two ships simultaneously. One an aircraft the other a submersible. The sub mirrors the jets controls, so if the jet moves left the sub moves right! Only the sub can attack sea targets and only the jet can attack air targets! This is a holdover from the theme of the epic mega jam for 2022 'as above so below'.<br/><br/>So not only must you master the waves of incoming enemies, dodge obstacles and return fire but also manage a second ship with mirrored controls making for an intense, fast paced cereberal experience where you need not only lightning reflexes to dodge and return fire but spread your attention over two seperate ships!<br/><br/>The game originally started life as my Epic Mega Jam Entry for 2022, I spent a few weeks and fleshed it out, overhauled the graphics and thus present: Schmuzzler, So named for being half puzzle half Shmup!<br/><br/>-8 Total Levels in the current Alpha Build<br/>-4 Levels<br/>-4 Boss Fights<br/>-4 Different Power ups per ship (including Rapid Fire, Homing and Laser weapons!)<br/>- Themed enemies to its level theme (Aliens in the alien levels, pirates in the ocean levels etc)<br/>- 2 Player local co op (One player uses controller one uses keyboard)<br/>- Convoluted and Unneccesary story elements<br/>-UI and theme designed to hark back to 8 and 16 bit style shooters<br/>-Epic Music<br/>-Save High Scores<br/><br/>Free Demo available covering the first two levels with multiplayer disabled.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T07:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b7224badfb1c857008d48f41f50bab4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GrumpyMunkyIndy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
