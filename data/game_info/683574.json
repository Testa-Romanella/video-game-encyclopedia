Humanity has long since ceased to exist and left only one thing behind - robots, and quite a few of them. But how are they controlled, and how are new ones being made over and over again? Through the almighty AI. It controls everything and everyone, with only one exception. A robot has managed to develop its own personality and has found that the AI may not be as good as all of its comrades around it keep saying. So he made it his business to do this AI once and for all and create a better world for the new robot population. You have to help the robot to overthrow the AI, while dodging enemies and solve several puzzles throughout the level.</p>\n\n\n<p>2d Art: Lucy, Angelin<br/>3d Art: Mark<br/>programming: Jonas, Moritz<br/>supported by: Alex</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T05:10:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b8/8b835aeba5df19b39cace6a43bc2a3ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toasted Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
