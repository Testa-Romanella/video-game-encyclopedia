I often have it stuck in my head that my work is too lousy to be enjoyed, so for the most part I don't post 80% of the music, art, and creations I make or dabble in,\u00a0\u00a0but I'm still really proud of myself for being able to try my hand at game making, so this is the start of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I usually just do music, and a little art, but\u00a0I do plan to make more installments like this in Visual Novel format, but maybe when I'm braver I can try other engines and gameplay styles</p>\n<p>This is currently a demo! There may be bugs, typos and other\u00a0things that may need tweaking in this version. It doesn't have all the features I'd like to have in it, and currently there is only one ending, but I plan to finish this game in the month of April!</p>\n\n\r\nOTHER INFO\r\n<p>This was made during the NaNoRen0 2023 game jam!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music &amp; Sound Design made with FL Studios</p>\n<p>Art made with Procreate</p>\n<p>Game made with Tyrannobuilder</p>\n<p>Music, Sound Design, Art, Story by me!\u00a0</p>\n\r\n\r\nCONTENT WARNING\r\n<p>Disclaimer: Not all of these warnings are currently present in the demo version but will be present in the full version.\r\n</p>\n<p>~Suggestive humor\r\n</p>\n<p>~Disturbing imagery\r\n</p>\n<p>~A little blood</p>\n<p>~Very mild body horror\r\n</p>\n<p>~Trypophobic elements [Fear/disgust of\u00a0holes]</p>\n\n<p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>page is still under construction</p>\n<p>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS AND UPLOADING A GAME FILE LIKE THIS, IF I MESSED IT UP LET ME KNOW DFGHJHJKJHJH</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T17:44:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa8/aa81359551a0cf0cfb6af8e60238a293.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Starriko Works"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
