There\u2019s a hot tub. You\u2019re hanging out in it. Someone new arrives. You know them a little bit, maybe you got introduced earlier in the night? They seem cool. Really cool. You have something you want from them, or something you want to do with them. But you don\u2019t want to actually have to ask: whether you never make first moves, or you always make first moves and you\u2019re tired of it - wouldn\u2019t it be nice if <em>they</em> asked <em>you</em>?</p>\n<p>This LARP was originally written to be played in an actual hot tub, although it could be played in any space where two people can speak to each other. This is a short, GM-less game for two players. Recommended Print and Play, cutting each character sheet in half. Alternatively, grab a full page and choose which of the two characters you would like to play.</p>\n<p>Content Note: Light romance/crushes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T11:09:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c40677358c6bfae93bcbdfa26843ba06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nellquinngibney"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
