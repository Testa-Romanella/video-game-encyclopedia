FEUP students, ravaged by mountains of content to study and deadlines without end, inhabit the walls of their faculty. It is up to you to help them pull through (and maybe also grab a tuna mayo baguette at the cafeteria).</strong></p>\n\r\nManual\r\nGoal of the game\r\n<p>Survive the waves of students and collect money to reach the highest score!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Movement is performed with <strong>WASD or\u00a0</strong><strong>Arrow </strong>keys</li><li>\"Attack\" using the <strong>RMB</strong></li><li>Aim with your <strong>Mouse</strong></li><li>Swap between the 2 worktools with the\u00a0<strong>Scroll Wheel</strong></li></ul>\r\nWorktools\r\n<p>For the worktools at your disposal, you have the <strong>Research Paper\u00a0</strong>and the\u00a0<strong>Coffee\u00a0Cup</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Research Paper functions like a melee weapon, swinging and swatting enemies, knocking them back and dealing damage at a short range.</p>\n<p>The Coffee Cup shoots coffee balls in the direction you're aiming, for a longer range but less impactful hit.</p>\r\nStudents\r\n<p>Throughout your journey through the B hall, you will encounter different types of students.</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong> - do I need to say anything else?</p>\n<p><strong>Sleepyheads</strong> - these sluggish students never got their morning coffee and just want a cup of your brew. They wander around, hunting for a fix.\u00a0And nothing stands between a student and their coffee.</p>\n<p><strong>Researchers</strong> - who said dissertations were all fun and games? Writing and rewriting and rewriting is not only frustrating, but very wasteful of paper sheets. These students like to keep their distance to focus on their tasks, but throw their drafts\u00a0all over the faculty\u00a0halls.</p>\r\nPowerups\r\n<p>Aside from money, students seldom drop powerups that will aid you in your quest for baguettes.</p>\n<p>The <strong>PC Charger\u00a0</strong>will energize you, speeding up your movement to close that precious gap between you and those pesky\u00a0Researchers.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>Meta Analysis on Core and Arm Strength\u00a0</strong>will give you a breakthrough on how to swing that Research Paper much harder.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>Stevia Packet</strong> will make your coffee pack a bigger punch, with no artificial sweeteners but all of the flavor\u2122.</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>Take the first few encounters as an opportunity to get familiar with the controls and gameplay. It\u00a0<strong>will</strong> get more difficult over time!</p>\n<p>If you get hit, don't panic! You'll have a grace period of invincibility afterwards which can get you out of rough situations.</p>\n<p>Try not to get cornered, and use the Research Paper to carve a safe path through the horde.</p>\n<p>Make use of the powerups while you have them!\u00a0Mobility and DPS are very valuable.</p>\n<p>Watch out for those paper balls! They can sneak up on you when you're not paying attention.</p>\r\nDevelopment Process Highlights\r\n<p>We went through various iterations of the code structure as we evolved in our experience with: Godot features and best practices; game programming patterns and coding for future extension; difficulties and solutions for development struggles.</p>\n<p>A lot of time was invested designing and solidifying visual communication: color palette, silhouettes, theming and visual clarity.</p>\n<p>Usage of Godot Nodes and Scenes allowed and will allow for generalization and recycling of game elements.</p>\n<p>We developed the features following a sensible order of priorities - core features, then visuals, then add-ons and game feel/quality of life tweaks.</p>\r\nOwnership\r\nResources\r\n<p>All the resources in the project were created by Joana Mesquita and can be found in the file <strong>\"assets.rar\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>They are free to use and modify for non-commercial purposes and with proper attribution under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) Creative Commons license.</p>\r\nDeveloper (Group Members) Information\r\n<p>- Joana Teixeira Mesquita, up201907878</p>\n<p>- Jo\u00e3o Ferreira Baltazar, up201905616</p>\r\nDownload Instructions\r\n<p>-\u00a0Download the \"<strong>Exam Season.exe\"\u00a0</strong>file and the<strong>\u00a0\"Exam Season.pck\"\u00a0\u00a0</strong>file\u00a0and keep them in the same folder, then open the executable to start playing .</p>\n<p>OR\r\n</p>\n<p>- Download the \"<strong>DDJD-PP-G13-Exam Season-game.rar\"\u00a0</strong>file, unzip it and open the executable inside to start playing.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T22:41:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b66ee01ec9e4eaca48209da42f5991b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joana Mesquita", "jfbaltazar"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
