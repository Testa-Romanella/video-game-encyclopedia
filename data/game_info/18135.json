But Ionball 2: Ionstorm brings a lot of new things to this genre.</p>\n<h3>Innovations in the classic genre</h3>\n<p>First of all, these are 3D environments. In a three-dimensional environment, the obligatory attributes of the genre are perceived in a new way: explosions, shooting, and other visual effects.</p>\n<p>There are 60 levels in all. Three of them are required to defeat the boss at the end. You fight with bosses and hordes of other enemies, using 7 uniquely destructive weapons.</p>\n<h3>Story and gameplay</h3>\n<p>Robots took the place of bricks in the game, and the whole situation of the game was made in the sci-fi style of space travel and space battles. Classic gameplay remains the same.</p>\n<h3>Soundtrack</h3>\n<p>The dup-step style soundtrack helps to keep the rhythm and react to events in the game with sufficient speed.</p>", "metacritic": 70, "released": "2014-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:51:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da6/da6383e05fff7ee4ca44caf173a21201.jpg", "website": "http://www.ironsunstudios.co.uk", "rating": 1.97, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 42, "owned": 1108, "beaten": 4, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 36, "suggestions_count": 480, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 36, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ironsun Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Kiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
