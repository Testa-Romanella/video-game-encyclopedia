What happened here, what want so terribly wrong, and why is it that within this building's walls you can see into the past?\u00a0The answers lie in a sealed chamber at the other end of the facility, but the path is blocked by the consequences of some long ago disaster. To make it through, you'll have to go back in time to before the crisis and take control of the lab's systems to change the course of events, creating ripples that will echo down the timeline and open doors for your future self.</p>\n<p>Controls - WASD to move in the present, scroll wheel to move in the past. Use the mouse to manipulate systems in the past.</p>\n<p>Press \"T\" to switch between times.</p>\n<p>Note - due to a minor error at the last moment player will spawn in the third chamber instead of the first. To play the whole game, work your way backward to the first chamber. My apologies for the error.
