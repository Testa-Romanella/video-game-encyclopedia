{"id": 879695, "slug": "tetrisweeper-blockmath_2048", "name": "Tetrisweeper (blockMath_2048)", "name_original": "Tetrisweeper (blockMath_2048)", "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted both Tetris\u00a0<em>and</em> Minesweeper?</p>\n<p>Well, here it is. (This isn't the first; kertisjones made one about two years ago, you can find it\u00a0here. Props to him for inspiration for the finer details and mechanics. Also, the music on his is way better than mine.)</p>\n<p>In order to clear a row, as in Tetris, you have to fill it with pieces,\u00a0<em>and</em> correctly solve (reveal or flag) all the tiles in that row. You lose if you either\u00a0reveal a square with a mine, or the pieces reach the top of the board.\u00a0Combo lines (i.e. singles, doubles, triples, and tetrises) are only reset when a new piece is placed, so it's possible to get 5-line or even higher clears.\u00a0High scores are saved locally; Customizable options include mine density, randomizer (7-bag, 9-bag, or random), and volume controls.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>A / D: Move piece left/right.</p>\n<p>Q / E: Rotate piece left/right.</p>\n<p>S: Drop the piece faster.</p>\n<p>W: Hold the piece.</p>\n<p>P: Open the pause menu. When in the pause menu, W/S moves the cursor up and down, A/D edit the selected option, and Q/E executes the option. (Note: P does not unpause the game - you need to select \"Resume\" on the pause menu.)</p>\n<p>Left-click to mark a tile as safe.</p>\n<p>Right click to flag or unflag a tile.</p>\n\n<p>FAQ:</p>\n<p>Q: Why did you make this if\u00a0kertisjones already made one?</p>\n<p>A: I didn't realize he made a version of this until about halfway through making this. I also added scoring and options, and the rotation doesn't glitch out after clearing a line. (He did make it first, so if you want to support him instead, go right ahead!)</p>\n\n<p>Q: How does the scoring system work?</p>\n<p>A: Each line cleared gives points for how many lines you've cleared in a row without a new piece landing. The first line gives 100 points. The full table looks like this:</p>\n<p>Streak\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Points</p>\n<p>1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+100</p>\n<p>2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+300</p>\n<p>3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+600</p>\n<p>4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+1500</p>\n<p>5+\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 +2000</p>\n\n<p>Q: Will this be updated?</p>\n<p>A: Yes! This will be updated every so often. For v2 I'm planning on adding global leaderboards and more customizable options. (No ETA yet.)</p>\n\n<p>Q: Who made the music? Can I use it?</p>\n<p>A: I did! Played live.
