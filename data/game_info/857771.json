Discover a world packed with puzzles, enemies, bosses, and treasure. Join forces with fellow heroes to hunt down the gods, or strike out alone and be the first to discover uncharted territory. Become <strong>Mythic</strong>.<br/><br/>There are no pay-to-win microtransactions in Mythic - and there never will be. This is something very important to us.<h3>MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER</h3><ul><li>Fully online. Enter a massively multiplayer experience with up to hundreds of people on your screen at any given time.<br/></li><li>Choose your party. Navigate the world alone, with a few friends, or with anyone you meet along the way.<br/></li><li>Build your character.
