Doomed to become an advertising mascot until his <em>actual </em>retirement from the workforce, Rodger's PR agent catapults him into the world of speed-dating in (somewhat) fancy pizzerias. </p><p>Will Rodger Hyena find love in this horridly-named venue, or will he be condemned to a life of loneliness?</p><p>Warning: Contains a lot of purple prose, horrid puns, and a dash of <em>double entendres</em>. Best enjoyed with a hearty serving of the greasiest pizza you can find.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55b/55bf1ae35cbec2635257eca9dd7f1e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elusive Lollygaggers"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
