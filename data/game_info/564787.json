Before that I never had even thought about making games so except for programming, image- and sound editing I had to learn everything on how to make games from scratch, which of course makes this game far from what I would consider good. I'll probably add more stuff like more and smarter enemies/more levels/more variety in traps/general improvements once I learn how to do that stuff.<br/>Thanks for reading :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T02:14:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b71/b711d0f2ba66e7b1783e678dba160386.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cook I.T!"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
