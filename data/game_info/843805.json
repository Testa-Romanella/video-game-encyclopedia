No more evidence in the house was found. No traces to where the family went. Case 13 is another dead end. I managed to upload a copy of the video before the FBI got to it. I need to see what they don't want us to.</p>\n\n\n<p>SIGN OFF.\u00a0 OFC Jack R. Macklemore</p>\n\n<p>Submitted to the Brackey's game jam 2022, Theme: You're not alone.
