Build small hamlets, soaring cathedrals, canal networks, or sky cities on stils. Block by block.</p>\n<p>No goal. No real gameplay. Just plenty of building and plenty of beauty. That&#39;s it.</p>\n<p>Townscaper is an experimental passion project. More of a toy than a game. Pick colors from the palette, plop down colored blocks of house on the irregular grid, and watch Townscaper&#39;s underlying algorithm automatically turn those blocks into cute little houses, arches, stairways, bridges and lush backyards, depending on their configuration.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-15T20:14:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ae3/ae336267c9dfa6732f66619b375ce0af.jpg", "website": "https://rawfury.com/games/townscaper/", "rating": 3.72, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 28, "owned": 1296, "beaten": 102, "toplay": 56, "dropped": 113, "playing": 23}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 190, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 191, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Raw Fury", "Oskar St\u00e5lberg"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Raw Fury", "Oskar St\u00e5lberg"], "esrb_rating": null}
