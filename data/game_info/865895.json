Your chance for fame. The\u00a0experience of a lifetime. At the start it all seemed pretty cool, but after a while\u00a0something seemed somehow off. You knew that weird stuff would happen on the show\u00a0\u2013 set up by Big Brother to create drama. But this is stranger. You\u2019re no longer sure\u00a0what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t. Something impossible is loose in the house, and now\u00a0</em><em>you\u2019re trapped in here with it.</em></p>\n<p>This is a multi-player video journaling game. All the scenes in the game are\u00a0conversations in the diary room where you tell Big Brother about what has\u00a0been happening and how it\u2019s making you feel. All of the drama in the house\u00a0takes place off-screen, implied by the things you and the other housemates\u00a0say in the diary room. Prompted by random card draws, you invent and\u00a0describe the events in the house. The other players can respond to what\u00a0you say in your diary room sessions, imagining their character\u2019s\u00a0perspective on what happened or inventing new events in the house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the game goes on, some sort of unnatural weirdness will begin to seep\u00a0in. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll get evicted before it gets really bad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:42:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a6/6a60636c2c483b49839f1f2370b9dafb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Armada Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
