Also, you're a hamster and will collect all the cheese you can on the way.</p>\n<p>This is a game I worked on for months, trying all kinds of things (most of them not featured in this version), but never got to a point that it was good enough to release it commercially. So I eventually moved to other projects, though it still holds a special place in my heart and I do want to come back and finish it, eventually. Unfortunately the code is a real mess and I would have to rewrite it from scratch. But maybe, some day I'll find the time, because I still think it's quite fun and the Chris' graphics look amazing!<br/></p>\n<p>Info:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Use your Boost and the planets gravity to navigate your ship</li><li>But watch out: Boosting heats the engines!</li><li>Overheated engines need to cool down before they can be used again</li><li>Collect all satellites in a level to find the wormhole</li><li>Fly into the wormhole to get to the next level</li><li>Collect Cheese to score</li><li>You have 3 lives</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Game by Dr. Hackenstein</li><li>Graphics by Chris Mauck</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Click/Tap on Boost to boost</li><li>F to toggle Fullscreen</li><li>1/2/3 to Change Camera Perspectives</li><li>ESC to Restart Game or Quit</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:11:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618294464c78bea3b5f42811ddffdbac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Hypnotic Owl", "dr.hackenstein"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
