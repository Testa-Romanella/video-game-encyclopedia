The controls of this game are relatively simple: point and click. You can click on any partner to select them. Once selected click either on empty ground around them to make them travel there, or click on an enemy so they will target the enemy. After using one of the ability buttons it will go on a cooldown for some time.\u00a0</p>\r\nCredit\r\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0Art - Me<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0All new code - Me</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0* BULKYPIX font - Copyright \u00a91999 Smoking Drum<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0* Music - Tallbeard Studios (itch.io),\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://tallbeard.itch.io/music-loop-bundle<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.abstractionmusic.com/<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Main Menu song: Abstraction track 10</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Pick your Partner scene-song: Abstraction track 2</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 &gt; Battle scene-song: Abstraction track 9</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 *\u00a0SFX - Kenny Assets (Digital Sounds + UI Sounds)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:54:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35e/35e2e39fa303ea67a4a057bd1939701d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Sephta"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
