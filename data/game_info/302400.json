I would have liked to add a shooting mechanic and more enemies and obstacles but due to time constraints this was not possible</p><p>Outer Space - the whole story was of a little guy that crash lands on an alien planet. I was hoping to have him visit several planets... but again time constraints.</p><p>Energetic - this was the inspiration for the character himself. I really wanted the energy to come through in the character design and animations and I think I succeeded in doing that.</p><p>Cartoony Sounds - I knew I needed to create a primitive but diverse sound system for this so I wrote a script that deals with all the sounds in the game. The sound manager generates variations in all the sound effects so that the sounds don't get repetitive and boring. I also threw in a dynamic music system that responds to the players actions in the game. I think I will be using this system in all my unity games from now on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-18T02:09:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06d/06ddd83dd55a65a419f70f6841b4f588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Super8BitRafa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
