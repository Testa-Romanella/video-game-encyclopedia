Play against the clock and plan fast, or turn on casual mode and take your time. Or for an even greater challenge design the best defences you can before you\u00a0face off against an endless onslaught in Endless mode.</p>\n<p>Change the path enemies follow by swapping (A) and rotating (B)\u00a0 tiles. Direct them towards your defensive programs, the fast firing laser, the powerful but short ranged teslacoil and the dominating beam canon.</p>\n<p>Gain maximum points for quickly dispatching enemies, but beware letting them escape as your hard won points will quickly disappear.</p>\n<p>Only had time for one randomly generated level, waves build in size and speed, and you gain defenses as you progress.</p>\n<p>In endless mode you start with all your programs and must build the perfect defense before unleashing a never ending assault.</p>\n<p>Speed up gameplay with the overclock option, and give yourself a breather between waves by enabling casual mode in the menu.</p>\n<p>Entry for GBJAM 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>A to swap tiles.
