When you jump into the game, you'll need to figure out how to use all the available bricks (which are scattered around the\u00a0island), to <strong>build a powerful plane </strong>able to explore the other asteroids. There are <strong>11 treasure</strong>s to be collected and you can find\u00a0<strong>maps </strong>which point you to them. To find the maps, you'll have to explore, keep your eyes open for anything that looks 'interesting'.</p>\n<p><strong>A little background if you're interested:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Asteroid Search</em> is the third iteration on an exploration game I've been wanting to make for a long time.</p>\n<p>In its current state, this really is a prototype, in which I have temporarily let go of both the detailed terrain (as seen here) and fact that the world was\u00a0endless and procedural. I\u00a0did this because the gameplay was lacking and I\u00a0really loved the lego-like crafting mechanic in <em>Astroneer</em>.</p>\n<p>So the world, the 'lego bricks', the visuals, the limited sound,\u00a0it's all placeholder really, I\u00a0focussed on the gameplay and while it's mostly a relaxing, exploration game, if you do everything right you can find all 11 treasures in under an hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Basically any 3D model you see that isn't a tree or a rock or a cube is by <em>Joram van Loenen</em>.</p>\n<p>The sounds and effects are free assets from the asset store by\u00a0<em>Little Robot Sound Factory</em> and by <em>Electrodynamics</em>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c47/c47ff82979c6c19a7842142f5c257384.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Stijn Raaijmakers"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
