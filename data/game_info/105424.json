We wanted to see what it'd be like to make a twine game in UE4, and this is the end result. This game was made as our final year university project, so it's just a small slice to showcase what we wanted to make! We have more ideas and we'd love to expand the game in the future! But for now we really hope you enjoy what you see and play!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Update: !Secrets No.1!<br/></strong>There are some new features, mostly some new secrets that are hidden throughout the levels. The main big thing added was a text system, that appears when looking at some objects! But play it in full screen, as otherwise the text won't appear on screen. You won't miss anything vital though. We've taken out QR codes for the minute, but they may be added back in at a later date! </p>\n<p>Leave a comment, or you can tweet either of us @benjodurbin (words &amp; engine stuff) or @leafykayo (art &amp; pretty stuff). </p>\n<p>Did you enjoy our game? It'd be pretty cool if you could support us, and future stuff we make!</p>\n<p>All of the sound was sourced from Freesound, under the CC0 license and edited in Audacity.</p>\n<p>This game contains flashing images.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>You probably wanna play with a mouse and keyboard,<br/>controllers still work but only partially.</p>\n<p>Mouse - Looking<br/>Right Mouse Button - Intense Looking<br/>WASD - Moving<br/>Shift + WASD - Intense Moving<br/>E - Touching<br/>R - Start Over<br/>Esc - Escape! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/884d2764ddf6a675ed1be2e13e69794e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["theRatWives"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
