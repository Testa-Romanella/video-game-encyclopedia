Play as \"Pajama Girl\", a talented entrepreneur and technologist who wakes up one morning in her midtown-Manhattan apartment to discover that an experiment gone wrong has transformed her into a LEGO minifigure. Try to piece together the events leading up to your transformation and attempt to reverse the process!</p>\n<p>The game features a number of story-driven objectives split across two levels (both showing New York City from a minifigure's perspective), as well as numerous \"easter eggs\" for the consummate LEGO fan. Both levels feature an \"easy mode\" toggle for novice players who still want to experience the whole story.</p><p>Originally featured in the \"Unity x LEGO Microgame Build Your Own Game\" challenge on LEGO Ideas.
