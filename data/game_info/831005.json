The bone acts like a key and must be found and collected before the door to the next level opens.</p>\n<p>Currently there are only 3 levels, no menu- or endscreen, but we'll get to that. If you still want to make the most out of it, there are a total of\u00a039 coins to collect.. good luck finding them!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W, A, D and Space - left, right and jump</p>\n<p>F - interact with doors</p>\n\n<p>If you have thoughts about the game, please share them in the comments, as we are using this engine the first time, we'ld like to improve our techniques from the start on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T13:14:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea2/ea2fdf689e07b8b71cda189f446cf397.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ShyXe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
