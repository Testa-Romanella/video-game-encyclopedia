Sound effects were mostly sourced from this Humble Bundle with minor edits, everything else was created for the jam. My runs range mostly from 2 to 6 minutes if I'm lucky, but the quickest run is technically under 40 seconds (Sorry if this is cheeky). This was a lot of fun, and I hope you enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Controls are:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 Keyboard:</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 WASD to Move, hold W to climb ladder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mouse to aim, Left click to strike with your weird wrench.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Shift to sprint.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ctrl to crouch (Downloadable).
