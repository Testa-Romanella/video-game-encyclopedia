The game is my first game jam, and also my first time utilizing Godot Engine. I usually use Unity so this was an entire learning process for me, and it worked out to be a great experience! Collect ammo dropped by enemies, and dodge them and try to kill as many as you can. Leave how many ghost's you've killed in the comments!</p>\n<p>I hope you will all enjoy this short arcade game.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T10:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f9/0f926d414678456f2b6e83d0fae31f67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Broderick"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
