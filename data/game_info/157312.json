I love playing the Saxophone and this song reminds me of playing every time I hear it.  I picked the instrumental version of the song to use because I want to emphasize the beauty of the Saxophone.  The beauty of the music and the beauty of the scene go hand in hand here.</p><p>The poem is a Haiku that I created for this assignment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["julianMG"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
