Now we're offering it to all of you completely free. It's a turn-based, comedy RPG set in a vast open world and plenty of extra side quests to find. It's sure to give you a few good laughs and quite a few hours of gameplay. You might even find a few new friends on your journey. Windows only.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-22T02:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87d/87d661a5e6a1098d891c68eac9094c9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Digital Meltdown"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
