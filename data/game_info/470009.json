With no medical experience and a craving for causing <strong>chaos</strong>, you can choose to fix up your patient or\u00a0<em>fight a chair, die in a closet, harass your coworkers, vandalize\u00a0the building, commit murder, leave early, access your manager's\u00a0laptop and much more</em>!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You get 5 days to make or break this medical clinic. And in this demo,<strong> you have access to day one</strong>.\u00a0After being in development for over a month, the demo is finally here!\u00a0</p>\n<p>A quick warning before you play: this is my very first attempt at coding or making a game, ever. I'm still in high school, so don't expect gold. I poured my heart into this thing, so hopefully you'll have a good experience.</p>\n<p>You can contact me at\u00a0doinkadoink#0969 on discord.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-17T06:46:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/083/0832227b47a61fb538bb0a4b32244752.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["doinkadoink"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
