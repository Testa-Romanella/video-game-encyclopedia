A cellular automaton is a grid of cells where each cell is updated according to the states of its neighbors. The most famous is Conway's Game of Life, but this app supports many others as well.</p><p>There are two versions: the demo only offers access to a few rules, such as Conway's Game of Life and Wireworld. The full version has about a dozen more CA rules and also lets you create custom rules.</p><p>This project is still under development, and I plan to add more features like a better UI, saving/loading, and the ability to create more complex CA rules.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/441/44119fb77421ae94cd909ba5ba01b318.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nathan Stoddard"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
