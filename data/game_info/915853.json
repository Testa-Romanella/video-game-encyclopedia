It\u2019s not an exercise but bitter seriousness and their teacher Mrs. Green is trapped in a different room. Now Tom and his friend Anna have to make it out of the building to the playground and bring their entire class to the assembly point. On their way, they must not lose any time and have to overcome many different challenges represented as minigames. For example finding the coolest and therefore safest door out of three or the fastest way through the classroom represented as a maze without being distracted by all the candy lying around. When they manage to get to the assembly point safely they can finally call the firefighters, at least if the player knows the correct number. As soon as the fire brigade arrives with squealing tires, they start to extinguish the fire and finally manage to free the trapped teacher. Tom and his friends are heroes. But this can only happen if the player is able to complete all the mini games in time and takes the correct decisions. Mistakes either lead to a game over and restart when they directly affect Tom or to a bad ending, where the children weren\u2019t able to save Mrs. Green and everyone is sad. This will also result in a restart.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T11:57:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d51/d5152b5411649124755b045d142ed873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lisa Mueller"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
