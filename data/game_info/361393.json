Wanting to avoid simply making a non-rhythmical 'Crypt of the Necrodancer' I opted to make it somewhat more action focused. I believe there are a number of other ways I could have achieved it, but I settled on this being an option that I\u00a0could realistically implement into a game of sorts within the allotted 48 hours, since I was working alone, and this is my first ever game jam!</p>\n<p>Hopefully you enjoy the result. I personally think it's a bit clunky, but fun enough to play a few rounds of! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:25:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f2/1f29d1e397a0009f567586b027130620.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phanttas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
