Your task is simple: to get as far as you can and to survive as long as possible from vicious mortars and murderous machine gun fire. Keep firing to force your enemies to take cover. This makes it harder for them to hit you or your comrades.</p><p>Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move. Left Mouse Button or CTRL to fire.</p><p>This is an exercise project I made a couple of years ago, but didn't have time or knowledge to publish back then. Now I feel it's time to bring the game to the public.</p><p>Music used:</p><p>Tension and Resolve - Mike Byrne</p><p>Rise to Glory - Mike Byrne</p><p>Both tracks are released under Creative Commons by Attribution.</p><p>http://michaelpbyrne.wix.com/music</p><p>Contact:</p><p>If you have any questions, suggestions or constructive critique, feel free to reach out to me through my email: z.agge@hotmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/269/26900df6d7bf61076b23fa578f187242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Z.agge"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
