Collect pickups, avoid obstacles and grow your tail.<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------Orby Information---------------------------</p>\n<p>Orby<br/> is a skill based game about collecting pickups. Orby moves around <br/>either clockwise or anticlockwise based on game mode. You must collect <br/>the required number of pickups on a level while avoiding your tail and <br/>obstacles to win. Some game modes also have time limits and either <br/>collecting a pickup or completing a tail extends your time. Running out <br/>of time is Game Over. This is explained in further detail in the <br/>tutorial. </p>\n<p>Orby has 3 unique game modes. Challenge, Tail++ and Classic. </p>\n<p>--<br/> Challenge mode is for the truly skilled Orby player. Each level you <br/>complete is a real achievement and grants you bragging rights, <br/>naturally. </p>\n<p>-- Tail++ is a time attack mode. Complete a tail <br/>and earn more time but after each completed tail you'll need to collect <br/>one more pickup. Your Tail++ scores are posted to Google Play <br/>leaderboards. </p>\n<p>-- Classic mode is calmer in comparison to <br/>Challenge and Tail++ and can be used to practice to your orbing skills. <br/>This mode ends once you have picked up your 50th tail piece. Scoring is <br/>based on how long it took you to collect 50 pickups. Your Classic scores<br/> are posted to Google Play leaderboards. </p>\n<p>------------------------------Orby Controls-----------------------------<br/> <br/>Steer<br/> Orby with one touch controls, holding down on screen to expand Orby's <br/>orbit and releasing your touch to decrease Orby's orbit.
