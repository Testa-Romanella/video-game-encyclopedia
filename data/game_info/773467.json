{"id": 773467, "slug": "infinite-treasure", "name": "Infinite Treasure", "name_original": "Infinite Treasure", "description": "<p>You're on a treasure hunt, but this is no ordinary world. This world is procedurally generated by mathematics and will never end, no matter how long you scroll for. Like the map, the treasure is endless too. You just need to be fast (and lucky!) enough to find everything you need.<br/><br/>Levels have 5 types of treasure to collect and each have a unique theme. Some treasure is more rare than others so keep an eye out!<br/><br/>There are two ways to play this game:<br/>1. Relax Mode: relax and pass the time by completing sets of treasure with no time limit. Progress is automatically saved<br/>2. Challenge Mode: test your speed and precision to get the highest score in 2 minutes. Increase your score multiplier by collecting treasure faster and by not missing your target<br/><br/>As an extra challenge, can you find any of the ultra-rare Mythic items in Relax Mode?<br/><br/>This game is still in a proof-of-concept phase - most of the graphics and sounds are placeholders while it's being play-tested. \"Infinite treasure hunt\" is the concept - I need your help to refine it into a fun game. My goal is to expand a set of levels, each with its own unique theme. Let me know what features and changes you would like to see - I would love to hear from you!<br/><br/>For feedback and support, please contact James at infinitetreasureapp@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T14:24:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/637/6378178d1c39803a8a1686621d66efc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamesBrill"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
