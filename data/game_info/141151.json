Silly little game that needs your whole attention, both hands and fast reaction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> Move the elevator with the <strong>arrow keys</strong> and collect tourists with <strong>1</strong>,<strong>2</strong>,<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong>&amp;<strong>5</strong>. The number represents the slot of the queue, 5 being the slot next to the elevator doors. Pressing <strong>Space</strong> will unload the passengers on the correct floor. Delivering three passengers simultaneously gives you a hefty bonus, that's the way to go\u00a0:)</p>\n<p>The idea for this game came to me in a dream, in which i had to program an elevator. Made in 2015 while learning to program in java using javaFX.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/3330287ffcd9b435a8a4b35f08a95471.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["evilco"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
