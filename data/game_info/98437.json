I, Mighty, being as generous as I am powerful, elected to create a happy people to inhabit my world. However, as time passed, they split into various savage tribes. Ignoring my teachings, they instead prayed for trivial concerns and ill will to their neighbors as they fought an endless and pointless struggle to wipe each other from existence.</p><p>At first it was amusing, but eventually I had to act or my genius creation would destroy itself. Fueled by their offerings pillaged from their wars, I used my power for placing trees, raising mountains, even reaching down to physically drag them apart. I vowed to keep them apart at all costs until they could evolve to reach the enlightenment I had envisioned for them.</p><p>I, Omnipotent Mighty, will not accept failure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6a7/6a71e4ef87933edb7720660197e5d963.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["maksch", "BricksterJohn", "Grinless"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
