(3D Platformer)", "description": "<p><strong>Modifications:</strong></p>\n<p>1. New title!\u00a0I called it \"Mission: Maze!\" in honor of my new level.</p>\n<p>2. New soundtrack! I created a completely new and original\u00a0soundtrack for the game using Ableton Live. I attached a screenshot of me editing the song which involves 7 different instrument/audio tracks!\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. New level - maze! I created a completely new (and very large) level for the player to traverse. It is a large maze where the player must find the keycard and then the corresponding door while navigating the maze and fighting off enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. New Player Death Effect! I added new particle effects to the player death using the techniques discussed in the tutorial and exploring more. The new effect is kind of like greyish purple smoke, and a burst of fading health ticks. I thought this looked cool as if the player was losing all of their health/health was spilling out.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Created by: Erin Sawyer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:41:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef5/ef58230879adc21068c6e868b1f7ee4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Erinsa"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
