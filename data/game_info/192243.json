{"id": 192243, "slug": "meeting-pigman", "name": "Meeting Pigman", "name_original": "Meeting Pigman", "description": "<p><strong>The Origin</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The whole concept of\u00a0Meeting Pigman was based on a \u00a0dream of mine about a year ago. It was\u00a0definitely\u00a0impressive to me that I could still\u00a0recall\u00a0the\u00a0dread,\u00a0nervousness and the sense of helplessness while in the dream. These \u00a0emotions are what I aim to represent\u00a0throughout this environmental experience game.</p>\n<p><strong>The Experience</strong></p>\n<p>This\u00a0game will bring you to\u00a0an isolated and creepy house\u00a0with\u00a0the first person\u00a0perspective \u00a0of a\u00a0little girl who wanders and\u00a0feels confused by\u00a0all fugitive phenomena and arrangements all around just like you do. But when you found the note that seems written from someone hiding in this house, this place would be ready\u00a0to take you to the mystery that might\u00a0require a lot of searching. Of course, according to the title, you know who you are going to look for - the Pigman.</p>\n<p><strong>The Connotation</strong></p>\n<p>With the dark red\u00a0flood, blood-like waterfalls, stains everywhere, it can be interpreted that this place represents the little girl's\u00a0chaotic and unstable state of mind. All these clips, belongings and weird incidents are the flashbacks or memories of her past. The experience of find Pigman would also be the process of gaining self-discovery and self-acceptance.\u00a0More than that, I want to further inspect the topic of mental illness, which often relates to the influences from childhood, family and self-cognition. In this game, I didn't attach a fixed definition to the distressing experience of the little girl because I prefer to let these ambiguous occasions to invoke players' own understanding and connection by the household scenes in game\u00a0compared to their own emotional moments.</p>\n<p><strong>The Self-Reflection</strong></p>\n<p>While I was producing the game, I soon realised why I would be so impressed by this game. My explanation to my self was that I have been living with the anxiety of studying and living aboard for a long time. When I was homesick or depressive while recalling my memories back home, they always seem obscure and unfamiliar, which caused another sense of disacquaintance to myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p>\n<p>On the\u00a0aesthetic \u00a0standard, a part of my design choices\u00a0and inspirational ideas were impacted by the game Postal 2. I love its colour scheme but to fit my own vibe, I chose more colour contrasts to bring out the intense and chaotic atmosphere.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dd4a7d0e4a86efc27fe41994bf481bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["KinoZhang"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
