{"id": 160840, "slug": "true-dungeon", "name": "True Dungeon", "name_original": "True Dungeon", "description": "<p>(Still in very early stages of development,\u00a0so there is very little gameplay and assets are basic. This will be resolved as the game is updated, and I aim to do this frequently.\u00a0 As for now this is a small demo to test the movement variables and camera settings.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>True Dungeon is aiming to be a 2D platformer dungeon crawler, with a permadeath system in place.\u00a0 When released there will be 6 playable characters, each with their own unique playstyles which drastically change the way you'll approach the game.</p>\n<p>Each character will have a backstory of how they wound up at the dungeon, which will serve as their tutorial on how to play them to make it both a fun tutorial and an interactive lore experience. This will tie into the bosses they fight at the main dungeon, as well as who their \"nemesis\" will be once they've conquered the True Dungeon, who will serve as a super boss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dungeon layouts will be hand made for each character to accomadate their abilities, but the rooms will be randomly selected from a handful of those crafted templates. This will give each run a new way to traverse the levels,\u00a0 along with different loot and equipment for different runs as well. This is to ensure replayability and to give the player something to do after completing the game. To add to this I'm going to aim to add difficulty settings into the game if possible which will be unlocked upon completed playthroughs.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated, and any suggestions on adding/changing/removing content\u00a0will be taken into consideration and you'll be updated on the outcome! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ec/8ece78e5b7f9d6ecba3638510f0264c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wispyr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
