Changing the template, shape, fin assignment and graphics will radically alter the dynamic of the board in the water, allowing you to get just the right combination of speed, carving and stability you will need to progress.<br/><br/>The game is set within a full 3D environment and employs slow-motion and action cameras to give a cinematic experience.  Both Male and Female characters are included.  The game is also loaded with information on the top surf spots from around the world (courtesy of SurfingAtlas.com) and on the evolution of the Surfboard.<br/><br/>This is not a surfing simulation as such, the emphasis here is on fun, so expect devastating &amp;#39;over-the-falls&amp;#39; wipe-outs, expect to pull loads of hyper-real board tricks, (grabs, flips, handstands,  headspins, hang10\u2019s, etc.), expect scene setting 60\u2019s style Surf Music... Oh, yes, and expect shark infested water too!<br/><br/>To ease you in, this game starts slow, but gets really fast.  As such it uses the touch-screen (rather than the accelerometer) as a control system - this puts the action at your fingertips and you in direct control of the board with the fastest response time - you will need it.<br/><br/>\u2022 Anyone will enjoy this game, but it was made by people who care about Surfing, for Surfers - something to do on the flat days?  <br/><br/>Thanks for playing.<br/><br/>Independent Reviews:<br/><br/>\u201cThe surfing video game is fun again... ...While other surfing games have tried emphasizing an overly realistic surfing experience, or a childishly simplistic approach, OTF Surfing managed to take an arcade game approach and apply it to a realistic surfing experience...\u201d <br/>[dailystoke.com (ASP Addict)]<br/><br/>\u201cThere have been many attempts at making a surfing game and each one seems to top the previous title, OTF Surfing is no exception.  This is a great arcade surfing game that I thoroughly enjoyed, definitely worth a pick up in my opinion\u201d<br/>[razorianfly.com (Damon)]<br/><br/>\u201cWithout doubt OTF is the best [surfing game] of the bunch, polished, engaging and above all LOTS OF FUN\u201d <br/>[slidetoplay.com (user review)]", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a9/8a9bca5f4aa60c34294e27a83256d8b4_MZSA7J2.jpeg", "website": "http://web.me.com/digitaldouble/digital_double/OTF_Surfing.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["DigitalDouble"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Rob Wright"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
