Hide under furniture, set your trajectory and plow into your enemies, knocking them over with such force that they go flying, then munch them up when they\u2019re down.<br />\nBut make sure you don\u2019t leave too much blood on the carpet, because you\u2019ll need to make sure the house is clean before the family gets home.
