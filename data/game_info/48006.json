I'm finally fine after the car accident. But now I am paying the bills. Uff. Life is taking a lot of time from me. I am not replying so many reviews as before... because it make me really anxious. Really. I read your awesome words, and that burns my DNA to come back and develop more games. Right now I have to focus on this crazy life routine. The iOS version of the game is off because I can't pay Apple Dev program anymore. The android version will stay here, but with no further updates. I beg your pardon. Thanks for the comprehension. <br/><br/>Thanks for playing. Try my other game: Space Spacy. :)", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T14:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/275e31bd25b0fc19ce4569dac9bc8b35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Henry Gosuen"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
