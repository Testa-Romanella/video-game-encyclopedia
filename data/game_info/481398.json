It includes a number of\u00a0different levels, one level is\u00a0free roam - the player\u00a0drives around with no limits (timing limits).\u00a0There are three other levels that are\u00a0goal focused, to get somewhere or to destroy something with a time restraint.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the main menu, the player can load levels or view information from here.</p>\n\n<p>This is what is seen when the free roam level is launched. In this level the player can explore the entire city.</p>\n\n<p>Here the player can select which level to play.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to Project:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was a solo learning project, I did the level design and the majority of the programming. The programming that I didn't do was the car and camera movement, I simply made\u00a0changes to some statistics in the inspector tab. The level was built using a couple of\u00a0free asset packs from the unity asset store.</p>\n<p>For the programming that I did do I learnt many things. I learnt how to create a checkpoint system for the\u00a0player,\u00a0the goal can only be reached/hit if all checkpoints have been hit. I also created, using code, a fuel system for the car, that when depleted sends the player into a fuel empty scene.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:49:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/288/28820d49dde226ac53ac676242bea97a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucas Fernandes Marcos"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
