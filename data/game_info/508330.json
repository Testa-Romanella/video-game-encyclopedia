A lot of the game systems were unable to be implemented within the time due to university courses clashing with the time scale.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The idea of Platforms was to create a game that would serve as a backdrop (or a <em>platform</em>) for the various different types of mentoring YMCA Scotland offer for young people, as the brief suggested this would be something used between a mentor and mentee across a wide range of mentoring focuses, so we didn\u2019t want to directly focus on specific types of mentoring as that would alienate the experience for other types.\r\n  </p>\n<p>2 players, a mentor and mentee, would move around on a 2d train doing tasks to make a train in the 3D world progress faster along the track. At points in the track players would be transported to different small tableus of a forest, meadow and seaside where they could take in the atmosphere and have more of a break and admire and talk about the scenery with your mentor.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we could not implement any networking in the game so most of the game is unfinished. Thank you for the opportunity to experiment around in Unity with cameras!</p>\n<p>Also, a bug I couldn't fix was getting the orthographic 2D camera to clear camera correctly so the 2D view would look seamless in the 3D view. The screenshots show how they should work as they do in the editor...<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d055f8d4a55a334e0cc5b445088e81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
