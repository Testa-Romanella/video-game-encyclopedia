The more birds you   scare away, the more will come. Some birds take a few times to scare   away, so keep scaring away. How long will you last? Only time will tell.   Good Luck!       </p>\n<p>Tap away at birds as they fly towards the power line. Larger birds require more taps to get rid of.  \r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Play in fullscreen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T09:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf7/cf7ff737ed6d925943a9f01c09e1fa4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stalfo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
