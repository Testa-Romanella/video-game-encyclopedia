Each route can also yield different affects, such as healing you, granting you potions, or upgrading your equipment. Be careful which routes you pick, as some of these \"rewards\" can make combat shorter, which is the opposite of what you want!\r\n</p>\r\nCombat -\u00a0\r\n<p>Take turns with your enemies in combat by selecting combat actions. Each action you and your opponents make will take time. Plan carefully! Status effects are healed when combat ends.\r\n</p>\r\nDeath\u00a0 -\u00a0\r\n<p>Should you die,\u00a0 you will be revived with half HP and MP and poison will be cured. If you are in combat,\u00a0all of your enemies will be defeated and combat will end.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Dungeon Crawl is my submission for Ludem\u00a0Dare 50, where the theme is \"Delay the Inevitable\". It is a point and click dungeon crawler where you want to take as long as possible to escape.<br/></p>\n<p>While adventuring in a dungeon lost to time, you were possessed by the Demon Lord Imp'a-Tient! He now is forcing you out of the dungeon so that he make wreak havoc upon the world. Thankfully you have just enough control over your body to hinder his progress. Try to keep yourself in the dungeon long enough so that Imp'a-Tient gets bored and decides to leave you alone.</p>\n\n<p>Ludum Dare link (please vote!):</p>\n<p>\u00a0https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/dungeon-crawl</p>\n\n<p>The programming and design was done by myself with help from some testers.
