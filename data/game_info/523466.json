I wanted to do something pretty with lights and create a mysterious atmosphere with music but turned out that i'm not a great artist and a complete beginner in music and sound design. Sooo the result is not what i had in mind but i learned many things so its cool. I will try to update it, add more levels and mechanics.</p>\n<p>Have fun !</p>\n<p>PS : There is still some minor issues on the coloration of a block, and other things. For now, you have to play the game with a controller. Might add keyboard support in futur update.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T05:30:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97aa1f8309a618fc1662f3401c7b4a33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aerkaos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
