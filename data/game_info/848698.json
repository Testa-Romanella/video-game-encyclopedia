A very difficult tower defense shooter. There are three different modes to unlock, three different weapons to unlock, and four different endings depending on how well you do and what mode you are able to beat.\u00a0Everything was made by me, Mark Edwards, including the music and graphics. The graphics and music are not the best. I hope they can be excused. The gameplay did become very difficult and exciting enough to have me jumping on the edge of my seat while trying to beat some levels. I hope you will enjoy it! Good luck in beating it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T23:43:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af5/af5c3243308d817c305630ae310e37a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["markedwards"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
