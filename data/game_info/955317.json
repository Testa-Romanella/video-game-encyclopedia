Created with GB-Studio 2.0.0 beta5!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The player takes the role of a yellow Volkswagen Beetle (Type 1) Choro-Q, with a surfboard carrier on its roof. The objective of the game is to assemble two more VW Beetles while contending with hostile Choro-Q cars that intend to impede the player's progress. The enemies can be eliminated by jumping on them.</p>\n<p>However, the player has a limited amount of life to complete the VW Beetles, which must be assembled in the right order; First, the chassis, then the motor, and lastly the body. When one VW Beetle is completed, it leaves behind a power-up (indicated by a coin-like icon with a dollar sign ($) on it) that grants temporary invincibility, allowing the player to plow through enemy cars.</p>\n<p>The level is completed by assembling both VW Beetles. The parts of the Beetles are on the edges of a three-level suspended platform system, and must be pushed off for assembly. The player can jump on the platforms to reach the parts.</p>\n<p>The player can lose lives by starting or performing an assembly out of order, crashing into a wall at high speed, falling from too great a height, colliding with an enemy Choro-Q. If the player loses all lives, it results in a game over.
