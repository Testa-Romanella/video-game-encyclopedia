In this game, you are a black ball with wings, jumping around trying to avoid the red enemies. Collect the arrows to earn a jump, if you run out of jumps, you will not be able to jump, the amount of jumps that you have accumulated is displayed in the top right corner of the page, and your current score is displayed in the top left corner of the page. Controls:\u00a0Arrows/WASD to move, and space bar to jump.
