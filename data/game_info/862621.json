Fighting his journey through an abandoned city looking for the infinite power source.</strong></p><p><em>This is a jam game submitted to Ludum Dare 51.\r\n</em><br/></p>How the batteries work\r\n<p>Your  energy is slowly running out, and you can only hold 3 batteries, each  holding power to keep you alive for 10 seconds. The currently used one  is displayed with 10 parts, while enemies attacking you can damage some  parts of it, reducing the remaining energy faster. Once the current  battery is empty, it will be replaced with another full battery if you  have one (or you die). Killing enemy grants you full batteries, but if  you don\u2019t have space for another battery, the overflowing power will  grant you greater strength for a limited amount of time (right upper  bar). <br/></p>Movement\r\n<ul><li>Move:\u00a0<em>WASD<br/></em></li><li>Jump:\u00a0<em><strong>Space <br/></strong></em></li><li>Attack: <em><strong>E<br/></strong></em></li><li>Dash: <em><strong>Shift<br/></strong></em></li></ul>\n<p>supports Controller input</p>Credits\r\n<ul><li>Adrian Kunz - Composition\r\n</li><li>AzureBlue - Game Logic\r\n</li><li>Sam Wain (Tatha) -  SFX, Audio Implementation\r\n</li><li>Substain - Game Logic, UI\r\n</li><li>Sun Kejian - Art \r\n</li></ul><p>Made with Godot.<br/></p>\r\nBugfixes (v1.2 Post Jam Version):\r\n<ul><li>fixed certain audio not being played</li><li>game won screen brings you back to menu</li><li>credit overlap fixed</li><li>fixed colliders</li><li>fixed resizing</li><li>resolved pit problem </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T15:29:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd0d3d411fe11e0d5dac7fcf5c5e743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Wain - Sound Designer & Composer"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
