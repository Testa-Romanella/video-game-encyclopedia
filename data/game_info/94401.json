We've drawn\r\ninspiration from early Disney cartoons, Aztec and Mayan culture and\r\nthe Cthulu Mythos to create a world that has a colourful and bright\r\nsurface, with dark and twisted roots.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Synopsis</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Centuries\r\nago, five beings rose up to overthrow a tyrannical Elder Being and\r\nseal its evil away where it could no longer influence the world\r\naround it.</em></p>\n<p><em>As\r\ncivilisation developed under the Fives rule, the world slowly forgot\r\nabout the threat of the entity, and the last remnants of its empire\r\nhave turned to dust.</em></p>\n<p><em>Now,\r\na group of cultists succeed in awakening this darkness from its\r\nslumber, drawing it back into the world in a new form. \r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>\r\nIt's\r\ngleaming smile belies its dark intentions, and the entity sets out\r\ntowards the Fives stronghold, determined to reclaim its empire, and\r\nmake the world that forgot its rule tremble.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Dynamic Music System</em></strong></p>\n<p>Choreo incorporates a dynamic music system that develops the main score as you attract more followers. </p>\n<p>\r\n At\r\nthe start of each level you will only have access to a simple guitar track, giving you a basic ambient score.\u00a0Each Follower you collect brings more instruments to the track, eventually giving you access to the full Theme at around\r\nthe mid point of the level. The idea is that as the intensity of the\r\nlevel increases, so too will the music, and finding those additional\r\ninstruments provides extra incentive to explore.</p>\n<p><em>Composed By Richard Evans - www.rb-evans.com</em></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Engaging 2D Platforming</em></strong></p>\n<p>Whilst our tutorial level is designed to introduce the basic flow of 2D platforming, the main level should provide a challenge to even seasoned 2D Platformers. Combining our own experiences as players with engaging genre tropes, we've aimed to create a visually impressive, enjoyable experience that will introduce you to our world, and some of the characters that inhabit it.</p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Multiple Paths</strong></em></p>\n<p>There are several different routes that interlink through the main level, you'll have to explore them all to collect everything and complete your band!</p>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Our first project</strong></em></p>\n<p>Starting as a learning environment for two friends 5 months ago, Choreo began development as a way to learn how to create games and implement assets. As development progressed, we began to see more merit in the concept, which led us to develop the playable first level and tutorial that is now available.</p>\n<p>We're still new to the whole development process, and are aware that Choreo is far from perfect, so any feedback you can give us to help make the game better would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If there's enough interest following our demo, we would love to move into full development and continue to expand the Choreo Universe, so let us know if this is something you would like to see.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>W/A/D or Left/Right/Up Arrow with Space as a third jump option.</p>\n<p>Fire:</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Click</p>\n\n<p>Currently only a PC build is available, we hope you enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p>Social\u00a0Media Links:</p>\n<p>Our Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/HeraldofLoco</p>\n<p>Our\u00a0Facebook Page:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/HeraldOfLoco/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/176/17675cc099a079cede28747195a23bef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MegaSloth"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
