Taking the raycast from my team game EverCore I applied the same technique to the ground and the clouds to detect the jumping. Specifically in this project I learned how to use and implement a type of design pattern called a singleton from my time working with MassDigi on Bewitching Boba. Since a singleton is allowed only one instance of itself to be present at a time its great for things like save data or access data stored across functions or objects.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T06:06:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a4/7a439b3b11ff954274707193774281c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoKell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
