Pandemic is a sequel to Virus, but with unlimited ammunition you can now go in with all guns blazing without fear of running out of ammo at that pivotal moment (just the fear of being suffocated by the virus)<br/> <br/> The game isn't just Virus with some tweaks and new levels though, the engine has been redeveloped to cater for more enemies, diagonal movement and firing, virus generators, and key walls to name but a few improvements. The game is also three times larger than its predecessor, boasting 24 levels of biological warfare.<br/> <br/> Just don't shoot the food!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/419edf9b056eeb72bfac6f50f5bda63f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bob's Stuff"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
