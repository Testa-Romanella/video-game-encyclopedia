Instead of uselessly trying harder on my grades, I  started making my ideal flying game. I would work non-stop until I fell asleep at 4AM in front of my computer and as soon as I woke up I would keep working on it. I didn't make anything great but I did learn quite a lot. I recently found some of the oldest builds of this game project and I'm archiving them all here so I don't lose them in the freak accident that's bound to happen to me at any time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53be0438c3e3631b90b04fd01b1df7c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngelOnIt"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
