Dots can leave their orbital course around the gravity zones in a tangent line. Just tap or drag the\u00a0gravity zone.\u00a0Dragging slows down time. You can control more dots simultaneously,\u00a0bounce from\u00a0obstacles, hit shrinking boxes and switches. To achieve higher scores you should avoid loosing your \"herd of white dots\", not hitting the sidewalls or the spiky obstacles, and not leaving them behind!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/055/055e06b8845cc4a5817eb3aa9cb174ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroCow"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
