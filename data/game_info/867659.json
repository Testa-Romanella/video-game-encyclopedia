All of his friends would rather enjoy their devices than talk to each other. The frog would love to be like a ninjaturtle, from which he gets the idea to go on a vengeance against modern technology. The only problem is that the frog doesn\u2019t know how to fight but rather he eats the pizza he loves. He turns his weakness into a strength and eats a piece of moldy pizza that gives him the ability to shoot vomit. A\u00a0vengeance against the machines can begin!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T16:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7ca9a195828103bf3eb3a9f9d34d2bea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Markus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
