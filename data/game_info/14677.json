He has all the eggs a digital water fowl could ever want. He ROLLS in eggs. He might have \"A DEPENDENCY ISSUE\" with eggs.<br/><br/>What sucks about this is that the dreaded GEESE GANG is totally hating on him because they are garbage - and I mean, if you really think about it, no one ever goes \"aw, look at that cute goose over there\". The Geese are aware of that: it makes them unstable.<br/><br/>Long story short, they want DUCKSTER'S eggs but he's not going to let it happen, because like I said earlier he might have a dependency issue with the eggs.<br/><br/><strong>Collect eggs in a variety of extreme and overwhelming game modes, cool?</strong><br/>This game is <strong>hard</strong> so get used to it you puppies<br/><br/>This game is hard, just like DUCKSTER's life.<br/>______________________________________________________________<br/><br/>QUACK ATTACK 1985: TURBO DX EDITION is part of the ATTACK PACK, which also includes SOS and THE GREY MAN!
