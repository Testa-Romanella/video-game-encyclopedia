This is the first alpha prototype game from Cicada Studios, called BrawlWay. It's not very long and more of a proof of concept than anything else. </p><p>With that said, we'd love feedback and thoughts. The gameplay is pretty simple:</p><p>Space = Punch<br/>Lctrl = Block (This fills up your punch meter when you block fireballs)<br/>Lalt = Special Punch (This is the only way to damage the final boss)<br/><br/>The game is hard, so give it a few tries before you dismiss it. Thanks and enjoy.</p><p>-matthew &amp; ian</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9eea105510fdb7bfd01fd6d6fb44e4a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CicadaStudio"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
