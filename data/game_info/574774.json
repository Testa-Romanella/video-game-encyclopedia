Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional game controllers may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Playing the game is divided between finding a room to play in, selecting a song, and playing a song. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Playing a song<br/><br/>Horizontal bars slide down a series of six columns, each corresponding to a key S, D, F, J, K, L on the keyboard. Just before the notes hit the bottom of the column, the player has to hit the key corresponding to that column. Each keypress emits a note, vocal, or other instrument that creates a full-sounding song. A correct hit is also rewarded with a small 3D visual effect that is determined by the background on which the players are playing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The grading scale used by the game is, from most accurate press to least, OK, Perfect and Miss. Consecutive OK and Perfect notes add both to the player's combo meter. <br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-22T02:16:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02d/02dc6f2707b744fe71aa7ef9d6cae132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yugamesplay"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["yugamesplay"], "esrb_rating": null}
