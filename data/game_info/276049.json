Use Q and E to rotate the camera around the ball and use the SPACE bar to speed up (every 15 seconds a player can speed up). The goal of this game is to pick up objects as a Katamari ball and get the diameter of the ball to 16cm before the timer runs out. Some objects may not be picked up right away, but the bigger the ball is, the more you can pick up!</p>\n<p>The audio in itch.io is not working but see our YouTube video for full sound and play through</p>\n<p>Youtube Link:\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6ccaa6423fd29fb4a99ac4c3c5dc4a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["msutton22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
