We don\u2019t really find out too much about his story until later but he\u2019s similar to Link from Zelda however he is the demigod son of Quetzalcoatl - and he only gets awoken every few thousand years when the earth is in a lot of danger.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play (at the moment)!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Movement:<br/></p>\n<p>W, S, A, D (keyboard keys for Up, Down, Left, Right)\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.5D Puzzle - Space To Jump (additional controls for attack and melee attack coming soon!)</p>\n<p>Pickup and carry the\u00a0<strong>Glowing Yellow Paper</strong>\u00a0over to the\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Yellow Trash Can\u00a0</strong>(Recycle bins)\r\n*\u00a0<em><strong>Shoot</strong>\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<strong><em>kill\u00a0</em></strong>the enemy creatures throwing garbage at you!\r\n*\u00a0<strong><em>Avoid the BLACK obstacles and the\u00a0</em>DEMON</strong>\u00a0approaching from the left side of the screen!
