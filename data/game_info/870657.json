It is actually our first game ever made\u00a0with very little experience with 3D modelling\u00a0and Godot,\u00a0but\u00a0we are happy with how it turned out! We planned a bigger game, but time was not on our side, so we had to cut a lot of ideas and we just did the bare bone that we planned from the start.\u00a0</p>\r\nStory\r\nYou are Nozomi. A stray kitten taken in by a university student named\u00a0Hayami. One night you wake up to the sound of a picture frame falling over and a big hunger in your stomach. With your owner nowhere to be found you decide to go on an adventure for food\u00a0through moonlight\u00a0filled streets of Fukuoka, Japan.\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Short story featuring cutscenes</li><li>2D pixel art in a 3D World</li><li>Controller support</li><li>Original Soundtrack</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong><em>\u2b05\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f</em></strong>\u00a0- Move Left/Right\ud83d\udc08 (Can also use A/D)\r\n</li><li><em><strong>E\u00a0</strong></em>- Interact/Meow\ud83d\udc31 (Can also use X on Keyboard and X/\u25fe\u00a0on controller)\r\n</li><li><strong><em>SHIFT\u00a0</em></strong>- Run\ud83d\udc3e (Can also use Y on Keyboard and A/\u2716\u00a0on controller)</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>totsu - Game Director, Development, Some Visuals, Story, Music</li><li>Samix. -\u00a0 Music, Visuals, 3D Models, Story\r\n</li><li>Orsino - testing, moral support, feedback</li></ul>\n<p>made for the\u00a0\ud83d\udcb5 $100 Game Jam\u00a0with the limitation of\u00a0only\u00a0having 2 buttons outside of movement and the theme being \"Moon Light\"</p>\n<p><em>if there are issues with the HTML5 build, try downloading the game instead.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>The game is meant to be played in one sitting so it does not feature any saving.
