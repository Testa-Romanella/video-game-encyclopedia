You are presented two images almost identical but at most 4 different spots. If you find all the differences in each stage before the countdown timer runs out, the remained time will be added to your score. Be careful! Wrong spot means time penalty! But you will be relieved to know that\u00a0some unused\u00a0item is left!<br/><br/>It's not an irritating vision test like other games. Just concentrate on it and believe your intuition, you can't miss it.<br/><br/>People who already bought JustFindit says ...<br/>\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335 I like the interface and style a lot, it looks like one is showing the differences by drawing with a grease pencil. - lv*******<br/>\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335 I've played a number of games similar to this one, and this is one of the better in the lot - Dr*****<br/>\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335 Difficutly settings are a welcome diversion from the norm in where you can choose from how many differences there will be in picture - Ma****<br/>\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335 My whole family likes this game - ap*****<br/>\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335\ue335 Has great depth and good controls!! - Ni*******<br/> <br/>Features<br/> \ue42b 90 magnificent\u00a0photos (Full version : 300 photos) from all around the world.
