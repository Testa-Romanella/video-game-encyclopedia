The main character\u00a0Nenji (I know it's a very creative name if i say so myself XD) is a young ninja-wannabe\u00a0 who is training to be a full-fledged ninja in various simulations designed to teach him skill for being an actual ninja. While training he is often interrupted by his neighbor's daughter Jiji, who unlike Nenji, is already a full-fledged ninja. She's had a crush on him for as long as she can remember, so she always keeps secretly following\u00a0 him while he's training and when she gets a chance she attacks him, in order to kiss him uwu. On the other hand Nenji only cares about becoming a ninja and he's finds Jiji very annoying due her constant interruptions during his training and her persistant demands  for kisses.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T05:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b82b374d91526c3cc76e966047626027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Morphy ( O u O )/"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
