The goal of the game isn't to avoid dying, because the game <em>always</em> ends in death. The goal of the game is to live a fulfilling life, and to  die a <em>good</em> death. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T11:11:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8aa/8aa9b9eeec856785ce6aecd20841d085.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Deadnettle Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
