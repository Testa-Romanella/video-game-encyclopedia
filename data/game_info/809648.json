You can go from one to the other by walking through a mirror/portal. Each area has a door that leads to a different level ( but you don't know which one so one could lead you back to the previous level and you don't know hehe ). Puzzles range from pushing objects into zones, shooting targets to growing a sphere to be big enough to use it as a bridge.</p>\n<p>Btw, the last level has no puzzle, it's just filled with physics simulated shapes for you to have fun !</p>\n<p>How this fits the GeoJam themes:</p>\n<p>Geometry: The levels are made almost only from basic shapes. The mirrors/portals use angles. Some shapes in the levels have a texture that uses world projection to give a cool effect ( projection is geometry ). A puzzle also includes spheres that grow in volume.</p>\n<p>Pick a Side: Each level has 2 areas ( sides ) with each 1 puzzle and door that leads to an other level. You pick a side you want to complete the puzzle on and use the door and hope that was the one that moved you towards the last level the most !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-27T10:09:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d09/d09b5a2ddb4c1c02bdf5e185cb6a952f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxMakesGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
