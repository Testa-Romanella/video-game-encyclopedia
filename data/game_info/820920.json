And with no backup and time left, some capital buttons are not appearing and so the game is not playable. We are deeply sorry :(</strong><br/></em></p><p><em>Welcome to the city, where neons burn bright and crime never sleeps.</em></p>\n<p><em>As the owner of an underground gambling parlour, your goal is to get as much money as you can from the passerby.</em></p>\n<p><em>At the beginning of each turn, clients will roll one numeric dice and one relational dice.</em></p>\n<p><em>When every client has played, it'll be your turn, as a the bank, to roll. You will then have to assign every dice to a client to beat their numeric / relational result.</em></p>\n<p><em>But this a scam join right\u00a0? Before rolling your dice, you'll have to chose between several crooked dice. Choose well !\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>But beware... some clients have good eyes and your trickeries might raise suspicion.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play :</strong></p>\n<ul><li>SPACE to start the round and roll your dice.</li><li>A/Q : to assign a dice to the first client</li><li>Z/W : to assign a dice to the second client</li><li>E : to assign a dice to the third client.</li></ul>\n<p><em>(Partially works with a controller. A to start and roll and X, Y, B to assign dice to clients).</em></p>\n\n<p>There are 4 different faces on relational dice. Lower than, Greater Than, Equal and Different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If a client rolls 1 and Different (symbolized by &lt;&gt;) it means you need to roll some different than a 1. If you want to win against this hand, it would be a good idea to pick a crooked dice that only lands on even numbers !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T04:43:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b72/b72df9b7787704e423db062d2a0f446f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LaFrite"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
