To activate a battery, the player simply has to touch it on one of the four sides.<br/>The player has the option of moving around the rooms by jumping from battery to battery or by using elevators\u00a0that move vertically or horizontally. Sometimes there are portals through which the player\u00a0can teleport to another point in the room.<br/>Mike has no defense against aliens. The only way to complete a level is therefore to avoid them\u00a0not to lose a life. Even the contact with the cooling fans, present in some rooms, is fatal.<br/>To complicate matters, there is a time limit, after which the player will lose a life.<br/>After activating a certain number of batteries, a crystal will appear for approximately 10 seconds. The player\u00a0can try to pick it up to increase the score.<br/>Once all the batteries in a room have been activated, the player will earn an extra score based on the amount of time left\u00a0and will go to the next level.</p>\n<p>Every 10000 points the player earns an extra life,\u00a0for a maximum of 8 lives.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Options<br/></strong>The game includes 70 levels in total. By choosing Ship Layout A, you will play the easiest 35 levels. By choosing Layout B, you will play the 35 most difficult levels.
