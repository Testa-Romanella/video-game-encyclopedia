You shall make this journey alone by yourself. Who you will meet, even I do not know. Make your way towards what your intuition guides. The fate you yearn for shall lead your way.\"</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Place cards in between you and your opponent. When a card is on the board, it will automatically attack the minion across from it at the end of the turn.\u00a0<strong>(A minion's attack is on\u00a0the bottom left of the card</strong><strong>)</strong>. If there is no minion, then the enemy hero will take damage. \u00a0If a minion reaches zero health <strong>(Health is on the bottom right)</strong>, it will be sent to the graveyard. If a player tries\u00a0 to draw a card with no cards in their deck, the graveyard will be shuffled back into their deck. A minion will not attack the first turn it is played.</p>\n<p><strong>Each card has a cost (top right).\u00a0</strong>A player has 8 willpower to spend each turn. At the start of your turn, your willpower returns to 8 and you draw a card.\u00a0</p>\r\nCertain cards have special effects. These can be seen by clicking on the card.\r\n<p>Once an enemy is defeated, you can let them go<strong> (green button)</strong> or kill them\u00a0<strong>(red button</strong>). Killing them will give you a stronger card, but you will be judged for your actions.\u00a0</p>\r\nYou can click on the cards in the decision panel to examine them too.\r\n\n<p>Made by Jonas Traweek, NvN, Tartles, Sincey, and RacingAndy.
