Their abilities are used upon clicking on them.</p>\n\n<p>Other missing\u00a0cards become available when using them, and while the player progresses through different levels, new cards will become available as well. Some cards can affect the status of the player seen on the left. When using a strength card for example, a strength attribute will show next to the player and will impact the damage done to the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>Above the slime enemy's head\u00a0is a blocking move, indicating that the enemy will block your attack and heal on the next turn rather than attack. As you progress through the game, your attributes are kept.
