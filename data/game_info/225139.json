Puzzles", "description": "Puzzles are games for children that are used as fun and as an instrument to improve memory and concentration. Edujoy's educational puzzles contain fun images of our main character, the raccoon, and his animal friends, so that children improve their visual perception and memory skills through colorful drawings and pieces of different sizes and shapes.<br/><br/>4 TYPES OF PUZZLES<br/><br/>Classic Puzzles: In this game mode, children will be able to play easy, medium and more complex puzzles using the classic pieces of the common puzzles.<br/><br/>-Square puzzles: Children have to slide the pieces, this time with square shape, until putting all in the correct place.<br/><br/>-Circular Puzzle: This type of puzzle is very original. Children should rotate each of the concentric circles clockwise or counterclockwise to complete it.<br/><br/>-Incomplete Puzzles: This is the most difficult game mode, since movements are more limited, pieces only can be moved from left to right and from top to bottom.<br/><br/>PUZZLES WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PIECES<br/><br/>Educational puzzles for Kids are created so that they can be completed by children of different ages and at different stages of their intellectual development.<br/>For this reason, children will be able to play with puzzles of 6, 9, 12, 24, 35 or 48 pieces.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT : CONCENTRATION AND MEMORY<br/><br/>Puzzle games provide many benefits for developing children's abilities. Among others we can highlight:<br/>-Improve their capacity for observation, analysis, concentration and attention. Exercise their visual memory: Kids must remember the initial image of the puzzle to know where to place the pieces later.<br/>-Help to identify and establish relationships between shapes and silhouettes, improving spatial and visual perception.<br/><br/>-Exercise fine motor skills to move the pieces with their fingers.<br/>In addition, Edujoy's educational puzzles offer positive reinforcement with cheerful animations when the child completes the puzzle correctly, to help them increase their self-esteem.<br/><br/>Our recommendation is to start with puzzles with fewer pieces and gradually increase the number so that the child is motivated and facing new challenges with greater security and confidence.<br/><br/>EDUJOY EDUCATIONAL GAMES <br/><br/>This app is part of an educational games collection created by Edujoy in order to help kids to develop new intellectual and motor skills from elements of their environment.<br/><br/>All our games are created by professional educators and psychologists in order to provide pedagogical content, necessary for the intellectual development of babies and children.<br/><br/>We love creating educational and fun games for you.
