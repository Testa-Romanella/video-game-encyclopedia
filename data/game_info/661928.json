You're in an infinity loop and you need to find the invisible portal during your journey. Are you strong enough for do that, or not?<br/></p>\n<p>This is the first prototype of my game. You can download the gb version for free but you need to pay for the 3ds version. \u00a0For the 3ds version, you need to jailbreak it, so view different tutorials on youtube if you can't do it. No panic for GBC or GBA gamers, because it is in colour.</p>\n<p>Follow my instagram account: hetkapitein or De Kapitein.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T01:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/27f/27faa3e367017acb86debf0296b8d4bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kapitein"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
