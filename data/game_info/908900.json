The twist is that you are restricted on what actions you can  perform at certain times.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game includes a description in the beginning, so you will be introduced in all important aspects.\r\n</p>\n<p>P.S.  I had a crazy weekend, I actually don\u2019t know how I finished this game.  Since I only spent 20 hours on the development at max, I would expect  that the game has some bugs, or unintended behaviour at times.\r\n</p>\n<p>All art (sorry in advance, my artistic skills are basically zero), sound effects and gameplay was made by me and me only.</p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:54:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d85/d85a63cf83060414dd116dd023a05bd4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Szivacs"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
