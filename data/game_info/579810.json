I\u00a0bit off a bit more that I\u00a0can chew, and so it had some negative results on the game. I am proud of levels 1, 2 and 3. I\u00a0spent the time I\u00a0wanted to on them. However, level 4 suffered from cramming content, as the project required certain things (elements of greek culture, the whole story, etc). So, when it came down to the wire, I just crammed a bunch of story stuff into that level, making very tedious. Level 5 is actually fun, but it was made on the last night the project was due, and so it is incredibly buggy, and can be frustrating to play. I just wanted to be honest about this. Still do try the game though. It is free, and it won't cost you anything. I am proud of this game overall though, and it took a lot of time and effort to get done. I\u00a0will try and fix these issues in v0.2, if I decide to do that.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:34:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d4cbd0f5c2857eb8c1bd94da965262f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alpha King"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
