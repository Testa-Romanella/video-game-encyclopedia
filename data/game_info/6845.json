Each section has a certain number of ping pong balls. We try to throw these balls into buckets. It is not as easy as it seems. It has more than 30 levels in total. Each successful shot gives you points.<br/><br/>Each bucket of a different color gives different points. Game content includes extra restart points. You can start the section again with these points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>However, if your restart points run out, all your points will be deleted and you will start the game from scratch :) You can see how many times you have started the game from scratch in the main menu. We wish you success in this difficult journey.<br/><br/>PLEASE ADD IT TO YOUR WISH LIST.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T05:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70c/70c4e6a80c41850e82f28c4dc61ed8a1.jpg", "website": "http://trickshotgame.io/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Neobite Games", "Jonathan Topf", "PLEXUS GAME"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Neobite Games", "Jonathan Topf", "PLEXUS GAME"], "esrb_rating": null}
