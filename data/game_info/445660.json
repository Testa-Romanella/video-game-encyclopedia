{"id": 445660, "slug": "the-best-days", "name": "The Best Days", "name_original": "The Best Days", "description": "<p><em>The Best Days </em>is a game about student life and mental upkeep. It\u2019s about pushing forward through the days and nights while attempting to stay healthy and sane. It\u2019s a game about the invisible hours spent toiling away in a room without company. These are, in short, the best days of your life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Settings:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1080p or 4K.</li><li>Headphones (volume &gt; 50%).\u00a0</li><li><strong>Recommended for Windows.\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<p>***<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Detailed Overview:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>The Best Days</em> is a game about anxiety, depression, isolation, time pressure, and boredom,\u00a0but also one about perseverance and routine in the face of them. It\u2019s been created in response to: A) the idealisation of student life (particularly by nostalgic adults), and B) the over-reliance of \u2018black dog\u2019 imagery (or other embodiments) in depicting depression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game hopes instead to focus on the mundane experience of depression and anxiety, physiologically, in the context of day-to-day student life.\u00a0\u00a0It makes extensive use of post-processing and sound effects to recreate/visualise some of the sensations and experiences involved.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is drawn entirely from personal experience and is\u00a0not considered more broadly representative of the student population as a whole.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>This game is currently still somewhat of a prototype in places.
