Orisons and Cantrips, straight from the then new Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition rules, have been added. The game features new character classes and races such as Barbarians, Monks, Paladins, and Half-Orcs. Clerics and Sorcerers can cast over 100 spells. The Dungeon Master communicates all important findings and events throughout the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-24T13:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7fc/7fc8b1ea7ada049fe8c39186e82664f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.4, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 10, "beaten": 4, "toplay": 9, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 496, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stormfront Studios"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Ubisoft Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
