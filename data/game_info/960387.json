However, a sly fox began to steal the chickens, one by one, using robotic henchmen to whisk them away to hidden locations. Determined to rescue his chickens, the rooster embarked on a perilous journey to track down the fox and his minions. Along the way, the rooster discovered he had the ability to shoot fire from his beak, which he used to fight off the robotic henchmen and rescue the chickens. Eventually, the rooster reached the fox's stronghold and engaged in a fierce battle. Despite facing many challenges and obstacles, the rooster never lost hope and ultimately emerged victorious, defeating the fox and rescuing the last of his chickens. The rooster returned home a hero, and the chickens lived happily ever after, safe and sound thanks to their brave and valiant protector. The end.<br/><br/><h3>Developer Story</h3><br/>As a solo indie game developer, creating my first game, Rooster Tale, has been a challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. The game follows the adventures of a rooster named Rooster as he navigates through various levels filled with obstacles and enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I wanted the game to have a retro feel, so I chose to use pixel graphics and incorporate elements of adventure and puzzle platforming. Making the game challenging is also important to me, so I have spent a lot of time playtesting and fine-tuning the difficulty to ensure it is just right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The process of developing Rooster Tale has not been without its obstacles. There have been many late nights spent coding and troubleshooting, as well as moments of self-doubt where I have questioned whether I am capable of seeing the project through to the end. However, the sense of accomplishment I will feel when I finally finish and publish the game will be worth all of the hard work.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I am excited to say that Rooster Tale is still in development and I am hard at work on completing it. I hope that those who play the game will enjoy the challenges and adventures that Rooster encounters on his journey.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-05T05:02:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d91/d910a737ece4deb766be5dedd22a0a51.jpg", "website": "http://roostertale.wextap.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nuh Mehmet Demirkol"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Nuh Mehmet Demirkol"], "esrb_rating": null}
