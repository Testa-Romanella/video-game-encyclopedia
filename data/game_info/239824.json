Go to your iPhone / iPod's homescreen.<br/>2. Press the lock button (at the upper right of the device) and keep it pressed - and press the homebutton at the same time<br/>3. Let go of both buttons and you should hear a camera click sound - the screen will go white for a second. If you don't get the sound and white screen, repeat steps 2 and 3 until it works.<br/>4. Now start iDestroy and start a new \"destruction sandbox\" game.<br/>5. Go to the weapons menu (upper right corner, the yellow grenade) and in the following screen,  tap the blue icon \"custom background\".<br/>6. Your photos will be shown - the last of which should be your homescreen, pick that one.<br/>7. Start the destruction :) <br/><br/>We would like to thank all the fans of iDestroy! <br/>Your good iTunes reviews and ratings keep us motivated to keep updating<br/>iDestroy!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34a/34abca3f4d0bdfe251c63be363945909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 220, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Stark Apps"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Stark Apps"], "esrb_rating": null}
