She is tasked with taking care of Harriet's house, who is an old lady. She gave us a list of chores we have to do; however, her handwriting is absolutely terrible, and only certain words and letters can be made out. Using the letters you know and your surroundings, you need to figure out the first letter of each task she must do. Then, you can press that letter on the keyboard, making Liv remember her task.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cdfe56af095e6359af826ead19798ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GeorgePigStan"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
