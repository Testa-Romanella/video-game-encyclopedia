I am a solo developer that has dreamt of creating games since I was 12.  So I wanted to pay tribute to the very first game I owned as a child, but also creating something of my own.  The first game I owned as a child was for the Tandy Color Computer 2 called Dungeons of Daggorath.  It was a very basic dungeon crawler with simple line graphics.  Crusader: Dungeon Series - Dungeon of Dagginor is the first in a series of add-ons.<br/><br/><strong>Game Play:</strong><br/>Movement is done via WSAD (Forward, Backward, Left, Right) with Mouse Button 1 as Primary attack, Mouse Button 2 as Block, and Q, E, R as secondary abilities.
