Deciding that there are too many criminals on the planet, they hit the planet's self destruct switch. It's the final three minutes for the planet but maybe you can get past all of the police robots and escape to a nearby rocket before then with the help of your trusty grappling hook.</p>\n\n<p>Made for: https://itch.io/jam/winter-jam-by-solodevelopment <br/></p>\n\n<p>Did most of my work on this in the first 24 hours of the jam, then burnt myself out. I managed to polish it up a little but it is still really unpolished, there's no sound for example. Still though, I'm still happy with what I managed to do given this was my first game jam and I'm very busy in general at the moment. Next time I'm hopefully going to be able to pace myself better and polish whatever I make a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>Fonts used: https://www.1001fonts.com/digital-7-font.html , https://www.1001fonts.com/neuropol-x-free-font.html<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T17:51:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e8/0e8f877377634b39b8dd8bb7f69576c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The_E21"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
