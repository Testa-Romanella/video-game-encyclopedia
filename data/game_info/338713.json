Your mission is to defend it from their onslaught of battle ships, and save the galaxy from their reign of terror.<br/><br/><strong><h3>The Game</h3></strong><br/><br/>Infinity Attackers is a basic space shooter game. Your objective is to defend The Infinity from waves of enemies. The Infinity changes position each wave, and every 5 waves a new modifier is added to the game to change things up.
