Basically, you play as a blob named Bentley who has to sort each of the four foods into their respective boxes.</p>\n<p>Spaghetti = Main, Potato = Veg, Chips = Snacks, and Ice Cream = Sweets</p>\n<p>However, Bentley's job is gonna be harder than he thought, as food is literally flying all over the place. There's also candy corn, which nobody likes besides Bentley. So, you have to eat it before it reaches one of the boxes. If it does reach a box, then the box is closed. If all four boxes close, then the game is over.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys = Movement</p>\n<p>Z = Eat</p><p>EDIT: I had to reupload the game because the score wouldn't reset once you reset the game. It should work fine now.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/883/883aadf218821ee0b7ed377d20d0679a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JH Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
