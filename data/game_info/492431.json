The idea is that maps are limited to the screen size and its all that tiny etc. The main problem I encountered was trying to fit too much stats and skill details on such small space.</p>\n<p>This was entirely coded with Lua with the help of\u00a0L\u00f6ve2D framework and it helped me understand a lot better game design process, making clear how I should approach the brainstorm+plan+GDD to avoid wasting time restructuring my code. In the end of this pre-alpha state I'm really unhappy on how I handled lots of things, but really happy that I made it work in general and with some more work it could get really better. After this and my first GameJam experience I think I'm moving into Godot and will start a more consistent project. Maybe I come back to this soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T12:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/716/716edd5650fe7da84210020c8634e6f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ochi Studio"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
