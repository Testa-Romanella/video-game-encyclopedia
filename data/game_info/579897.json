I am writing my final qualification work in nanoelectronics and at the same time I am developing my game.</p>\n<p>Why did I create this theme? I want to share the development of my game, posting the result here in the form of a demo version and screenshots every 1-3 days. I create the game alone.\r\n</p>\n<p>Now a few words about the game. This is a 3D soulslike platformer with a side view and RPG elements. The plot is still in development.\u00a0Development is on unity.\r\n</p>\n<p>The start of the project is Monday, 03/29/2021.
