Zezenia Online features a large map of 4 continents with hundreds of spells, monsters and quests to explore. There are 3 main classes, and you can ascend your character to one of the 7 available subclasses at a later stage in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is created by fans of the old MMORPG Tibia, which explains the similarity in graphics style and gameplay. However, the game is not purely a ripoff or an \"Open Tibia server\", but rather its own game with many unique aspects in game mechanics and \"feel\", that you will notice upon trying it out.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you are into PVP you'll be delighted to partake in the fast-paced and skill-based action the game provides. Should you prefer to play in peace there is a Non-PVP world available as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOther notable game features include dungeons, gathering of ingredients and brewing of potions, player housing, a task system (including boss tasks), battle &amp; soccer arenas and more!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d33/d339d913c05b806e3af0a672f8517eba.jpg", "website": "http://www.zezeniaonline.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 168, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saucer Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Saucer Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
