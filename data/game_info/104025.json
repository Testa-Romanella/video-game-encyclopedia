The further you go, the more you can discover about the Tower. Fight monsters, discover lore, collect power-ups, get a high score!</p>\n<p>Inspired by classic games like Legend of Zelda and Mega Man, Tower of Non is intended to have very simple rules.

Play sessions are intended to be short, but repeatable, so you can play a quick round or get lost for hours!</p>\n\n<p>We plan to add much more content to keep play sessions feeling fresh: more environments, more monsters, more secrets!</p>\n\n<p>Check this game out on Kongregate as well, where high scores get automatically shared: </p>\n<p>http://www.kongregate.com/game...<br/></p>\n\r\nPost screenshots and high scores in the comments!\r\n\n<p>(P.S.
