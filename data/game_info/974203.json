You will have to survive 3 nights using different methods to defeat the aliens including a flashlight, turning power on/off, and closing your eyes (pretend to sleep).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the quiet town of Crestwood, something sinister lurked beyond the starlit sky. The Stevenson family, comprised of John, a high-ranking military officer, his wife Lisa, a scientist, and their teenage daughter, Mia, lived a seemingly ordinary life in their suburban home.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne fateful night, as the family settled in for dinner, an unnatural darkness enveloped the neighborhood. The power grid failed, plunging the Stevenson household into an inky blackness. As the family groped for flashlights, a blinding flash illuminated the sky. Unbeknownst to the unsuspecting Earthlings, an alien race with nefarious intentions had set their sights on Crestwood.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom the shadows emerged extraterrestrial beings capable of mimicking any form they encountered. These shape-shifters, driven by a malevolent agenda, had been observing humanity and plotting their infiltration for years. The power outage provided the perfect cover for their invasion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSilently, the alien doppelgangers assumed the appearance of the Stevenson family, mimicking every detail down to the last freckle. With their disguises in place, they infiltrated the Stevenson home, lurking in the corners like predatory phantoms.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe real Stevenson family, armed with flashlights, cautiously navigated their darkened house. Unease hung in the air as they felt an unnatural chill. Unknown to them, their doppelgangers now sat at the dinner table, their eyes glinting with an otherworldly malevolence.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the power outage persisted, tensions within the household escalated. The alien clones, adept at replicating human behavior, exploited the confusion and paranoia that gripped the real Stevenson family. Whispers in the dark and eerie laughter echoed through the halls, sowing discord among the unsuspecting inhabitants.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe turning point came when John, suspicious of his surroundings, stumbled upon the imposter version of himself. A chilling confrontation unfolded, revealing the true horror that had invaded their home. The alien doppelgangers, no longer able to maintain their facade, shed their human forms, exposing grotesque, otherworldly features.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nA desperate struggle ensued as the real Stevenson family fought to protect their home and each other. The alien invaders, relentless and ruthless, revealed their plan to conquer Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The once peaceful Crestwood became a battleground, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Visit From Above, you are put in the shoes of John Stevenson, after the rest of his family has already been overtaken by their alien clones. Your job will be to keep the aliens at bay until the government broadcasts a special audio frequency harmful only to the extraterrestrials.
