You can escape from a section using only 3 tools: <br/>\n<br/>\r\n- a weapon that opens portals between predefined places <br/>\r\n- a capsule that opens portals between any two points <br/>\r\n- boulders that can be used to open doors<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are several methods by which you can complete a level and it is up to you to find the optimal path. Even if the rules are simple, <br/>\r\nyou must always be careful how you use the tools you have because it is very easy to get stuck in a certain area if you do not follow <br/>\r\nthe right steps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt took us many months of hard work and dedication to create The Forest Prison. We had an exciting time developing The Forest Prison and <br/>\r\nhope you will have the same fun playing it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T03:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/749/749373cc58dde265cbb0e9e3b0960379.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 492, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vlad Cristian"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Vlad Cristian"], "esrb_rating": null}
