A few days after its release, it was featured on the homepage of the website, and quickly gained a lot of attraction.  On january 2019,  Scratch received an update\u00a0 that made the game and its sequels unplayable. Because of this, I've decided, as a small programing project, to port all Shaper games to Windows, while adding some extra levels too. The levels from the original Shaper games can be played in the \"Original\" gamemode in Shaper Collection, while the \"Classic\" gamemode contains new levels.</p>\n<p>Almost every level is unlocked from the start: don't hesitate to skip to the next one if you're stuck.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42d/42da17a628cf2e3449e033a1903e31ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rouli"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
