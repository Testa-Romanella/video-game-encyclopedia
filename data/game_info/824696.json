I actually planned to continue this, doing some stuff during Autumn 2021, but it never really went anywhere after the last version you can see below - though you can download the project files to see the extra scene I began to add! My favourite part of this is the two-person view - it's actually two cameras rendering their views onto their respective RawImage UI widget, which is a great bodge.</p>\n<p>There's a known collider bug that might allow you to go around the track faster, but I never actually tested if it was - see if you can find it!</p>\n<p>- Danakk04</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T16:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/523/5232829b2c6d94cd3be0bbcaeccdb27a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gamer Squids"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
