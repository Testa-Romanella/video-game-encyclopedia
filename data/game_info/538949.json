I share my \"Tower Defense\" game\u00a0 on Google Play. Don't let the pass monsters to the other side with each other's special towers. My advice to friends to play with is that if the monsters get too crowded, you should play in \"x1\" mode. I am already waiting for your evaluations and support. You can Download the game on Google Play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T06:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10e/10e1b35eae2ddecf83f34d2898d4645d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["finisher"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
