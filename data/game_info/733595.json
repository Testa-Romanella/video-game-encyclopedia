I had been playing\u00a0<em>Civilization 2</em>\u00a0and always found it interesting whenever a modern army came into contact with a primitive culture. I felt it should be the subject of an entire game, and dreamed up a cliched plot about going back in time to rule the world 1,000 years in advance! I stirred the pot even further by combining real battlefield action with a\u00a0<em>Risk</em>-style concept of world domination, where each side took it in turns to deploy their units from one territory to another - populated by combatants unique to that part of the world. It wasn't historically or geographically accurate by any means, but it was what the crazy concept required! This version even featured a split-screen multiplayer mode, and was one of my first games to use real sprawling terrain - where hills and rivers made for more interesting battlefields than anything we saw in 2D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acc/accba9d267aee4f22513a30d81e3798d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MDickie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
