{"id": 816336, "slug": "desert-stalker-2022", "name": "Desert Stalker (2022)", "name_original": "Desert Stalker (2022)", "description": "<p>Inspired by the Fallout and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, this game offers an original storyline, involving different factions and side-stories that explore romance, violence and everything in between, sprinkled with a lot of adult oriented content. It has been a long since the apocalypse. You play as a Desert Stalker who scours the violent remnants of an civilisation scattered through sand dunes and destroyed cities in what was once the former Egypt. The aftermath of the war still plagues the lands even after so long, and although your family at home offers a safe and calm haven, you will occasionally be thrown into harsher environments. How you treat others is up to you, as is what alliances you forge, what activities you participate in, and whether you are a self-centered or a more generous character.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T00:13:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eec/eec7618dc71bc714dbeae5bf16e7667d.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/desertstalker", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 275, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zetan"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
