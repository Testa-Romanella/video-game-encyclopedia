{"id": 889633, "slug": "enkai-mn8xr", "name": "ENKAI (Mn8XR)", "name_original": "ENKAI (Mn8XR)", "description": "<p>This year, Unreal Engine 5 brought huge changes to game design and 3d computational power, including real-time fluid fx that have never before been possible. AI has also evolved rapidly to become a creative tool. <br/><br/>We created an alien water world on a lush jungle moon called Enkai. We are using AI on Enkai in several ways, including designing some of the features and characters in the experience, AI music, and AI voice.<br/><br/>* This is FAN art, and is not commercial in nature, and will not use anything from any movie or any direct content other than some blue characters and water. This Concept Art is created with Artificial Intelligence to make story crafting easier and more intuitive. for me. The actual 3d characters we are making are stylized Blueish beings right now, are not giant height, and won\u2019t have tails (most likely).  Some of our characters will have horns and all of them will have different skin colors and patterns than anything else.</p>\n<p>If these Blue characters look at all familiar from a very famous movie, the original creator of those, maintains all their ownership, rights, etc.  This is a fan game, because I waited so long and decided to make something myself as an homage while I wait. And if the creator of that movie, likes my fangame, artwork, storyline, music etc., I offer that all to him freely, from concept art and moodboards, to 3d assets and Unreal Engine 5 source files because what I am making is really neat, and I want to share it. Real time Fluid FX have never really been possible to do in a free Unreal Engine 5 game, and now it is!\r\n</p>\n<p>I have combined my flight simulator Enkai DarkForces with Enkai so there is only one download to play MN8XR games in a 5GB free download. The CC Attribution credits are posted here - Dark Crusades \u2014 Mn8XR<br/><br/>We are looking for other XR artists and Unreal Engine Devs to collaborate to make a next-gen showcase.  If you are interested, please contact us HERE asap, it\u2019s moving fast!<br/><br/>We could use help from Character Artists, Character Animator, Painter Artist, Rigging and Mocap, AI Music creation,  Unreal Engine Devs, Blueprint or C++ Coders, or Virtual Production enthusiasts who want their work in Cinematics and Games the next month or two.</p>\n<p>Gratitude and thanks to our technology partners and supporters:  FluidNinja VFX - Andras Ketzer, KAEDIM 3D, Midjourney, Hoffwerr, and Insectula. This is an initial showcase and BTS of our process with AI and applying AI to the design of interactive media.<br/><br/>We used a 2d image found on open source google search of a floating island, that I feed into the KAEDIM AI via Discord.  Within 15 minutes I had a 30K poly low res 3d mesh that I sent to Insectula to detail in Zbrush and prepare in Unreal Engine 5 with Megascan assets, and dynamic vines and hanging structures that can be controlled by unified wind speed, direction, etc.  This is stage one of KAEDIM to UE, and I am excited to share further results here as we integrate *FluidNinja Live! *Basically the rocket scientist of real-time fluid dynamics visualization :)</p>\n\n<p>Credits and CC Attribution:<br/></p>\n\r\nEnkai DarkForces - Free Fan Game for PC\r\n<p>Developed and Produced by: Anthony Bonnet\r\nXR Creative Director / Unreal Engine Developer\r\nHttps://Mn8XR.com\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a free Fan game, and is not for sale.
