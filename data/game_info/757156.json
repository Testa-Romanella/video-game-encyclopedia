{"id": 757156, "slug": "pressure-balance", "name": "Pressure Balance", "name_original": "Pressure Balance", "description": "<p><strong>Click valves to release pressure and blast all objects to the ground. Knock objects onto pumps to keep the pressure up. If the pressure rises too much the pipes will explode, and if the pressure gets too low, you will run out of steam! Complete all five levels to win.</strong></p>\n<p>A few notes: the goal is to destroy all the physics objects - this can be done by knocking them onto the ground, or onto a pump. You can still finish a level when you have run out of steam, or exploded - you just can't click anything. If objects are about to fall onto a pump and cause an explosion, you can quickly click on other things to let off steam. You cannot, however, let off steam once the maximum has been reached - it is too late. A thing to note about the steam: it actually does more force the higher the pressure is. I wanted this to be more noticeable, but was having trouble balancing it so I left it as it is now (you can just about see steam move faster when pressure is high).</p>\n<p>This game was made for Trijam 161, where the theme was 'Pressure Rises'. Made in 5 hours and 30 minutes - I decided to go over time so that I could add some polish and get a couple levels done. Would love to have added more levels but was over time and needed to finish for the game jam deadline. The sprites (excluding the background which is in the credits) took about an hour to make on their own, but I needed very specific sprites which I couldn't find anywhere else, and I didn't want them to be of different art styles.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Music (shrine): by yd -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/shrine</p>\n<p>Sprite (background): by VilvusGames -\u00a0https://vilvusgames.itch.io/logistics-game-assets</p>\n<p>Sound (steam): by typeoo -\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/typeoo/sounds/521506/</p>\n<p>Sound (multiple FX): by Juhani Junkala -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style</p>\n<p>Font (TT Bricks): by Jovanny Lemonad -\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/tt-bricks-medium-italic-demo-font.html</p>\n<p>Everything Else: by Toby Kellaway</p>\n<p>Game Engine: Unity</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T08:23:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac4/ac44fee81bfd3d91788ac7a369f7443f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tkellaway"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
