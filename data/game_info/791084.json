The idea was for the game to be wacky and creative!\u00a0<br/><br/>It is controlled by a controller for both players:\u00a0the left stick controls the directions of the limbs of the player and the x, y, a, and b buttons on the controller correspond to a specific limb - the idea is to use your limbs as grapples to propel you to the flags that spawn around and whoever gets the most flags wins! it is based on the rock climbing sport but in a low gravity space with the idea, you can interact with the enemy player to halt them back.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T14:40:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ee/8eefaddb10f2e7b8e5e56d4267c470fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
