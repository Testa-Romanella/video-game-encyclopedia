The king of the land, Udom the Wise, made a pact with the Leuce, Queen of all Witches. In exchange for the protection of her kind, his children would co-rule with magical consultants at their side. These consultants were Leuce's own daughters: Lydia, Maria, and Naomi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Udom lived long enough to see his two eldest sons, Louis and Edwin, take the thrones of Elmme and Pyne. Peace reigned, as Naomi watched over the duchy of Oakke until the birth of Udom's third child. Sadly, a tragic accident took the lives of the Queen Regnant and the unborn baby, a tiny girl. The pact unfinished, Leuce washed her hands of the matter and told her daughters to do as they saw fit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both brothers agreed to divide the land equally, but soon came to qualms about what \"equal\" truly meant. Each sister sided with the kingdom she represented, with the youngest caught in the middle between the two. Now, it is up to Naomi to be the peacemaker. Easy in theory, but dangerous in reality:\u00a0every choice could lead to either peaceful resolution, war, or even intervention of the Gods!\u00a0<br/>_____________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p>_____________________________________<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Multiple endings:\u00a0save the country, or destroy humanity?\u00a0</li><li>Multiple pairings:\u00a0who gets married?
