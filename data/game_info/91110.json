At least he'll be paid better. But after arriving at The Chum Bucket, Squidward notices that things aren't quite right here, you must find a way out and Neptune forbid you get caught by Karen along the way...<br/></p>\n<p>The long awaited spin off to 3 AM at The Krusty Krab has finally been released! Only this time, the horrors that lurk within are much more dangerous than a man wielding a spatula for a hand. Complete your objectives and find a way out, but it won't be as easy as you may think. Things are much more trickier than the last game. I won't spoil it all, but trust me, there's more spooks to behold.</p>\n<p>This game was loosely inspired by the episode, \"Chum Fricassee\" and \"Can You Spare A Dime\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdc/bdc72151102615c0ae43f8cbaaf0c071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dave Microwaves Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
