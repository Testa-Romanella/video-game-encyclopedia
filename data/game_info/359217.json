By playing something familiar in a different way you give the biggest muscle in your body a satisfying workout and have fun in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Bounce your brain off one of four textbooks or rely on your left or right side brain to change your direction in mid air. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Challenging levels that WILL take you multiple attempts. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Endless mode which challenges you to keep your brain in the air for as long as possible and beat your prior high score!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Deceptively difficult gameplay. Will you forget to move the left/right textbook while focusing on the top/bottom direction? Will you over use the left and right brain boosts to your own demise? Or will you master the way of the brain?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/78316be9c57ea48439108bcf9093e839.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dr. DreamCrusher"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dr. DreamCrusher"], "esrb_rating": null}
