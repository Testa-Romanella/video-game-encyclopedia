Jammers gonna jam.</p>\n<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Buy Buddies using money</li><li>Reorder Buddies by clicking and dragging</li><li>Trash Buddies by clicking and dragging them onto the trash can</li><li>Enemies get harder each round</li><li>You have a slight advantage over your enemies: your buddies are generated with a slightly higher \"value\" . You might say you have an ... Unfair Advantage. You know ... the theme of the jam!\u00a0 </li><li>Winning awards 5 coins, ties award 3 coins, and losing awards 2 coins.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Things I would have done if I had more time:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Add Buddy abilities to make the game actually fun to play</li><li>Actually \"build buddies\": merge buddies together and add items to them</li><li>Add \"asynchronous\" networking so players can face off against other \"real\" teams.</li><li>Add a \"revive a dead buddy\" feature that lets you bring in a \"real player's\"  dead Buddy. This would create an interesting \"power creep\" dynamic where Buddies get revived over-and-over and get increasing stronger (this was the motivating idea for the Unfair Advantage theme).</li></ul>\n<p>Built with Bevy Engine for Bevy Jam #1.
