You take on the role of a lone r\u014dnin, a clanless samurai who wanders through a small village which has recently been invaded by a horde of demons who have taken up residence in the village pagoda.</p>\n<p>The townsfolk, though weary and defeated, will offer whatever assistance they can while you ascend the pagoda. Armed with only your wooden training sword, you must fight your way through an endless tide of demons to reach the top and confront their general. Be sure to stock up on valuable items from the town\u2019s blacksmith and item merchant as each level is cleared.</p>\r\nFEATURES:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Randomly Generated Dungeons</li>\n<li>Up-gradable equipment</li>\n<li>Deadly monsters and enemies on every floor</li>\n<li>An evolving story as you progress through the dungeon</li>\n<li>No In App Purchases or Advertisements</li>\n<li>Available for: \r\n\t\t<ul>\n<li>Windows</li>\n<li>Mac</li>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>iOS</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Vagrant Sword Homepage</li>\n<li>Lead Developer: Learyt_Tekuzo / Tekuzo</li><li>Character Designer: Koopah</li>\n<li>Environment Artist: Midboss</li>\n<li>Additional Artwork by Adadesign, Dimester, and Laro Saiz Velez</li><li>Title Theme: Misty Mountains</li>\n<li>Town Theme: Path To Lake Land</li>\n<li>Pagoda Theme: Flying Over Lost Worlds</li>\n<li>Dungeon Theme: Unforgiving Himalayas</li>\n<li>Boss Theme: Wasteland Showdown</li>\n<li>Credits Theme: Left Behind</li>\n<li>Misc Sound Effects</li>\n<li>Blacksmith Sound Effect</li>\n<li>Attack Sound Effect</li>\n</ul>\r\nSpecial Thanks To:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Aaron Sokolowski</li>\n<li>Stephen Hill</li>\n<li>Uheartbeast</li>\n<li>Friendly Cosmonaut</li>\n<li>Zach Bell Games</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T02:30:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db14e19af2c63a5a74541c0c19fe6b86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 163, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elektri"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
