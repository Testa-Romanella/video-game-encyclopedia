Find the way out!</p>\n<p>Arrow keys to move, up arrow or space to jump.</p>\n<p>I created this game for a code club I was running in my local library. It's designed to be put together in a series of 1 hour sessions which are fun for the kids and in which they learn some solid coding concepts. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The code club was a huge success, getting good feedback from kids, parents and sponsors. \u00a0But it was closed for\u00a0covid, and many of the parents turned to online, often paid for, resources. I thought I might follow their lead and go online myself. I'm a qualified teacher, I thought, so why not. I'm currently working on a YouTube version of the course, and if that is a success, I'll give Udemy a go. Maybe I'll even make a bit of money.</p>\n<p>The game has also grown on me, so in parallel, I'm developing it as a retro 80's single screen platformer.
