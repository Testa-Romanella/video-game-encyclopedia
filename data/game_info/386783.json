The tree has secondary branches that grow out and also follow the mouse slightly. This allows for a nice wide space to be covered by the tree so it can collect as many of the pickups as possible to increase the height of the tree. The tree's height at the end of the game directly correlates to your score.\u00a0 Remember to balance all the things you collect or else you won't make it very far.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba9/ba9d807c9940ec74348cf98dc3c60b27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["wesleystander"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
