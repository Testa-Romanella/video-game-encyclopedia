However, cosmetically, each character creatively <strong>cuts</strong> to the chase with unique visuals and backstory - making for\u00a0a game that totally <strong>rocks</strong>!</em></p>\n\n<p>Loot boxes? Season pass?</p>\n<p><em>Hahahahahahaha - no.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>So there we have it! It does in fact seem that the game is really quite excellent. Even if the developer does say so himself... to himself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:58:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67d/67d78c5a6609610acd36f91ff8e43a9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["madbookstudios"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
