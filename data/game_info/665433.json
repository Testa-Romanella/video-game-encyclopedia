This theme flows through the story of our protagonist, Remy, as well as the core mechanics of the game. <br/></strong></p>\n<p>An event known as the \u2018fragmentation\u2019 has left the world around Remy fractured, and on the morning of her 18th birthday, she learns that she was adopted after the fragmentation took place. Now committed to learn more, Remy sets off on an adventure in hopes of reconnecting with her birth mother, and to reconnect the world.</p>\n<p>But in order to do so, she will have to help restore the memories of those around her by helping them with their requests. As Remy, you can pick up almost anything you find in the world and even put them in your pocket. Collect memories to bring the islands back together, introducing new areas to explore and items to use.</p>\n<p>In building Fragmento, we were inspired by the woodworking technique known as tenon connecting. When two blocks of wood are connected using this technique, they make a stronger whole. This developed the theme of connecting in our minds and we soon mapped out a narrative that would accommodate this mechanic. </p>\n<p>We set out to design a game that was story-driven, one that enjoyed a relaxing ambience inspired by games such as Journey and Animal Crossing. We set out to make a game that all ages would enjoy; an accessible adventure with an intriguing story that anyone can pick up and play.</p>\n<p>Default Controls:</p>\n<p>Move - W,A,S,D</p>\n<p>Pickup - F</p>\n<p>Speak - G</p>\n<p>Inventory - R</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<p>In the first scene of the game, try to speak with your parents first. Afterwards, pick up the present and try to take it outside to move along with your adventure.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:06:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fe/2fe0d2403c190788a673d4fa9b69f3f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beatriz", "urikoki", "JumpAction", "pragyav"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
