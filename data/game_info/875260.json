The map has a wild west town center surrounded closely by climbable forest!\u00a0Players only have 2 weapons at once and cannot\u00a0reload; they receive a new fully loaded weapon from their loadout upon running out of ammo or choosing to switch a current weapon out. They can also pick up other desirable weapons around the map, such as by climbing a tree. The goal? To kill the other player and to explore the map.\u00a0Be nimble, be creative, have fun!</p>\n<p>This game is currently in development. Tumbleweed is being created by Truman Costello and Thia Broido.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T11:20:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe6900151e515f6ccc44e98e6e73599.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thia Broido"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
