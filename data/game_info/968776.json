{"id": 968776, "slug": "secret-shuffle", "name": "Secret Shuffle", "name_original": "Secret Shuffle", "description": "Gather some friends and put on your headphones: Secret Shuffle is a social deduction party game that combines a dance party with 10 hilarious games and over 20 curated music packs. Through various games, you are challenged to spot other players dancing to the same music, to uncover who doesn't hear any music but dances anyway, to freeze and stand perfectly still when the music pauses, to dance to the sounds of kitchen appliances, and much more.<br/><br/><h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>To get started, you'll need between 4 and 60 players, each with their own phone, the free Secret\u00a0Shuffle\u00a0app from the App\u00a0Store or Google\u00a0Play, and headphones. Set up the steam version of Secret Shuffle on a big screen and have everyone join the party in their app following the on-screen instructions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>One\u00a0player \u2013the\u00a0MC\u2013 selects one of the 10 games and a music\u00a0pack. Once everyone is ready, the round kicks\u00a0off with a brief explanation of the\u00a0game followed by the start of the\u00a0music. What happens next depends on the chosen\u00a0game. Secret\u00a0Shuffle includes 10\u00a0games, with Fakers, Split, and Statues (all three explained\u00a0below!) often being crowd favorites.<h3>FAKERS</h3><br/>Everyone dances to the same music, except for one player; the faker. The faker doesn't hear any music but instead <strong>acts</strong> like they hear the music, trying to remain undetected. At the end of the round, everyone points at who they think the faker is... and then the faker is revealed!<br/><br/><h3>SPLIT</h3><br/>Half of the players dance to the same music. Find each other, dance standing together, and find out at the end of the round if you were indeed listening to matching music.<br/><br/><h3>STATUES</h3><br/>Freeze when the music stops! The slower you freeze and the more you move while\u00a0frozen, the more you will 'crack'. The goal is not to get cracked.<br/><br/><h3>10 GAMES</h3>Besides Fakers, Split, and Statues, the game includes Pairs, Leader, Groups, Possessed, Fakers++, Tree\u00a0Huggers, and Speaker.<h3>20+ MUSIC PACKS</h3>Secret Shuffle's tailor-made 'music packs' are an impressive collection spanning through diverse genres, iconic eras, various regions around the world, immersive sound effects, and special seasonal surprises. Despite the limitations imposed by streaming services, our meticulously crafted music packs are guaranteed to keep everyone grooving.<br/><br/><br/><h3>STEAM VERSION</h3>The Steam version of Secret Shuffle unlocks all games and music packs for unlimited fun at every party you create or join. While you and your friends could technically play a limited version of Secret Shuffle by simply rocking the free app from the App Store or Google Play, the Steam version unlocks all games and music packs and has the added benefit of highlighting what's happening in the game to both players and spectators.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-03T18:48:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/494/4945e8144009609ff36dbb9b4e9f2ee9.jpg", "website": "https://secretshuffle.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Adriaan de Jongh"], "genres": ["Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Adriaan de Jongh"], "esrb_rating": null}
