{"id": 283597, "slug": "mutation-survival-of-the-fittest", "name": "Mutation: Survival of the Fittest", "name_original": "Mutation: Survival of the Fittest", "description": "<p>This game generates enemies using a genetic algorithm. In theory, the enemies adapt to the player over time and the game becomes more difficult. It could be improved upon. Some genes, such as the \"immunity\" gene, can make enemies much more difficult very quickly, other adaptation's effect on game difficulty are less obvious.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The player gains health for the length of time the player is alive, and for killing monsters (and hives). If a player loses health, or if all \"killtargets\" (the green circles) are destroyed, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The objective is to gain as many points as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>MONSTER GENETICS:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each hive generates five monsters per generation. After each generation, the fittest from that hive, and the fittest from all hives are bred together. The weakest for that hive is deleted and replaced by the offspring.</p>\n<p>If a monster gains at least 1000 fitness, and the space is clear, a new hive is spawned next to the hive that spawned the monster that gained over 1000 fitness. These new hives can be destroyed (original hives cannot).</p>\n<p>Genes code for:</p>\n<p>1. Color</p>\n<p>2. Size/speed/hp. Large monsters have more hp, move slower, shoot slower, do more damage per shot and vice versa.</p>\n<p>3. After the monster comes in contact with a player, does it run away or shoot?</p>\n<p>4. After the monster comes in contact with a player and shoots, does it run away?</p>\n<p>5. Immunity to a weapon</p>\n<p>6. How acidic the monsters body is. Highly acidic monsters can melt through walls</p>\n<p>7. Does the monster follow the player, or go after the targets?</p>\n<p><strong>LEVEL DESIGN:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>Levels consist of destructible blocks and indestructible blocks. Part of the map is populated by randomly generated destructible blocks.</p>\n<p><strong>POWER UPs:</strong></p>\n<p>There are two types of powerups: shields and weapons.</p>\n<p>There are three WEAPON powerups. They can be set to the \"secondary weapon.\" <br/><br/></p>\n<p>GRENADES -- detonates after it stops moving due to friction, or by colliding with a monster</p>\n\n<p>BLOCK GUN -- creates pink destructible blocks</p>\n\n<p>FLAMETHROWER -- a stream of flame melts monsters instantly</p>\n<p>There are three SHEILD powerups:</p>\n\n<p>RED SHIELD -- kills monsters on contact. Does NOT block damage from enemy missiles. Goes away after an amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>GREEN SHIELD -- blocks monster missiles. Does NOT kill enemies that come into contact with it. Goes away after an amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>BLUE SHIELD --blocks monster attacks and kill monsters on contact. Goes away after it takes a certain amount of damage.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p>Mouse -- moves crosshairs</p>\n<p>WASD -- moves player</p>\n<p>Left Mouse -- fires pistol</p>\n<p>Right Mouse -- fires secondary weapon</p>\n<p>Mouse wheel -- changes secondary weapon</p>\n<p>Z -- changes secondary weapon to next</p>\n<p>X -- changes secondary weapon to previous</p>\n<p>ENTER -- pauses the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-11T04:22:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/428/4288df76a9f90fe0e0ec82d6aea12c00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ze-e"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
