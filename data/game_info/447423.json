Bloom</strong> and developed by <strong>Jon Oldblood</strong>. Based on real-life experiences, this simple, text-based, story explores the highs and lows of traversing a toxic relationship. Those who have dealt with similar experiences may find some elements of the game uncomfortable.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>No relationship is perfect. We all go through ups and downs, but toxic relationships can feel overwhelmingly difficult, with the hurt and pain far outweighing the good. If you believe you may be in danger in your own relationship, The National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7 at 1-800-799-7233. <br/></p>\n<p>But I did shoot one or two down. <br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to @TinyDuckeii, @ChloraStreaming, and @metagrue for testing the game and providing valuable feedback. The game features music by Kevin MacLeod.
