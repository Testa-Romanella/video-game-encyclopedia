Fortunately there is a magic steak made from the flesh of the ancient gods that looks very jummy. The problem is that whoever dares to touch such a tastefull food will unleash a curse upon himself and the world, traping everyone in a loop. On the other hand, you are hungry.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>You can either play using keyboard (asdw or arrow keys) or controller, although we recomend using controller. You can climb through the vines by pressing the jump button.</p>\r\nTheme\r\n<p>As you play, you play the same level over and over again, just adding enemies to make it more difficult.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>All the assets but the music and sounds were made by us in 48h. Have fun :)</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>You move fast so be carefull. There is an enemy in late stages of the game that may be hard to see if you are not paying attention. The first few levels work as a tutorial too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c8/5c8e8e9073de080e77c6d4dfe8e76756.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["chispaLBC"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
