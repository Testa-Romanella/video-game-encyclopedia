The mole is on the run from the dangerous killer roots that are hot on his heels, speeding up as the game progresses. The mole must keep digging downward to stay ahead of the roots. The mole has the advantage of being able to dash through grubs, killing them and gaining a more powerful dash ability. With this newfound strength, the mole can break through rocks that block his path, keeping him one step ahead of the roots and advancing further down the tunnels. Can you help the mole escape the killer roots and reach new depths?\"</em><br/><strong>- Mole Follows mouse<br/>- Left Click To Dash<br/>- Dash through a grub to gain empowerment<br/>- Dash through obstacles when empowered<br/></strong><strong>- Tunnel through to opposite sides by touching the wall</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:21:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/224/2240a237145c07414dbb13ccf9cad99b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lgarci78", "Vhergo", "ignitusstudios", "Johnsono", "Zdynt", "cameronmakes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
