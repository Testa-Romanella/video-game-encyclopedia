You've been sent to a little island to check out if anything has happened to the lightkeeper, since he isn't answering radio calls and the light needs to be turned on at least for the night.</p>\n\n<p>This little game started as a personal project to learn how to program games and implement audio. It ended up with a cool environment to be explored and listened to. There is a little mistery to be solved, too!</p>\n\n<p>Despite looking like one, it's not a scary game.\u00a0Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d8798285e9542aab6ff007905f5483a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ptkstefano"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
