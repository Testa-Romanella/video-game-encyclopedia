But we all know, that people driving taxis are everything, but common. Not only, because they aren't interested on speed limits, or because the are driving like some race drivers. A lot of lives, important things depend on the talent of Taxi drivers in all the world. Famous cities with taxies are New York, London, Marseille, Tokyo, but of course all major cities are served by taxis. Some are driving yellow cabs, other are driving taxis of different color - The speed limit for all of them is just theoretical. Of course, I know, that taxi drivers never go quick without proper reason, but driving fast can save lives, existences, can solve problems and the speed limit is just a rigid number, nothing else, it doesn't know about the people's problems. But beware! Driving over the Speed Limit is not just against the law, but it's dangerous as well - in real life never try that. Until then you must be driving a nice taxi in the virtual world and who cares of the Speed Limit there? :)<br/><br/>The game uses different interesting control methods, that can be switched in the Settings. <br/><br/>Features<br/>- Unique driving experience with alternate controls.
