Before long, however, things get more hectic. Electrical malfunctions, fires, puddles, thieves, and your manager are hazards to your efficiency and threaten to ruin your customer service.<br/><br/><h3>Help is at hand</h3><br/>Click and Collect features 8 Assists you can purchase with in-game currency to help you manage your customer\u2019s orders. A speed boost gives you that extra spring in your step to get to items and customers quicker. Boots allow you to stroll through puddles without slipping and dropping anything you\u2019re carrying. A fire-proof suit grants resistant to fire for you and anything you\u2019re holding. A mechanic can be summoned to keep your conveyor belt running at the correct speed. The manager\u2019s schedule can be utilised to prevent your manager stepping out onto the shopfloor and berating you if you get too close. A security guard can be summoned to scare away any thieves who mean to steal away customer\u2019s orders. A generator can be utilised to keep the lights on during any power cuts. Finally, a special Assist that clears all obstacles can be used when things get tricky.<br/><br/><h3>That\u2019s strange\u2026</h3><br/>Strange occurrences also threaten to make your quest for customer satisfaction more difficult. Time dilation, random teleportation, bouts of memory loss in customers, these add an extra level of challenge to overcome <br/><br/><h3>Unpredictable</h3><br/>With procedurally generated customer orders and randomly occurring hazards, Click and Collect is a hectic and compelling arcade, strategy action game that keeps you on your toes throughout the 16 standard levels and 4 Endless levels. Keeping a healthy supply of Assists ready to use, and strategising about what customer orders to prioritise is an engaging challenge.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-24T04:22:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc6cbe92ec7ca78a88eea3f10cc29e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peacock Pie", "Greg Giddens"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Peacock Pie Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
