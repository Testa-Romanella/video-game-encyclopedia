I created a bunch of neat features and enemies for this game but sadly couldn't get to making the levels proper on-time so nothing beyond the character selection, first level and a couple cutscenes exist. (And no DCRAWL is not an actual thing, at least not that I know of)</p>\n<p>It's a lazy weekend in the suburbs in 199X, and Billy has invited his friend Kyle over for a sleepover. Billy recently received a copy of the latest version of the dungeon crawler game making program \"DCRAWL\", and is super excited to show it to his friend.</p>\n<p>With tools to a dungeon crawling masterpiece in-hand, the two friends decide to make their own awesome game! But Billy is more of a fantasy fan, and Kyle is into the kinds of dark science fiction that most kids probably shouldn't be allowed to see. With their diverging tastes, will this sleepover turn into a fight between the clash of ideas? Or through the power of friendship will they blend Sorcery and Industry into a DCRAWL 3.0 magnum opus!</p>\n<p>Features</p>\n<ul><li>First-person grid-based movement</li><li>Real-time combat</li><li>Late 90's UI aesthetic</li><li>Imbalanced RPG stats system</li><li>Choose between ranged, melee and magic attacks</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T10:48:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa97215f0a9d47bade4c047d67bfcdb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enygmatic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
