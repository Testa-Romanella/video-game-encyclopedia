{"id": 340370, "slug": "all-hands-on-deck", "name": "ALL HANDS ON DECK!", "name_original": "ALL HANDS ON DECK!", "description": "<p>ALL HANDS ON DECK is a couch co-op party game that takes the chaotic and silly nature of Mario Party and the fast management decision making from Diner Dash. During your time in the sky, the selfmade zeppelin starts falling apart and it is up to you and your friends to work as a team in order to keep in the air.<br/></p>\n<p>The core loop of the game is the players going through a series of events that will damage their zeppelin and influence their movement. The players need to work and communicate together in order to deliver the packages in time and stay in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Events require teamwork and cooperation to solve, for example: the engine in the ship will breakdown, all players are going to get the right supplies and then together they need to repair the engine. They need to communicate who pickups what and when, because this might not be the only problem the crew is facing.</p>\n<p>The game is played by 1-4 players with Xbox controllers.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Amber van Oosterhout (Art)<br/>\r\nBo Vogelzang (Art)<br/>\r\nCosmin-Liviu Rotaru (Design)<br/>\r\nDavid ten Kate (Programming)<br/>\r\nIzabela Dzhundrina (Art)<br/>\r\nLouelle van Rens (Art)<br/>\r\nMax Kruf (Programming)<br/>\r\nRick Heeren (Design)<br/>\r\nSam Martin (Design)<br/> \r\n\"Achiadh Cheide\" by Kevin MacLeod<br/>\r\n\"Nancy the Tavern Wench\" by Alestorm</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T03:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/296db8a4a2832e2139355ab5c4cf7d78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["maxartz15"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
