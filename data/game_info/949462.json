Within this game you'll find magical powers, cursed pickup objects, and a ton of asteroids looking to end your game early. I'm planning to add a few more levels, potentially a timer that will integrate with the score system, and a few more player animations for various actions. Please leave feedback if you see anything that can be improved on, should be taken out of the game, or if you find something you like. All feedback is welcome and appreciated, thank you for playing!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T16:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c970cde2d6494707117f2e04d88ad1d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
