What if any mortal could break that constant? Stretch it beyond its limits? Would human beings finally be able to find a way to cheat death and win over immorality? Or is it Chaos that follows the manipulation of time and gravity?<br/><br/>Constant C is a 2D puzzle platformer with two core gameplay mechanics - Gravity Shifting and the Time Field. Using these two mechanics in the game, the player controls the momentum of various objects to complete each level.<br/><br/>Dive into the world of Constant C, where rules of fundamental physics no longer apply. In a space station far away from Earth, mysterious events have triggered the distortion of time. Journey through the game as a lone robot, who uncovers the truth behind the incident step by step, and finds the purpose of his own creation.Feature<ul><li>Gravitational Shift + Control Time Flow = Momentum Manipulation<br/></li><li>Over 100+ mind-twisting levels<br/></li><li>2D skeletal animation with cute character designs<br/></li><li>Created a unique futuristic, mysterious atmosphere with beautiful lightning<br/></li><li>Kickass soundtracks</li></ul>Gameplay<strong>Gravitational Shift</strong><br/><br/><strong>Momentum Manipulation</strong><br/>", "metacritic": 60, "released": "2014-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:20:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78a/78abd2a0aa20c0b174d2a560965bb587.jpg", "website": "http://constantc.igsplay.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 87, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["International Games System Co.", "International Games System, Co"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Mages.", "International Games System, Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
