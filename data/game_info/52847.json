In April of the following year, Dancing Stage Fusion was released as an arcade game. Fusion featured new gameplay features such as EyeToy support for the PlayStation 2 release as well as new music from hit pop artists. The arcade version of Fusion was the first arcade machine in Europe since Dancing Stage EuroMix 2 and set a milestone as the first Dance Dance Revolution arcade machine produced by Konami since Dance Dance Revolution Extreme in 2002. The arcade release marked a total game engine upgrade from the old PlayStation-based boards to a new system built on top of an off-the-shelf PlayStation 2. This hardware upgrade would be later featured in the global release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe1/fe16e53495f856bc414dfe2b05faff0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation", "PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Konami Digital Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
