Of course, you'll see this is a game far from normal.</p>\n<p>Currently, this game is available in demo version, where we can play all the time as we want, but the referee counts the points as he wants, and we can only play singleplayer.<br/>#arcade\u00a0#sports</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T07:42:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd41f25f33ffb07bac48d4abbaf0ed42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Indiesoft"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
