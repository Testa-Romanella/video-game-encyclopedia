Rather than trying to create legal words that are correctly spelled, you are instead encouraged to spell whatever words you want, but you have to convince everyone else to vote for your word! It's not about spelling, it's about panache!</p>\n<p>To make things more interesting, there is a clue phrase for each round to give you guidance on what sort of word you should create. After everyone has finished creating their word, you all vote on which word best fits the clue phrase. The player with the most votes wins the round. Win the most rounds, and you win the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9f/b9fc496d012c24e5e43bc1783c588a6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["vyrin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
