It is a game where you compete with other players, cinnected to the same local network.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nHow do I play?\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to play, you and your opponents have to connect to the same local network (network dont need to have an internet acces ^.^).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nNext up, one of the players should tap on <em>HOST</em> in game's main menu. They will create a room on their device. Then they have to tap on the <em>question mark</em> button, here they can see their local ip address, which they have to provide to other players in order for them to connect.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nOther players then have to input host's ip address into the <em>room ip</em> field and then tap on <em>connect</em>. If everything went okay, you all will be connected to the host and be ready to play. Ask the host to start the game and compete!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nGame mechanics\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClear the lines to gain points. Scoring goes as it is described in guidlines. When the game starts, it assigns a \"victim\" for every player in the room. So every participant acts as an attacker for someone and as a victim for someone at once. When you clear any amount of lines, this amount gets sent to your victims <em>pocket</em> (4-line clear however sents 8 lines of <em>garbage</em> to your opponent). If you are not performing any line clears in a certain amount of time, your victim's <em>pocket</em> gets empty and the amount of lines which was there gets sent to player's field as some <em>garbage lines</em>. Perform line clears faster and more efficient than your opponents to beat them!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nOther features\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can change app's color theme by tapping the <em>brush</em> icon in main menu.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou can change your username that will be shown to other players (from main menu also).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nYou can watch how other players perform during the session. In order to do so, tap onto <em>question mark</em> icon on the bottom right, then tap onto the <em>eye icon next to the listed player, that you want to watch.\r\n</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/979/979057c5d8d9557804da788dd7a33ea8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Smooth E"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
