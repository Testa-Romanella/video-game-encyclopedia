That being said the beta doesn't count, so the speed run might be thrown in once the game is complete or after as a add on. SpeedRun will have a long amount of levels, and they're will be a timer. Monsters,bosses,platforms,saws,blades and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Info :</strong>\n<p>This game is made by Michael Somerville, in beta and is not done yet. going to work more on it but this is a preview and a vision on what the game is going to be based on\u00a0 give it a try and tell me what you think thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T04:58:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65b1f285436a06b38e5aea69e9f9bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michael Somerville"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
