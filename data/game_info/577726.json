I then tried and got this little alpha out of it.</p>\n<p>LAN only, then you can try it against friends, brother, sister or girl/boyfriend and it is only Windows version - Keyboard and mouse.<br/></p>\n<p>Netcode is what I have a hard time with, so could be cool and get some support for it.</p>\n<p>I have only made the core functions, and the visual must come later, Probably also what come most easily to me. Work with 2D and 3D.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T10:23:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ce/1ce2e868b1f8b9a44bdcd83d6947737a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MNJ3D"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
