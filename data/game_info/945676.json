In the past, because many children in Korean used to die before the first birthdays, the doljabi was a way to visualize a child's future, and believe that they would go on to live a blessed and prosperous life.<br/></p>\n<p>Our goal was to produce a game that allowed for this ritual to take place, and encourage players to reflect on the path they have taken in life, considering not just what they have already done, but what they will go onto do. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T10:29:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/92948123b38a066e44f300abcc714e89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elliot Bear Yu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
