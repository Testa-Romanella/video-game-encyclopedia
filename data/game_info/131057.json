I was only able to work on it for about 8 hours total, but it's a credit to Clickteam software that I was able to get this far.</p><p>Being a tight deadline, many things I wanted to do had to be cut.  There's only 2 levels.  Levels are completed when you destroy all the Spirit Pillars.</p><p>Controls</p><p>Arrows - Move</p><p>Control - Fire Proton Stream</p><p>Shift - Fire Slam wave</p><p>You have to stun the ghosts with the Proton stream.  Then slam them into the wall to destroy them.  If you combine like color ghosts, the slam wave takes on additional properties.  Spirit pillars are only vulnerable to these combo shots.</p><p>The concept is solid, but I'm afraid I went a little overboard on what I wanted to accomplish in such a short time, and the execution isn't so hot.  Perhaps I will revisit this later.  But hey, I finally got to make my Ghostbusters game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f5864abf67be53a223543e9d83c7d498.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shabadage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
