He has 100 health. Kill him to win! He will slowly creep to you as well. Don't let him get you! Edit: In v2 when he reaches 50 health he will throw deadly fireballs at you! Press space to dodge them.</p>\n<p>Edit 2: In Hard Mode the zombie is slightly faster and fireballs are thrown more frequently. Can you beat it? I did. You can do it!!!! &lt;3</p>\n<p>Edit 3: The boss in Story Mode has the same mechanics! It's still space to duck- but you actually jump.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1118a5433f94e9115c487620f90bf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperGamingDude"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
