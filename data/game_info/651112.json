All they need to do is to find the best colonizer. Will it be you? Your mission (if you choose to accept it) is to colonize nearby habitable planets. Or is it a little bit different as it seems? This game will test your logical thinking and entertain you with a story at the same time. Only you and your never silent flight computer flying through space with a live load.<br/><br/>You have to launch a rocket with human cargo from your ship and try to make it land where it should. Other planets, stars, black holes, asteroids and other cosmic objects stand in your way. Some of them you can use for navigation, other mean the end of the trip for a few hundred people.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-06T17:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2f78b1a00b43e72f1b608240d68bd5.jpg", "website": "https://www.spacecolonizer.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ugly Unicorn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Ugly Unicorn"], "esrb_rating": null}
