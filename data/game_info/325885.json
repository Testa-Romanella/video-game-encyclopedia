People will form connections to other and influence their political party in a certain direction. You have the power to cut their connection a prevent the spread of information that would harm your empire. You do this by simply clicking on the connections. However, censoring people doesn't come without consequences. The Tyrant Meter advances by one each time you cut a connection and will enact a more negative effects the further it gets to the red zone. To reduce the Tyrant Meter you've got to get people to forget about your censoring, and you do that by assigning scapegoats. Scapegoat Tokens drop randomly after cutting connections,\u00a0the chance of of which is shown in the upper right and increases the more connections you cut (so don't forget to keep cutting those connections!) Once you click on a token to pick it up you can click on any person to make a scapegoat, temporarily isolating them and severing all their connections. The goal is to survive as long as you can and you earn points by converting people to your political party. You lose when the other party takes over and you're forced out of office!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-07T18:41:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e5/5e5fa04380b9fc5a1e42f3c20177e3f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChristopherPoole"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
