Just follow the crown around everywhere 24/7 and fend off assassins and the like\u2014not that you thought there would be many of those considering how small and nondescript the kingdom is.

To put it frankly, they make you feel like more of a babysitter looking after a toddler with no sense of self-preservation than a knight for a grown adult. They seem to be determined to make your job as difficult as possible, with their insatiable lust for doing stupid, reckless things like sneaking out of the palace in the middle of the night without telling anyone to fist fight a wild animal in the woods, all with an ever-present smile on their face. Perhaps what you\u2019ve really been hired to protect Kallias from is themself\u2026</p>\n<p>Though they love to joke, they\u2019re surprisingly humble for someone who\u2019ll literally rule the entire Kingdom some day. In fact, they don\u2019t really act like royalty, which can probably at least partially be attributed to them spending more time in town than in the palace. The Queen doesn\u2019t know about this though, so <em>shh</em>, don\u2019t tell.\r\n</p>\n<p>Kallias has a lean build, light brown skin, and wavy platinum blonde hair that they try to keep swept up and out of their face. Male Kallias\u2019 hair is short and curls around his ears, female Kallias\u2019 hair is about shoulder length. Regardless of gender, it\u2019s always windswept and artfully messy--and also long enough that it's constantly getting in their eyes so they\u2019re always combing it back with their hands. Their eyes are hazel, but they always look especially green in the sunlight. They have a half-sleeve tattoo as well as multiple small ones in various places, all easy to cover up if they need to. They have eight piercings in each ear and one in their tongue.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Galen [m/f]<br/></strong>The town\u2019s only healer, and also most definitely the only reason Kallias is still alive. They were born with superhuman physical strength, and they have the tree trunk build to match. They\u2019re diligent and responsible which helps them be very good at their job. Alas, they aren\u2019t very personable... yet they\u2019re still almost shockingly popular, always offered warm greetings from the townspeople the rare times they\u2019re out and about in the streets. They never smile back, but they know all the townspeople\u2019s names, and no one seems to mind.</p>\n<p>They look a little intimidating at first glance\u2014and they\u2019re <em>still </em>a little intimidating at the fiftieth\u2014but if you pay attention you\u2019ll notice how gentle they are with their patients, and the care they take to regulate their strength when interacting with others. You'll be hard pressed to find a better healer, much less someone who can heal as painlessly as they do, and given your job you\u2019ll probably be getting to know them pretty well.\r\n</p>\n<p>Galen has a stocky build, warm brown skin, and curly black hair, though despite being so young they have the beginnings of a salt and pepper thing going. Male Galen\u2019s hair is short enough that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about it obstructing his view. Female Galen doesn\u2019t have bangs, just long flowing hair that goes all the way down to her mid back, though she keeps it in a twisted ponytail while she\u2019s working. They have thick eyebrows, and their eyes are gold. If you can manage to get them to smile, you might even discover that they have dimples, but who knows?</p>\n<p>**</p>\n<p>find me on tumblr!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T11:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d9df106c5759377fce7d8c2cb5b89e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cassian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
