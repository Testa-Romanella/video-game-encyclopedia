To destroy a bomb go to it and press space-bar. Then you have one second to go away. The small bombs destroy\u00a0 their\u00a0field and activate a bomb nearby. The big bombs destroy 2 fields up and down and left and right (not diagonal!).\u00a0 The platform has normal fields and broken, last ones disappear when you left them. Find the right combination (there are more than one) to destroy the bombs!</p>\n<p>Later come rainbow-fields. They teleports you to another field. But be cautious, there are no back-teleporter. There are ten levels. (When you are in a deadlock, make suicide, go off the platform)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T09:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a25686593845d2e3fc94e878ecd261f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bardon"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
