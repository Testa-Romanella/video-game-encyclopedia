Back then I made bezier roads, the driving physics and the car lighting.\u00a0After about a month of development I put it on hold, but with the thought of eventually going back to it. Now that I have completed my study it is time to finally finish it.\r\nSince then I've added 8 more levels, made trailers work, added different car types and added collision detection.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-18T04:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9d68b2cb7304804ecaa5405565dc26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Requios"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
