Filled with secrets, but no more than a game to test your reflexes and spend a few minutes beating all of the levels.\u00a0It is just an unfinished idea with basic shapes, so there is not much to see...for now. The whole game seen here is just a small part of a much bigger, different game. If you would like to explore the secrets of this small prototype, give it a try and let me know what you think. But remember: \"There is more to it than what meets the eye\".\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T08:29:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ae/7aec76c6c6edaa9dc76aae70b9b6db8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AfkDev Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
