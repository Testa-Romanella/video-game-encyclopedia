It takes skillful care and nurturing to grow these flowers to their full potential, but once picked, they provide their owner with wisdom. Beware, for there are others who will do anything they can to get their hands on these mystical flowers. You'll need to enlist the help of creatures native to this land to take control of the Lotus garden and achieve true enlightenment.<br/><br/>In Lotus, players take turns adding petals and utilizing guardians to control and nurture these mystical flowers to maturity.  Collect special abilities as you grow to aid you on your quest, and gain wisdom points for each completed bloom.  At the end of the game the player with the most wisdom points will emerge from the garden that much closer to enlightenment!<br/><br/>Vibrant visual effects, skilled AI, meditative environmental music and smooth touch play translate the serenity of Lotus to your phone or tablet. <br/><br/>Praise for the board game:<br/>\u2022 2016 Golden Geek Best Board Game Artwork &amp; Presentation Nominee<br/>\u2022 2017 Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design Origins Awards Nominee<br/><br/>Praise for the board game:<br/>\"Lotus is a game that is beautiful, serene, and even a bit meditative.
