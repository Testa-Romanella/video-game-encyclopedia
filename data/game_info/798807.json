Isla here!</p>\n<p>What you see here is a moment in time. I had wanted to make an RPG to accompany the Swords card game, to expand the lore and make the world of Swords live and breathe a little. As time went on, and life brought on changes, some very personally related to Swords,\u00a0I found myself not returning to work on this project. Yet, I am still proud of the work I had put into this, the soundtrack (also included here) is kinda cool I think, and the lore and battle system here are nice.\u00a0 And any opportunity to look at more of Jeff's wonderful art is great!\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>So I've decided to put out this game as is. It's not finished, many storylines aren't there, there might be bugs, it's not optimized, but you can still look around and find all the characters.\u00a0 Where there aren't stories I have added the lore paragraph for that character, so you still get something. And there's a light version of the card game present in the form of a battle system, so you can mess around with that too!</p>\n<p>A note about the soundtrack: the game has two of most tracks, one for conversation and one for battle, that the game switches between when you enter certain situations. The soundtrack presents each version as their own track, and they are all set up to be looped, so they may cut off harshly or come in loudly etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I recommend that you turn on auto run in the options and that you save manually!</p>\n<p>It's not required, and might be easier to read without it, but the game will use the Swords font if you have it installed:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/unzialish.font\u00a0</p><p>The soundtrack is up on my Bandcamp for free also:\u00a0https://islahinck.bandcamp.com/album/swords-music-for-an-unfinished-game</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support! I hope you find things to enjoy here!</p>\n<p>Game made in RPG Maker MV by me! Music also made by me! Any art that isn't RPG Maker art was done by Jeff Delgado!\u00a0https://twitter.com/Jeff_Delgado</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Isla</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:19:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f858f0646a86e3da7118898d20b85173.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Isla Hinck"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
