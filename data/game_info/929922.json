What? you truely think\u00a0 you're not in the right place? Hmm well you can always try to escape, like others once tried. Here take this <strong>grappling hook</strong>, the way to heaven is straight upwards. And you know what? I'll give you a <strong>handy deal</strong> from time to time at the best prices you will ever find down here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONCEPT</strong></p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Down Bad\u00a0</strong>we tried to explore the world of dual purpose design. Using one action to combine multiple effects. The grappling hook the player has can be used to move towards higher points, but also to get rid of enemies. Killing enemies makes the traveling easier and grants the player soul currency. This currency can be used in the devil deals. A handy shop where souls can be used to purchase valuable upgrades to make the climing easier. However every upgrade bought also rises up the level of the lava, scaling down the player playfield.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is endless and will propose a bunch of well-thought level sequences. How higher the player gets, how bigger his score.\u00a0 The levels will keep going faster as long as the player is able to survive, making shops also a possibility to breath out for a few seconds.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>TEAM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bram Van Geel</strong>: Programming &amp; Level Design</p>\n<p><strong>Joachim Gos</strong>: UI &amp; Visuals</p>\n<p><strong>Maxime Smit</strong>: Programming &amp; Sound FX</p>\n<p><strong>Vincenzo Didion</strong>: Visuals/Animation &amp; Level Design</p>\n<p>SONG: The False Waltz : Vincenzo Didion</p>\n<p>(Tbh we all did a bit of everything in a chaotic mess but it looks better like this)</p>\n\n<p><strong>All ellements in this game are original content please do not try to sue us :)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T13:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31e9ab986acc31179e5d6d4cd1830b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veomix", "IronWaffles23", "Lord_Vizenco", "BeatsBydour"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
