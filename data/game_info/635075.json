Using similar mechanics, in each of its 30 levels, <strong>Follix</strong> challenges the player to build a piece of a message by sliding in the correct places the tiles that contain the relevant text characters.</p>\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follix</strong> has been written in <strong>AMOS Professional</strong> 2.00, without third-party add-ons. However, thanks to the self-produced ALS engine, it is a proper <strong>AGA</strong> game. It sports 8 bitplanes, 24-bit colors, multiple layers, translucency, (cross)fade-in/out effects, alpha-cycling effects and crystal clear audio (including 14-bit speech samples)!</p>\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AGA Amiga</strong> computer</li>\n<li>700 kB of CHIP RAM</li>\n<li>350 kB of other RAM</li>\n<li><strong>PAL</strong> display</li>\n<li>stereo loudspeakers</li>\n<li>joystick/joypad and/or keyboard</li>\n<li>760 kB of disk space (if installed)</li>\n<li>5 units of NVRAM (on an Amiga CD\u00b3\u00b2 without other storage capabilities)</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T09:35:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45a/45a60332e1ab8fc64f6f771a60fbb60e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
