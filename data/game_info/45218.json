In order to reach their goal players must throw balls to hit platforms in specific patterns. Platforms have unique properties and machanics that change from chapter to chapter. The game starts with simple static levels and quickly incorporates new mechanics as moving platforms, bouncer platforms and portals.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPhysical characteristics of Hurl VR players play huge role in how the game will be experienced. A player of shorter height might find it extremely easy to complete levels that require low and tactical throws, whereas taller ones might find it really challenging and vice versa. By giving each player a completely different experience the game design of Hurl VR makes it not only an interactive puzzler, but a funny party game as well.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d2/4d2156e90305f32a79cdae851ef3011f.jpg", "website": "https://hurlvr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 28, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rusty Oak"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rusty Oak"], "esrb_rating": null}
