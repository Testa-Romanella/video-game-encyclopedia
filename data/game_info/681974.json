It was a massive success, but it could've been much different.

You were busy finding games when you find a strange N64 cartridge on a shelf. Its label was peeled off and there was no indication of a title. They end up giving it to you for free and you happily bring it home. What you don't know yet is that you found a beta cartridge for Super Mario 64. Once you begin playing, you might not know what lurks behind that CRT screen.</p>\n<p>This is more than\u00a0just a game.</p>\n\n<p>All rights go to Nintendo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8c/c8cfe073616c72925133a6b64b4b7c73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["neverhood2003", "scorcy66"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
