Drop these bombs on the attacking exploding sharks to blow them up and keep your goods safe. The more sharks that hit your ship, the less valuable your goods become. And be careful: your ship will sink if you let too many through.</p>\n<p>You can upgrade your dropper to make it faster, and reduce the time it takes to drop bombs.
