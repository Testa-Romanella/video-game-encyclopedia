You see, Ribert was new to the area and didn\u2019t know how things worked in this neck of the woods, making the frog easy prey for those who would take advantage of him. Bruce the Bat, being one such creature, lured Ribert into collecting as many coins as they could, only to steal them viciously, leaving our hero flat croak.</p>\n<p>That day, Ribert took up the iconic red bandana and the shuriken to seek revenge upon Bruce. To do so, Ribert must chase and follow the thieving bat through various levels and eliminate Bruce\u2019s bat mafia, figuring out the various puzzles along the way.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how Ribert the Red became the master of FROGJITSU!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44fdeb78d9ed00dc0752cd2038425f62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fowlgon", "Geoffrei F Willingham", "darkbitterbrew", "AfkQueen"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
