{"id": 796682, "slug": "nibulus-kick-asp", "name": "Nibulus - Kick Asp", "name_original": "Nibulus - Kick Asp", "description": "<p>DISCLAIMER - This program is presented for archival reasons and is both unfinished and abandoned. It is not much more than a prototype and users should not expect a complete or polished experience.</p>\n<p>It seems to be playable WITH AN XBOX CONTROLLER. It CANNOT be played with keyboard/mouse. I have not tried any other brand of controller.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------</p>\n<p>This was, I think, my third attempt at making a game called Nibulus, the first effort being a simple Flash app that was a cross between a 'snake' game ('Nib' coming from 'Nibbles', an early PC snake clone) and Nebulus, an 8-bit classic (WoS). The revolving tree view has always been a part of the game, but, this time, the gameplay became something more akin to a fighting game - Hence \"Kick Asp\".\r\n    </p>\n<p>It was possible to kick out at your opponent with the end of your snake's tail, and also bite. With some effort, your opponent's snake could be bitten in half!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Roughly speaking, the left snake can be controlled with the controller's left stick and the right snake with the right stick.</p>\n<p>The left snake will open it's mouth to bite by pressing LB. RB is for the right snake. Let go to bite.</p>\n<p>The tail of the left snake can be controlled with the D-pad. The right snake uses X, Y, A &amp; B.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T14:52:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a464c789e46390394e31ebcf51246e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ric Haines Makes Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
