You have to find the <strong>right balance</strong> between health and damage,<strong> don't be too greedy </strong>!</p>\n\n<p><strong>No WebGL build, I'm sorry I tried to make it work but the UI is scaling really bad and I can't understand why it's so complicated to get working the webgl on Unity.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Known Issues :\u00a0</em></p><p><em>- The card behaviour is weird sometimes, it's the best I can do without rewriting the whole script from scratch.</em></p><p>- Sometimes the cards can become smaller and smaller, I didn't had this problem with my 1080p monitor, a quick fix can be to play in 1920x1080.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:46:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f54dc69bad578ce94ec968e93b6d2f7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DayMoniakk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
