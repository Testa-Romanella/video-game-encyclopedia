There are also barriers that you cannot\u00a0cross or else your rocket will blow up and you will die. BUT, WAIT!!!!There is a catch. During your voyage you may encounter a elephantine\u00a0meteor that blocks your way leading to NO escape. Or is it, well\u00a0here's a hint for you to cheat your way through the meteor.
