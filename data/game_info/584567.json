However, there is a lack of electrical outlet in the school, so you will have to traverse through the long, narrow hallways, avoiding haphazard objects such as puddles of water, paper airplanes, class clowns throwing bananas at you, and a bunch of bullies.</p>\n<p>However, you are also able to zap and whip the enemies with your electrical cord by pressing Z and X, though zapping will make you lose battery power, so use them wisely.</p>\n\n\n<p>Note: There is a bug where the camera might stop moving.\u00a0 If that happens when playing you have to reset the game from the pause menu.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:50:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/8517d671e6c883716459a9cab5e75579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheGreatIdiots"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
