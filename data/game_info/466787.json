The game's numbers and setting spiral out of control through\u00a05 different phases:</p>\n<ul><li>Office life</li><li>City life</li><li>Political life</li><li>Space life</li><li>???</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD/IJKL/arrow keys: move</li><li>Spacebar/shift/X/left click: interact</li><li>R/escape: restart level (<strong>very important</strong>)</li><li>In battle, use the mouse to select actions.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n<p>This is a hybrid between a puzzle game and an RPG. It has similar mechanics to a simple turn by turn RPG, with the main mechanic being that you can steal the enemy's move/HP/identity. However, you should approach it like a puzzle game, because you must figure out the best battle order to maximize your stats and abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Ressources:</strong></p>\n<p>All coding and art were made during the allocated jam time, the music was composed before the jam, as allowed.</p>\n<ul><li>Code and music: Adrien Dittrick</li><li>Artwork: Shinlalala</li><li><em><strong>The Game Maker Studio 2\u00a0 source code is available to download</strong></em>.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:03:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b02/b029e6fa53d9a8f6c447644002a32c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["adriendittrick"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
