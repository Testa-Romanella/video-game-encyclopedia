Weld swords and guns onto a haunted monster truck and do flips, and customize your car to be as weird as possible!<br/><br/>Future versions will involve exploring a futuristic version of Sydney called Scramble City, meeting characters, doing quests, competing online, and preventing the dark forces of an unethical quadrillionaire conspiracy theorist from taking over the world.</p>\n<p>Anyway this is super unfinished, so expect bugs and jank. I'll eventually update this to make it a bit smoother.</p>\n<p>https://www.patreon.com/maenadgames</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/CarfuHelljam<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T07:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/71988fd951591416d1b84fb8001ca80b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaenadGames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
