Instead we will use things like sound, rumble and light. We believe it could give the game a more sensational aesthetic instead of clearly telling the player by prompts.\"</p>\n<p>This prototype showcases what we made,\u00a0a system that can guide the player using things such as sound, visual cues and rumble. We feel like we came pretty close but that it would be even better in the context of an actual game to fully show what it can be used for.</p>\r\nWe made this!\r\n<p>This prototyped system is a student project made for the Advanced Game Design course at Futuregames Higher Vocational Educations in\u00a0Stockholm, Sweden.
