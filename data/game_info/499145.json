This means that fundamental aspects like enemy attacks and sound effects\u00a0couldn't make it in.\u00a0That being said, we completely respect the conditions of the jam, and we don't expect to be judged differently\u00a0even if it is incomplete.</p>\n<p>SoulSnatcher is a 2D top-down hack-and-slash action game about the Reaper, a shadowy entity who must\u00a0pursue Wisps and consume their Souls to illuminate\u00a0the endless void around them. Armed with a blazing Lamp Scythe, the Reaper can rend through Wisps with swift Dash Slashes, which can be\u00a0chained together in quick succession with enough skill. Should they wander too long without light, however, the Reaper will be reclaimed by the insatiable darkness.</p>\n<p>Currently, the game only supports keyboard and mouse controls.</p>\n<ul><li>Move - WASD</li><li>Aim - Mouse Cursor</li><li>Dash Slash - Space</li></ul>\n<p>SoulSnatcher was developed in 1 week for VimJam: Collectibles, by members of Trisagion Games.
