Using portals scattered around the floating lands to solve puzzles and advance,\u00a0Asuna must restore the\u00a0<strong>Ancient Life Crystals</strong> and defeat the evil to stop\u00a0the\u00a0tremors\u00a0from ripping\u00a0the\u00a0islands\u00a0apart. Join Asuna through her journey across the beautiful <em>Light Plains</em> and the dangerous <em>Dark Plains</em> of the islands and help guide her through her journey.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Asensa's Ascension is designed to be a journey and an experience traveling through beautiful and dangerous floating islands. There are no loading screens, and no save points, and even though you can be hurt and faint during combat, there is no health bar or UI\u00a0to be concerned with. If you faint you are simply teleported back to the portal from which you last came. Feel free to quit at any time, your progress is saved as you go. This game will receive updates and content expansion through its development.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T15:58:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/3498a00a919bef8ba2a5c8c04d81b7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shumaro", "eiji.jm", "darinius"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
