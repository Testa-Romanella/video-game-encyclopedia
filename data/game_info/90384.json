We've been designing and implementing tons of new mechanics, controls, levels, and more! Now that we have a good idea of the overall scope, story, and new features in the Supremo Edition (plus that we realistically can only work on the game over weekends), we've decided that our original goal of end of Summer was a bit ambitious. We are now aiming for an early 2017 release and we're going to try to post more frequently than we have been.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFor now, here's a quick screenshot of one of the break rooms where you can acquire more coffee from a coffee machine if you've spilled too much:\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\t Thanks again for the millionth time for your support!</p><p>\r\n\t/Team Meeting Games.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>June 11th: Thank you again!<p>\r\n\tWe've been Greenlit on Steam! Thanks so much for your enthusiastic response yet again! We're working hard on the Supremo Edition and will have some surprises to share over the next couple of months. Time for some celebratory coffee!\r\n</p>May 23rd: New Patch, Greenlight, Supremo Edition!<p>\r\n\tHello fellow coffee spillers! Once again, we feel the need to say how excited we are that so many of you have been enjoying our silly little game. We made this over a weekend and thought that maybe a few of our friends would try it out, but never could we have imagined how strong of a response it's been getting! Thank you all so much.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnyway, we have several exciting updates for you today:\r\n</p>First off, v0.2.6 is live!<p>\r\n\tThis fixes some of the last lingering technical issues that we've seen in videos or were told about. Specifically:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Fixed rapidly flickering Caffeine Boost meter when playing in super high frame-rates.</li>\n<li>Fixed the level select buttons when using the mouse to select them.</li>\n<li>Fixed the broken dancers in the Dance Party level. Sorry for all of you who had dancers just standing there, that's not much of a party.</li>\n<li>FINALLY fixed the first sensor activation stall that was plaguing everyone. Sensor activation was pretty much re-written from scratch and it now consistently works every time I try it.</li>\n<li>A number of optimizations and performance improvements.</li>\n</ul>Next, on to our future plans!<p>\r\n\tThanks to your enthusiastic response and support (seriously, you're all amazing), we have begun work on a full-fledged version of our game! We are incredibly proud of what we made when we were constrained to 48 hours of development for a Game Jam, but now we have a chance to really create a solid game through and through. We are calling it \r\n\t<strong>Don't Spill Your Coffee! - Supremo Edition</strong>. It will be a brand new experience with a multitude of new features and content.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWhile we are still designing and brainstorming ideas, The Supremo Edition will definitely be including:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>An entirely new campaign with completely re-done level art!</li>\n<li>Multitudes of rooms and locations with brand new puzzles requiring all kinds of new contortions!</li>\n<li>Tons of new customization options!</li>\n<li>Some semblance of a plot!</li>\n<li>Brand new mechanics, including...using your right hand!</li>\n<li>Local Co-op play!</li>\n<li>A number of secrets!</li>\n<li>...and lots of things that we haven't come up with yet!</li>\n</ul>We're now up on Greenlight! Vote for us!<p>\r\n\tWe have just now submitted Don't Spill Your Coffee to Steam Greenlight! We need your support to get it on Steam, which will help us out greatly to make the Supremo Edition possible. The Game Jam version will remain up for Pay What You Want on itch.io (and the Supremo Edition will be added as a separate download on itch.io when it's ready), but the Steam version will always be the latest version!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tJust click \r\n\tthis link and say that you would want to buy this game if it was on Steam!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p>It's a Team Meeting, Get it?<p>\r\n\tLastly, we have come up with our dev name. From now on, the three of us are collectively called \r\n\t<strong>Team Meeting Games</strong>. It's a terrible pun, but we love those.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks yet again (we can't say it enough!) There are some fun times ahead!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t/Jared, Mike, Jon.\r\n</p>May 17th: v0.2.5 Is Live!<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tJust a quick update! I think I have found the issue with some people being unable to turn their character, despite all of the other controls working. I'm still looking into what is causing the game to hang for a second the first time the first sensor is activated. I've tried two different approaches, but neither has solved it yet. I'll try to solve it for real for the next version!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThanks again for all of the interest. We should have some exciting news soon!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t/Jared.\r\n</p>May 15th: v0.2.3 Is Live!<p>\r\n\tFirst off, thank you all so much for the enthusiastic response to Don't Spill Your Coffee! This is miles beyond the attention we thought we would ever get and we have laughed at so many of the videos everybody is posting. We're now motivated to push out bigger and better releases! But first, some steps had to be taken to stabilize the code beyond Game Jam code quality. There's still a lot of foundational work to be done before more feature-rich updates get pushed out, but I've addressed some of the more jarring issues that I've seen in various videos:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>The first time the first door sensor is activated, the game should no longer hang for a second or so.</li>\n<li>The coffee stains should no longer clip through the ground (especially at the second camera angle).</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the levels would repeatedly skip automatically when moving around the turnstile in the score screen.</li>\n<li>Various performance optimizations and stabilization.</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tThanks again!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\t/Jared, Jon and Mike.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfe/dfee2b1bdcc67b7e3f74bae70242128a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Meeting Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
