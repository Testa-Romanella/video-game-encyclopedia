I loved that game. In the later years I have wanted to play it again but was not able to find anything similar to it. Hence Local Airspace was born.<br/></p>\n<p>The look of the game has been updated somewhat but the core concept is still the same.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your job is to guide airplanes in your local airspace safely to their destinations. You will start working the night shift at a small municipal airport. When you finish your shift successfully you will be promoted to a busier shift, or possibly to a larger and busier airport. You will always start with the night shift when you move to a new airport.</p>\n<p>Some airports may have areas with mountains where you have to make sure the airplanes maintain a minimum altitude. There can also be areas where no airplanes may fly.</p>\n<p>You will be fired if you let an airplane crash into the ground, a mountain or another airplane. Letting a plane enter a restricted area is also grounds for immediate dismissal. You will also be fired if you get 5 warnings in a single shift.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-21T04:46:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54bf3dffba26328f4284d69c068a155.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rinky-Dink Entertainment"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
