You can design and program your own soldiers and make them fight against your friend's soldiers.</p>\n<p>TCBS is inspired by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator by Landfall. It uses Pygame 1.9 and Python 2.7 but still works in Python 3. TCBS also uses PodSixNet written by chr15m (Chris McCormick).</p>\n<p>PodSixNet for python3.4 by tborisova (Tsvetelina Borisova) is also used so that some multiplayer features work in Python 3. However, trying to connect to a Python 3 server using a Python 2 client (And vice versa) will result in an exception.</p>\r\nRelated Links\r\n<ol><li>Known Issues:\u00a0https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/TCBS/issues</li><li>Wiki:\u00a0https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/TCBS/wiki</li><li>Source Code:\u00a0https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/TCBS</li><li>Virtual Environment:\u00a0https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/venv/</li><li>Releases:\u00a0https://github.com/ROTARTSI82/TCBS/releases</li><li>Website:\u00a0https://rotartsi82.github.io/TCBS/</li></ol>\n\r\nHow to Install and Run\r\n<ol><li>Download\u00a0<strong>TCBS for Mac</strong>\u00a0below</li><li>Unzip it, and drag\u00a0<strong>TCBS.app</strong>\u00a0out of your downloads folder.</li><li>Right click (Two-finger click or\u00a0<strong>ctrl+click</strong>) on\u00a0<strong>TCBS.app</strong>\u00a0and select <strong>Open</strong></li><li>A window would pop up saying\u00a0<strong>TCBS\u00a0</strong>was downloaded from the Internet or that it's from an unidentified developer.
