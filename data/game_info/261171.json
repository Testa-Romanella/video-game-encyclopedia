As Batman, you will infiltrate a mafia boss manor in order to solve a case that could result in a mob war in Gotham.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SUPER BASIC LOCOMOTION</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD for moving around</li><li>Mouse for moving the camera</li><li>Left click for throwing some punches!</li></ul>\n\n<p>This is an end-of-term assignment I got from school in which we had to redesign a comic book character (and their sidekicks) in designated themes. In my case, I chose Film Noire for the pairing of Batman and Catwoman (went with a classic). And besides redesigning them, we had to make them game-ready and make a short game or just showcase them with basic locomotion\u00a0inside a world using Unreal Engine 4.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Even coming up with a name was totally optional, but I decided to give it a twist, haha.</em></p>\n<p>Which means this is just a demo game I'm sharing with everyone to bring a little fun to your day. Can be played fairly quickly and the music is quite fun to listen to while punching the bad guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>\n<p>If you would like to make some awesome mini games with me, fill free to contact me and we will see how to make it work!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Artstation<br/></p>\n<p>Linkedin<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>SPECIAL THANKS TO</strong></p>\n<ul><li>All my professors, teacher assistants and classmates at school (Vanarts)</li><li>Carlos Carbone for his support and patience teaching me the programming part.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91c/91c5ca0208430c6d2732f7ed9c7762d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Diana Ulloa"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
