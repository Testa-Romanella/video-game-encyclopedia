Instead you have to constantly balance your avarice and cowardice, building up bonuses and choosing the ideal moment to bank your points before you are destroyed.</p><p>The theme was maximum capacity and I interpreted that as a risk/reward mechanic where you increase your bonus gauge as you approach maximum capacity, but you also increase your hit box and risk destruction, losing all your unbanked points.</p><p>Team:<br/>- Michael Noland (@joatski, http://michaelnoland.com)</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Move with WASD, ZQSD, or Arrow keys</li><li>Fire with Space or LMB</li><li>Bank with Shift or RMB</li><li>Escape to Quit</li></ul><p>How to play:</p><ul><li>Enemies are made of delicious coins, so you should shoot them</li><li>They are very protective of those coins, so avoid touching them or getting shot by them</li><li>Eating coins increases your bonus gauge but makes you fat</li><li>Banking protects points at the cost of draining your bonus gauge</li><li>Aim to beat your own high score and improve your average bonus rating</li></ul><p>Additional Credits:<br/></p><ul><li>Used resources from several UE4 samples (allowed as part of UE4 EULA)</li><li>'Lives left' icon from Kenney (CC0 license)</li><li>'Drag racing chimes' sound from http://freesound.org/people/steel2008/sounds/23127...
