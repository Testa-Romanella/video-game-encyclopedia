To do this, they seek a legendary artifact called the Red Genie.</p>\n<p>-Combining old and new-school ideas, fight battles in turn-based action with a weapon swap system that allows The Adventurer to freely swap between up to 10 different weapon types during battle!</p>\n<p>-Along with 200* weapons across all types and 150 armors and charms, master Magic and Techniques to utilize your arsenal at its highest levels! There's sure to be a build for you! Specialize in weapons or master the arcane - build The Adventurer to your preferences!</p>\n<p>-Take part in the mystery of the story of the Red Genie and discover the truth in the full version due to release in April 2023!</p>\n<p>This demo also has a survey linked in the Credits of the game in the Main Menu.
