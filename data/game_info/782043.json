You must survive a home invasion by keeping hidden and restoring power in order to call the police. You must listen carefully to your surroundings\u00a0to avoid being spotted - the game requires you to hunt various items which are hidden in random locations, making each game different and just as\u00a0challenging.\u00a0The game is underpinned by a pathfinding AI that hunts you around the map. It understands the layout of the house and\u00a0you must outsmart it in order to evade it.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm a 17-year-old finishing my first ever game, and seeing it come to life has been awesome. I hope it is as enjoyable to play as it was to make.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can contact me at\u00a0<em>cowboytoadteam@gmail.com</em>\u00a0- I'd love to hear feedback or suggestions for bugfixes. Alternatively, comment on this page.
