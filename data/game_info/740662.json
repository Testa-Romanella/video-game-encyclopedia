Assume its all bread) will be deleted and you will be given a rating from\u00a0<strong>Eh..</strong> to <strong>SWEET</strong>, which will determine how many points you earn.<br/>Hitting several consecutive notes will give you a multiplier, which multiplies the score you get. <br/>Conversely, failing to hit a note will give you some <strong>TOAST</strong>, which also acts as a multiplier, but having too much will end your run.<br/>This system leads to higher highs and lower lows. Someone could fail miserably early and come out with a pretty good score, or someone could choke at the end and end with a miserable score. It's like random crits, but actually good.</p>\r\nCredits!\r\n<p>Code, Game Design - ColdCalzone<br/>Art - ColdCalzone, Symile Silversteen, Blaise Rascal<br/>Music - JohnGabrielUK, Taylor Kirkwood</p>\n<p><strong>Some assets in the game (particularly achievement icons) have been inspired or adapted from art from M0TH3R, this art was made by<br/>D4yz<br/></strong><strong>Willowblade</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T08:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/383/383a4a89de5cfa064b318c6fb1b6b669.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ColdCalzone"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
