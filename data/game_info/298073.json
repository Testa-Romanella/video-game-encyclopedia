It is a short puzzle/platformer game that is meant to be speedrunned. The reason why I upload the game early and also why the game is not too\u00a0 polished is that I were not at home for the rest of the jam, otherwise the game had been more polished and bigger.</p>\n<p>So, when it comes to credits and\u00a0 that stuff, I am really\u00a0 happy\u00a0because I did not have\u00a0 to use much code from others even though I am an amateur when it comes to game developing. I programmed like 97-98% of all code myself, all assets I made the music.\u00a0Though the font I used for most of the game is not mine: it is called ZCOOLQingKeHuangYou-Regular.</p>\n<p>The game is available for windows right now, might make mac-suff when I get back after the jam, I don't now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game in its current state is a bit buggy, however it is definetely playable.</p>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<p>-Background can't be deleted after you have played once.</p>\n<p>-Clip through walls, boxes.</p>\n<p>-and more</p>\n<p>I had been really happy if you tried the game out and leaved\u00a0 some criticism in the comments.</p>\n<p>This were the first game I have ever completed and it was also my firt ever game jam.</p>\n<p>I've learned so much of this jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-01T05:27:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97abcb270efb752af9586dec057cae7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Freezerbot"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
