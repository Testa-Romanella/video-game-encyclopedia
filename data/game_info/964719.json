Finally, there's a new Sven B\u00f8mw\u00f8llen game to get it on with!</h3><br/>It\u2019s gettin\u2019 hot in here, because here he COMES again!<br/>After a 16-year long beauty sleep, the black ram is back to plough the fields with renewed energy. But not that of the senile shepherd Lars, but of his countless other sheep. Because after such a long wait, Sven has built up pressure. A lot of pressure!<br/><br/><br/>Discover <strong>over 25 ways</strong> to dance the horizontal tango, churn the butter and plant the parsnips. Not only Sven has needs after such a long time: The sheep are also just waiting eagerly to finally be seduced again. <br/><br/><br/>The longer they have not been satisfied, the more frustrated they get. So Sven is doubly motivated to knead the dough and put the bread in the oven.<br/><br/><br/>But beware of shepherd Lars and his attentive dog Wotan, because they both guard the flock with watchful eyes. If they catch Sven on his love odyssey, it's high time to scram. If they catch him, all the fun and games are over.<br/><br/><br/>For the first time, it is possible to dance the no-pants-dance in real 3D. This not only helps to get a better overview of the animals waiting to be made happy, but also to love through the world more smoothly. Sven\u2019s movement has been improved as well as the AI of Wotan and Lars revised to make for exciting rounds and requiring a tactical approach for the most beautiful affair in the world.<br/><br/>In addition, for the first time in a part of the Sven series, it is possible to start an orgy with up to 4 players. No pants\u2019ll stay dry.
