{"id": 795819, "slug": "grocery-dash", "name": "Grocery Dash", "name_original": "Grocery Dash", "description": "<p>Game for ARTG-120/CMPM-120 created by Laihong Xu, Evan Lew, and Tiange Wei</p>\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Scramble to find all the ingredients on your grocery list before the store closes. Be careful to not make the time limit force you to pick bad quality ingredients. But, at the end of the day try not to miss any ingredients on your list.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>There are two stages in the game: stage one is where the player picks their items and the second stage is where the player puts the ingredients together.</p>\n<p>In stage one the player can click on items to put them in their cart. The player can right click on any item to see the quality of the item that can range from bad to normal to good. Every item has a different visual distinction that tells the player the quality of the item. Switch between the aisles as much as you want, but be cautious to the fact that switching aisles too much might hurt your time when having to wait for items to spawn.\u00a0As the player picks items that match their given recipe list, their budget will go down depending on how much a given item costs. Once player is ready or time runs out the player will go to stage two.</p>\n<p>In stage two the player will put all the ingredients they bought together. The player can follow the recipe list or they can put ingredients together that they already know are valid recipes in order to get points.</p>\n<p>The more you play the game the more recipes you will learn and be able to use when entering the second stage. Every game the recipe list will be random. Every time you move to a new aisle the items will spawn randomly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Main Programmer - Laihong</p>\n<p>Art - Evan</p>\n<p>Additional programming - Evan and Tiange</p>\n<p>Idea and concept for the game - Laihong and Evan</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T08:21:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/880/88016f4587cf93156d96c208b1f208cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Evan Lew"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
