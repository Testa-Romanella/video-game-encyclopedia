It surprised me how well it worked out.\r\n</p>\n<p>Actors management. the function create_enemies on the 4th tab is the properties of each actor(powerups, enemies, NPCs, etc...). Each actor has a type, and according to it's type, it gets it's custume properties, such as sprites, width, height, ai etc...\r\n</p>\n<p>The Ai of the enemies is also modular, as each block of the ai can be called with it's name, in the AI table.\r\n</p>\n<p>sprite_builder() is the function that builds each enemy from different sprties and handles it's animation properties. Took me some time to get it to work well, and I was able to do with some really amazing enemies.\r\n</p>\n<p>In conclusion This game was really fun to made and I hope it will be fun for you to play</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T15:07:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e17/e17496c267faadf3b1a6dbb0bf45e834.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mikimation"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
