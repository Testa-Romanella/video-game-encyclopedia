The game seamlessly interweaves robust runner-like gameplay mechanics with an engaging story, which has been previously unexplored or a weakly employed combination in endless runner games so far. Our goal is to provide a compelling narrative experience without the expense of fun gameplay, and player learn new mechanics that ties in with the themes of the game as the story unfolds. Be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbd/dbd6eb36986a699396a46f0ce3b48c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["bonelazy", "Jonah Gaynor", "Spencer Pilarski", "Snippy Nguyen", "Sam Grant"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["4/5 Dentists"], "esrb_rating": null}
