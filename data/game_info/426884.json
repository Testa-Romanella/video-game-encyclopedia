We decided to try to make a hex-tile based cult building simulator and learn how to dive deeper into engines like Unity. The idea was to start with a few cultists, begin collecting resources like wood and metal to build your own housing and temples, and sending the cultists around to recruit new members while using their \"devotion points\" to their respective god (chosen by the player) as a type of currency. We planned on implementing basic real-time strategy elements and UI's but unfortunately due to recent world events and logistical issues, our progress was stalled quite significantly and we went way past submission time. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T05:22:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a7/0a7e4533ead1b962b4a93f709924cbad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SoularBearStudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
