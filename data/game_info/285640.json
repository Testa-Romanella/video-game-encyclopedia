The player must arrange the elements properly so that, when the emitter is activated, the emitted beam reflects off mirrors to avoid obstacles and touch the crystal. If the beam misses its target, the level must be restarted. </p>\n<p>Later puzzles feature more complex elements, such as bombs that are lit by the beam and destroy obstacles in the vicinity, or barriers which rotate when the light passes through a switch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-19T18:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d43/d43d619da926bf931a9c9731b9731430.jpg", "website": "http://www.vertigogaming.net/main/freeware/2/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Vertigo Gaming"], "esrb_rating": null}
