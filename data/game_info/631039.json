This is the first game I ever upload for other people to see, as well as the submission for the first game jam I have ever done: Trijam #127. I know it isn't great by any means, but I hope you like it :D. Unfortunately I couldn't make the game in the time they gave me (3 hours), but I know it technically is optional, so that's why I submited anyways.</p>\n<p>This game is about a thieve who is trying to scaoe form the police but Reality<strong>\u2122</strong> just recently had an update. However, the update was really bad and therefore everything got super buggy, thigs were glitching, no-clipping, time is resetting over and over... What a mess.</p><p>NOTE: Sorry I didn't upload an html build. Hope I can do that next time!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:10:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a1/5a1acfd088b56f9974753f17371f6ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kaniko7"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
