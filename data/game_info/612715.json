This will be changed if we resume the development improving also de UI in general.</p>\n<p><strong><em>TIPS/INFO:</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>The UI of the game works using the mouse. You can navigate the UI by clicking on the buttons.</li><li>To play the match, you need a PS4 and/or XBOX controller. If you use a PS4 controller, you might need to map the inputs with other software like DS4Windows (for example). As a local-multiplayer game you will need 2 controllers to play, there is no single player mode by the moment.</li><li>During a match, you can open the pause menu by pressing ESC key\u00a0in the keyboard</li></ul>\n<p>Hope you like it!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T09:06:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0314f2b82947e0854ba77928ddeaea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dither Games", "Hr\u00f3\u00f0vitnir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
