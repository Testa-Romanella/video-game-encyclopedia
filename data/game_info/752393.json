A solitary munk, trying to get closer to his god.</p>\n<p>Play as a munk trying to get closer to god through isolation.</p>\n<p>The project is originally in danish, but I have done my best to translate the subtitles and menus. Please keep in mind it was made for another language, but I believe it should translate nicely through gameplay.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game is controlled using only the <strong>left </strong>and <strong>right </strong><strong>mouse </strong><strong>buttons</strong>. Use either the <strong>mouse </strong>or <strong>spacebar </strong>to interact, depending on the situation.<br/>Move around using <strong>WASD</strong></p>\r\nRequirements\r\n<p>The game is very unoptimized and requires a powerful graphics card. Please keep this in mind. If you are unable to run the game, you can watch the full playthrough on youtube.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>In The Blue hour of Dusk - By Albert Christoffersen and Jakob Bang (Bantle)</p>\n<p><strong>Albert Christoffersen and Jakob Bang<br/></strong>Concept and Idea<br/>Manuscript<br/>Environmental Design<br/>Narrative Design<br/>Voice Acting<br/><br/><strong>Jakob Bang<br/></strong>Programming<br/>Implementation<br/>UI Design<br/>Sound Design<br/>Animation<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Albert Christoffersen<br/></strong>3D modelling<br/>Texturing<br/>Visual Concepting<br/>Vocal Mixing<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Albert Christoffersen and Aske S\u00f8ltoft<br/></strong>Music, Theme and Concept<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Aske S\u00f8ltoft<br/></strong>Music Production and Arrangement<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Aske S\u00f8ltoft and Frej Darger<br/></strong>Punk Song - All I dream about you<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Martin Christoffersen<br/></strong>Woodblock Illustrations<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T06:49:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/938/938f5f4bba52b36b609d61dbcd36320b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bantle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
