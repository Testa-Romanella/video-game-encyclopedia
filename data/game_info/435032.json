The storm will be over in seven days. Your task is to chop trees and hunt deer to keep you and Emily alive.

The theme was \"Keep it alive\". In this case, you have to keep Emily alive (the woman in the cabin). I first wanted to go for some kind of monster that you had to bring to some place, but this was hard because of the freezing mechanic I wanted to implemented. Though, Emily is pretty nice as well.</p>\n<p><em>Total development time: 25 hours [jam] + 4 hours [post-jam]</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T11:36:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e64f311a617c6b8cb0a4af34e38c4631.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Mika la Grand"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
