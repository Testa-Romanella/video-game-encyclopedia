A little research on the matter could get you covered with all details you need ;) Thanks!</li><li><strong>Why are you wasting your time with non profitable projects?\u00a0</strong> As a highschool student who is totally passionate about this artistic field and thrilled to learn about game development and gain experience from as a hobby, a fangame made for fun and experimentation fully suited my time and will. The lessons learnt are countless and experience had was priceless. A perfect preparation for the serious and completely original ambitions of the future!
