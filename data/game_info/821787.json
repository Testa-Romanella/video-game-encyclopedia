This includes sound effects and UI work being basically non existent. The game is also fairly buggy.</p><p>Also, WebGL version has some issues. For example one issue is\u00a0I use some custom shaders for some tricks with a stencil buffer for poking holes in objects for the pits, and in the WebGL version these shaders don't seem to work properly despite being fully URP compatible. I recommend using the standalone version over the web version.</p>\n<p>Developed for\u00a0GMTK 2022 Game Jam, theme \"Roll of the Dice\". You roll a number of dice who's sides have types of terrain on them, and then position them in the available space to layout a custom path through the level.</p>\n<p>Water tiles will make you wet for a while. Walking onto ice while wet will freeze you for a time (but also cancels the sliding effect of ice). Normally Ice will make you slide until you hit a wall or the edge of the playable area, getting frozen can be a way to avoid this and can get you out of tricky situations.<br/></p>\n<p>Walking onto sand tiles while wet will give you a status effect of \"Covered\", which is currently unused, wasn't implemented due to time constraints (original aim was to have it reduce your movement speed and damage).</p>\n<p>Move into a tile occupied by an enemy to damage them, avoid them damaging you. (Yes there are no animations for the character/enemy, when I said I needed to cut things out I meant a lot)</p>\n<p>Again apologies for how half-baked everything is, but I still wanted to get it out as I did spend 38+ hours on this.</p>\n<p><strong>Control Info:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Escape</strong>: Exit game when in dice roll mode, exit gameplay mode.</li><li><strong>R</strong>: Respawn.
