Play around with the weapons <br/>\u00a0and find starts. <br/></p>\n\n<p>The white weapon means you have to bash into enemies yourself (you become the bullet!). Felt like I had to explain that cause I didn't get time to put proper instructions or a guide for that lol. The others are pretty self-explanatory.</p>\n\n<p>This was made for the bullet hell jam and was a very fun game to make. Would have been better if I didn't procrastinate half the week but what can you do lol</p>\n<p>The Windows version is most recommended as it has the highscores intact and is the version I have tested the most. I have not (yet) tested the Linux build so there could be a lot of bugs with that or it might not work at all.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:26:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d21/d2144413dcaedcd5d6be406415f86b7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Lemin"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
