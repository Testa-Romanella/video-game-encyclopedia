He had a nice job, had a nice house, and had a goldfish, named Ted. One day, aliens struck from another world! The great worm drained the world from all of its water, and Ted was captured. Set in the Mojave, several bounties have been placed against the great worm. Several factions have gathered to destroy the worm, and claim their prize. John D. Pedal is a lone wolf in this world, and only cares about finding his goldfish, Ted. <br/><br/><strong>Driving and Shooting</strong><br/><br/>Dead Pedal is all about driving and shooting.
