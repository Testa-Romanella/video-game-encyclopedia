Play\r\nas either the Heroic Goku or evil Majin Buu and fight in an all new Dragon Ball\r\nZ environment above the clouds among destructible rocks that crumble under the\r\npower of your ferocious attacks. Players wield all the best\r\npowers from the original anime such as Goku's Kamehameha wave or the ability to\r\npower up to Super Saiyan or Super Buu. Dragon Ball Z Ultimate\r\nWarrior is a lightning fast but strategic game that requires the use of every\r\nattack at the player\u2019s disposal. The game currently only features\r\ntwo playable characters but new characters and maps will be added in\r\nfuture. My name is Luke and this is my first attempt at making a\r\ngame. Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Warrior was a school assignment\r\nin which we had to develop our own game using the program Game Maker. I\r\nchoose to do a two player fighting game as I thought it would be simple just to\r\nhave two characters fight with no A.I required but the game turned out to be\r\nquite difficult to make and was a lot of work so I hope you enjoy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4ba277c42ed9c650f7aea9a66c29764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xXNZHUSLAXx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
