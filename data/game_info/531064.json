It is said flowers would bloom in her step and she was renowned for her beauty. Hades, lord of the Underworld, coveted her for himself. Hades<strong>\u00a0</strong>kidnapped Persephone and brought her to the Underworld where he forced her to be his Queen. Though she was eventually rescued, she had already eaten from the fruit of the Underworld-6 Pomegranate seeds. Due to this, Persephone was doomed to return and rule the Underworld for 6 months each year. When she is in the Underworld, plants wither and die. When she is free, they bloom and prosper. This is the origin myth of the seasons. <br/></p>\n<p>This is the most famous myth of Persephone- the only one in which she takes center stage- and yet she is relegated to the role of victim. She is kidnapped and she is rescued, but she never has a voice. This was the inspiration for our game <em>Persephone.</em></p>\n<p><em>Persephone</em> is a short Bitsy game in which the player must explore and solve puzzles, as Persephone, in order to escape the Underworld. Created by Ailea Merriam-Pigg, Brianna Luettgen, Diana Pe\u00f1a-Morena, Hannah Beers, and Mikey Tarczynski this Bitsy game is a small-scale proof of concept for a larger game, coming to you in the future. Enjoy meeting characters from Greek mythology and history, from Hercules to Hecate, Sappho to Socrates. Just remember to avoid those pesky pomegranate seeds!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T04:39:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be47e312cbcad05932a1c857be94cf71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["greeneyedtrombonist"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
