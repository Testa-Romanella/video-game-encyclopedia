You collect points by combining cards together to make runs, triple, fifteen, pairs and having a Jack of the same suit as the starter card (\"one for his nob or nobs or nibs\"). The mathematics is simple, but cribbage is a game of strategy and tactics. Sometimes you try to score points, sometimes you try to stop your opponent from scoring; every game is subtly different.<br/><br/>Cribbage relies on experience and intuition rather than strict mathematical calculation.<br/><br/>As all card games, cribbage trains memory, concentration, and strategic thinking skills.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to be the first to score 121 points acquired over several deals. Points are scored mainly for combinations of cards either occurring during the play or occurring in a player's hand or in the cards discarded before the play, which form the crib.<br/><br/>Cribbage is a card game that is played with a deck of 52 standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the Cribbage Board. <br/><br/>Each player is dealt with 6 cards. After looking over the hand, each player lays away two cards face-down. The four cards laid away, placed in one pile, form the crib. The crib, counts for the dealer. <br/>The non-dealer therefore tries to lay away cards that are least likely to create a score in the crib for the dealer. <br/><br/>To begin play (called pegging), the dealer turns up the top card of the stock. This card is called one for the starter. If this card is a jack, the dealer immediately pegs two, traditionally called two for his heels. In cribbage, points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, pairs, triples, quadruples, runs and flushes.<br/><br/>If one player reaches the target point 121 the game ends immediately and that player wins. <br/><br/>The interweaving of luck and skill in cribbage is interesting.<br/><br/>Challenge yourself against our expert AI.
