The first thing we need is your support in programming the movement of our new no-contact delivery pod. Because this is the cheapest delivery pod yet, you will not have access to any sensor data and movement curves are limited to sine waves. Just make sure the package doesn't fall out of the pod and everyone will be happy. It will probably only take you about 5 minutes. Good luck!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>R: Reset attempt<br/>Escape / Space: Pause</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T05:58:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/615/6156e906312563e362de7ba5c7ba61ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["irwatts"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
