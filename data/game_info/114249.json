She might not realize it at first, but it's inevitable. This is a short story that establishes how exactly this happened... admittedly, it's a bit abridged, but she did make this in two weeks. Give her a break.</p>\n<p><strong>THROUGH THE SCREEN</strong> is a short (~30 minutes) visual novel about a dorky girl who writes fanfiction who falls for a dorky guy who also writes fanfiction.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is one ending.
