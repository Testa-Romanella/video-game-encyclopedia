I want to present my most recent fan project SuperMarioWars64! Is a Nintendo universe based strategy game or how I like to call it L.S.G Light Strategy Game (because it\u2019s really simple gameplay, not even close to something like Age of Empires or Starcraft. I have another take on this).\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a project I have been working for a while and I wanted to showcase you what I have until now.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the trailer there will be things like:</p>\n<p>-Decide the faction of your team</p>\n<p>-Preset the buildings of your base</p>\n<p>-Decide which towers you want</p>\n<p>-Arrange the equipments and the gear of units<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>The game is still in a reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally early stage of development and I have many more improvements on the way (like more factions, item, weapons, mechanics, etc) but at least right now I feel comfortable enough to show something.</p>\n<p>////--////</p>\n<p>A note before saying anything else:</p>\n<p>The lack of support will never prevent me from releasing the game for you to enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p>BUT</p>\n<p>If you think you can trust this crazy stranger enough to start just helping me right now in any way\u2026 you can just choose to donate on my patreon, but just playing the game would be enough to make me happy!! :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T05:11:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be35a8ee935529ad138f9ef1bf97206e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G64"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
