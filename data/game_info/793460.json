As the winds and waves rage, can you repair the damage to the boat successfully and avoid disaster? The player will be launched into the frantic fast-paced scene at sea and quickly complete minigames to keep the boat afloat.\u00a0\r\n<p>Bosun has been developed as a 2D single player atmospheric experience where you prevent your ship from sinking in a raging storm. I went into this project hoping to get across the experience of being panicked and lost at sea to players. The mechanics aim to evoke the feelings of the protagonist as they struggle against the unforgiving forces of nature.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T20:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c94/c94030e905a0c9b67e7dc35d6f37e26b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skobz"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
