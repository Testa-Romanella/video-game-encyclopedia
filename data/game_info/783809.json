When greatness is thrust upon our new hero, he must rise to the occasion, but he won\u2019t be without help. In this turn-based rogue-like dungeon crawler, you begin your journey by prepping in Bizarro Earth\u2014which is a lot like regular Earth, but with more dungeons and monsters. Using this new realm as your training ground, you gather strength and friends to help you along your way.<br />\nArm yourself with various types of equipment to change your appearance and abilities, and use the grid-based Body Modification system to boost your attributes and gain beneficial effects. Between missions, you can plan your next move within your home base. Access various dungeons, interact with your allies, and sell or store the spoils from your adventures. You can also customize your home base with facilities and assign your allies to them in order to grant unique advantages to you while you\u2019re in dungeons. Dungeons are randomly generated and multi-leveled, so be ready to adapt and fight! Boss battles await you at the end of certain dungeons, so learn their unique mechanics and gimmicks in order to triumph against them. Completing dungeons earns you items while also increasing your Total Level count, which improves your base attributes and gets you ever closer to defeating Darkdeath Evilman and saving the world!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-15T07:43:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf2d3e7027544977c5860b47acd87bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Codeglue", "Nippon Ichi Software"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["NIS America"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
