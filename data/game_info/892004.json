With each Heart Fragment you found and return to the Forest God, will bring you closer to saving the Forest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Double Jump </strong>- The players have the ability to use a double jump for enhanced manoeuvrability.\u00a0This jump can be held to increase its height.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glow </strong>- The players are able to press the shift button to glow. When the players use this ability,\u00a0they are surrounded by a glowing blue light. When this light interacts with the dark/light sensitive\u00a0mushrooms they will either shrink or grow. The ability can only be used for a limited time and is\u00a0indicated by a blue bar on the bottom left. Once the bar runs out, the player can no longer use\u00a0the ability until it recharges over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Glide</strong> - When a player uses the jump button in an air draft it gives them the ability to glide. While\u00a0gliding, the player follows the air drafts direction until it runs out, in which case the player simply\u00a0falls.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Designers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Bilal Jalil -\u00a0Sounds &amp; Audio designer<strong>\ud80c\udefc\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Brodie Maddren -\u00a0Level &amp; Enemy designer<strong>\ud80c\udefc\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Charlie Brazil -\u00a0Co-Lead, Level, Environment and UX Designer<strong>\ud80c\udefc\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Paige Dowsett -\u00a0Co-Lead, GUI, Level and Environmental Designer<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Zachariach Navarro-Bustos -\u00a0Player &amp; Environment designer<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Artists:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Azshwyn Sibley -\u00a03D environment &amp; texturing artist<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Hayley Brooker -\u00a03D characters &amp; Lead artist<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Holly Thompson -\u00a03D models &amp; 2D Environment artist<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Jesse Lazzaro -\u00a0GUI, VFX &amp; animations artist<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Programmers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Jazmin Fazzolari -\u00a0GUI, Environment programmer &amp; Project Coordinator<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Lewis Comstive -\u00a0Player controls &amp; abilities programmer<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Nghia Do -\u00a0Audio,\u00a0 misc &amp; Programming Lead<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Nicholas Connell -\u00a0Artificial Intelligence &amp; enemy abilities programmer<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Issac Philips<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Jack Ashurst<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Olivia Buyteweg<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>\n<p><strong>\ud80c\udf4a\ud80c\udefc</strong>Yomi Adeyeni<strong>\ud80c\udefc</strong><strong>\ud80c\udf4a</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T08:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca0/ca09e42528f00802dff158159a4652b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HOTF: Designers Edit"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
