Like explosions, guns, and stuff?\u00a0</p>\n<p>You came to the wrong place. This is a stupid game. Go get Gmod or something.</p>\n<p>Fine. You can play this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mess around with building, islands, explosions, guns, and even nukes! Paint stuff, drive cars, build houses, nuke places, crash cars, and especially BLOW STUFF UP! With a plethora of things at your disposal, including a spawner/gravity gun, a property gun which allows you to edit mass, size, and bomb countdowns, and a spray tool to paint stuff, your afternoon can easily be squandered away with this silly little sandbox.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: WASD+SPACE to move+jump, L+R arrow keys to switch weapons, TAB on any of the creative tools to open their menu, ESC for pause menu.</p>\n<p>J+K to rotate stuff you picked up</p>\n<p>X to delete stuff (when holding GravityGun)</p>\n<p>E to pickup stuff (if you have fists/gravitygun equipped)</p>\n<p>Z to spawn a thing after you select it</p>\n<p>Q to interact with some stuff (makes bombs count down too)</p>\n<p>G to enter vehicle</p>\n\n<p>An unfinished project I released for some reason.
