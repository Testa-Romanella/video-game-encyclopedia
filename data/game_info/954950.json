Still, I think you\u2019ll have fun even if you don\u2019t know the band\u2019s music\u2026 Maybe, haha. :p</p>\n<p>For context, this year, I\u2019m focusing on my mental health and therapy. Fall Out Boy\u2019s discography has been the soundtrack to these weird, sad, joyful days.\u00a0 I\u2019m super grateful for their songs &amp; I made this small game to say thanks.</p>\n<p>The band's music has ALWAYS resonated with me during the weirdest, hardest times. That\u2019s as true in 2023 as it was in 2015 or 2005. Obviously, I love the new album. It\u2019s a real accomplishment that the music feels SO PERSONAL to me &amp; I\u2019m SO happy it exists!</p>\n<p>Lastly, I should mention I do not intend to profit from this game. I just love making games &amp; art &amp; I wanted to make something special for myself and the fandom... and maybe... the band? I dunno lol.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! &lt;3</p>\n<p>Jamie Ashlynn Barker (she/they)</p>\n<p>fakegamercomics@gmail.com &lt;-- email me</p>\n<p>NOTE: The game is not available on mobile currently.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T17:54:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c4/5c4fd0f74ec9bb1821805fba9aafba4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fake gamer comics", "ashlander games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
