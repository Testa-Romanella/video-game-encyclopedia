Now among the ruins and among the titans a lone hero armed with only one arrow gathers again the souls of the Titans in search of strength.</p>\n<p>Titan Souls is a 2D game in the open world with a top-down camera. The player has only one arrow and can only withstand one hit from the enemies. The main task is to defeat 19 giant monsters called Titans, who can also endure only one hit. There is only one way to beat each titan and only difficulty increases: the fact that the player needs to retrieve the only arrow after every unsuccessful attempt</p>\n<p>The developers were inspired by Dark Souls the series Shadow of the Colossus and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, taking incredible complexity, atmosphere and puzzles from them. The game was meant for replaying for truly devoted fans to achieve faster times and fewer deaths.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2015-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:51:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fc/2fc6994425146f9dba3133400b414e29.jpg", "website": "http://www.acidnerve.com", "rating": 3.34, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 321, "owned": 4587, "beaten": 163, "toplay": 56, "dropped": 288, "playing": 27}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 108, "ratings_count": 514, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 517, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PS Vita", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Devolver Digital", "Acid Nerve"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
