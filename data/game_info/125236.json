Go on an adventure with your friend to find out if you can really make something of yourself without your family's help.</p>\n<p><em>This game is a passion project of my husband and I for the IGMC 2017. We present to you what is the beginning of something that my husband has wanted to do for a long time. We will continue to work on this after the contest because we were happy to. Now\u00a0 we will\u00a0 have better opportunities to work on this and won't have to worry about the time crunch between jobs and fussy toddlers. Please enjoy, from our family to yours.</em></p>\n<p><em>-</em>The Deatz.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/116f2175af4ba4698dd7bcf5eb86c778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aliisza"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
