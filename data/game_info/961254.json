{"id": 961254, "slug": "dawn-vs-dusk", "name": "Dawn vs Dusk", "name_original": "Dawn vs Dusk", "description": "(5/22/23 - First released version has some glaring bugs! I'm sorry but some sound effects are not being heard on all clients, and some bugs with point capture are present)<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDawn vs Dusk is a 3v3, PvPvE, asymmetric, hard-point capture, styled, brawler.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFeaturing Unreal Engine 5 and Paragon assets, this game is a re-imagining of what that franchise could have been. There are no lanes, there are no towers to destroy; only three capture pads. <br/>\r\nWhen a team captures a pad they get Gold points to spend on card upgrades. Cards change the game by giving health, mana, or damage boosts. Each player receives 5 lives with no respawn timer, so play smart! Last team standing wins!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs of today, May 22, 2023 the game is still a baby. Please be patient as I work solo to build and update this game. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEarly access, pre-alpha gameplay is not representative of the finished product, but comments and constructive criticism are welcome.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-26T03:06:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e5/2e52ef5887b50d74f12f36c574b24e51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arthur Spears"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Self"], "esrb_rating": null}
