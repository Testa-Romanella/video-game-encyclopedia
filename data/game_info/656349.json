A very, very, exclusive one: the King invited only the richest nobles and made up a great feast! And you are even invited, but you're not a nobleman\u00a0or a noble lady...you are a very special guest. A Jester arrived from far away to give the king the entertainment he wants. However, he could have just got the wrong one. I wonder what great chaos are you up to bring at the King's Feast.\"</em></p><p>This is my first published game realized for my first GameJam (Brackeys 2021.2) and it so happens to be a messy game too. I had a ton of fun doing it so it's still valuable to me. Hope you'll find it good too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:14:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/329613299d56da0e387df9f6da825af8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Daud199"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
