You know... before.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Fools &amp; Heartbreaks\u00a0</strong>is a supplement for TorTheVic's Vampires and Claymores, an absolutely excellent game in its own right.

It focuses on digging into and pulling details from your vampire's past to see how they deal with the present.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Fools &amp; Heartbreaks</strong> is not a standalone game;\u00a0it requires Vampires &amp; Claymores to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-09T02:18:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee31a765ddc03ea05413399f59383af9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Umbra"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
