Before finalizing the transaction, you decide to personally inspect the property. However, instead of a straightforward and quick interaction with the client, you find yourself thrust into a deeply unsettling and frightening situation.<br/><br/>This game requires the use of a microphone for certain parts of the gameplay. With your microphone, you can speak and hear your voice in real-time within the game, with effects that vary depending on your in-game location.<br/><br/>For instance, when you're inside a building, your voice will echo. However, when you're out in the open field, your voice will sound normal.<br/><br/><strong>Key Feature</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>Immersive gameplay<br/></li><li>Immersive flashlight<br/></li><li>Hyper-realistic graphics<br/></li><li>Real-time voice recognition<br/></li><li> Surrounding-based voice recognition<br/></li><li>Rich Storyline<br/></li><li>Fear Inducing Atmosphere</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-15T07:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2f/c2fdea55044e2bc725b337860dd9589b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["ZPLAY Games", "ZPLAY", "SolitaryStudios"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Zplay (Beijing) Info.
