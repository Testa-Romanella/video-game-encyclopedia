One other bug is that a level will repeat, reload if that happens. Something I didn't have time to fix, is that the third level wasn't working in the Unity Editor, but is showing up now, so DON'T walk off there or you will have to reload, but\u00a0your level will save if you reload.</p>\n<p>You are a postman, and you have to deliver your letter to the right person (green). But be sure not to give it to the wrong person(red), or you will be fired and have to restart the level.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam, so it is going to be bad. I ran out of time and couldn't add more levels or a level select screen, but I think it's good for a first Jam!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T03:20:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff2ae26dd08034b6b43b01efaf373bab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["B0_studios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
