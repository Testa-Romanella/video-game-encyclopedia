It's all about knocking them down not just once, but\u00a0<strong>again and again.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>No long movelists to memorize or complicated inputs to practice. There's just 3 attacks: <strong>punch</strong>, <strong>kick</strong>, and <strong>counter</strong>. Each attack knocks your opponent down to the ground. From there, they can either\u00a0<strong>get up</strong>, <strong>roll left</strong>, or <strong>roll right</strong> -- so try to get a follow-up hit!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong><em>Xbox or PlayStation controllers are recommended.</em></p>\r\nXboxPlayStationP1 KeyboardP2 KeyboardMove<br/>D-Pad<br/>D-Pad<br/>WASD<br/>Arrow Keys<br/>PunchXSquareC,KickACrossV.CounterBCircleB/\r\n\n<p><strong>NEUTRAL OPTIONS</strong><br/>When standing, you can punch, counter, or kick.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>GROUNDED OPTIONS</strong>When grounded, you can input left, right, or up.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TECHING</strong><br/>Teching is faster than the normal grounded\u00a0options.\u00a0You can tech by pressing the input at the right timing (just as you're about to land on the ground).\u00a0You can tech up, techroll left, or techroll right.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEALTH RECOVER<br/></strong>If you can return to a neutral standing position from being grounded, you can recover up to 1 health. If you land an\u00a0attack, it's important to land a follow-up attack also!</p>\n\n<p><strong>PERFECT</strong><br/>It's still possible to perfect your opponent after recovering health!</p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Brian S.
