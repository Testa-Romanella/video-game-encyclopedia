{"id": 767551, "slug": "pups-and-pawjudice", "name": "Pups and Pawjudice", "name_original": "Pups and Pawjudice", "description": "<p>Thank you for checking out <em>Pups and Pawjudice</em>!</p>\n<p>Made as a final project for my Narrative and Technology class in fall 2020,\u00a0<em>Pups and Pawjudice</em> exists to unite the worlds of classic literature and video games (and dogs).</p>\n<p>Play as Lizzy Boofet, the second oldest of five sisters, as she navigates through a relatively modern adaptation of Jane Austen's\u00a0<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. Interact with other characters along the way, including Charles Barkley and his sisters, Charlotte Woofas, and of course, the doggishly handsome yet taciturn Mr. Dogcy.</p>\n<p>The only image I own in the game is of Mr. Dogcy. All other images were found through the American Kennel Club site or through Google Image search. The music is borrowed from the 2005 film adaptation. The script is adapted into my own cursed vernacular. The game was created using Ren'Py.</p>\n<p>QA</p>\n<p>Why dogs?</p>\n<p>I like dogs.\u00a0I thought it would be funny. I still think it is.</p>\n<p>Is the game done?</p>\n<p>Yes and no. Yes, in that you can (probably) make it through the story with no issue. No, in that there are a few typos in the script that may result in a game crash.\u00a0Woops.</p>\n<p>Will there be more games like\u00a0<em>Pups and Pawjudice</em>?</p>\n<p>While not centered around dogs (or sadly any animal for that matter), I\u00a0<em>am</em> developing a visual novel adaptation of Thomas Hardy's\u00a0<em>The Return of the Native</em>. There is untapped potential with classic literature and visual novels, I\u00a0can feel it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T00:55:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62c/62c2cebb4ffc58be0a583202f83e7ce4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kylie Dougherty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
