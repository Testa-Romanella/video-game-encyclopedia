{"id": 693289, "slug": "bimblors-adventure", "name": "Bimblor's Adventure", "name_original": "Bimblor's Adventure", "description": "<p>This is a very early development build of a game called \"Bimblor's Adventure\". Development is on hold until further notice. The basic concept is a side scroller adventure game with elements of combat. The main character is a wizard and most of the enemies are to be frog themed. In this early build the basics of the gameplay and spritework can be seen through a testing level that is playable. There is an enemy that can be defeated (the player can be defeated by this enemy as well) which shows our basic ideas for combat elements, spritework, and animations. Other basic platformer elements are also implemented in this test scene. Programing and implementation has been done by Phillips Albright, and spritework and animation by Chloe Roberts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:31:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c1/9c12a84330b471996ae8015478a00d2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["phillips-albright"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
