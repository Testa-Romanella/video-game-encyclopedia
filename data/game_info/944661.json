Who could have ever predicted that winning a Tandy TRS80 in a coloring contest from Radioshack back in the 80's would lead to this? I made this game primarily to learn the programming language C# and the Unity engine but after receiving positive feedback from others, decided to make it something to share. Along with the audio finesesses of SpongeCC, we hope you enjoy this taste of kitty goodness and will help us make the full game a reality!</p>\n<p>~Want the handcrafted catbutt drink coasters featured in the video?<br/>~Want to see <em>your</em> floofy friend in the game? <br/>\r\nPlease check out our CatStarter... er...
