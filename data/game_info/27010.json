OK, maybe mind<br />\nblowing is going a little far, but you catch our drift. You play the<br />\ngame on the bottom screen and the top screen always displays a close-up<br />\nview of Joe and his actions. It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re directing the<br />\nmovie on the bottom and others can watch the top screen as a movie over<br />\nyour shoulder. Charge them admission.</p>\n<p>This version of the Viewtiful one features several VFX powers including<br />\nseveral that are touch screen specific. You don&#39;t need to use your<br />\nstylus, in fact, your finger is recommended. One of the new powers is<br />\ncalled &quot;scratch&quot; and you do exactly that, you make a scratching motion<br />\non the screen. The scratch technique brings props and production<br />\nequipment falling from the sky and onto your enemies. There&#39;s also<br />\n&quot;split&quot; which is a puzzle mechanism that lets you slow down time, draw a<br />\nline on the screen and then rearrange objects on the top part of that<br />\nsplit. Maybe you move a safe from a shelf to over your enemy&#39;s head.<br />\nThat&#39;s a headache when it comes crashing down.</p>\n<p>The big payoff comes via the &quot;Joe Camera.&quot; This move lets you pull down<br />\nthe upper screen (the one that&#39;s giving you close-ups of your action on<br />\nthe bottom screen) to literally give Joe a helping hand. You may need to<br />\nflip a switch to open a door, but you need a close up of the switch to<br />\naccess it. Once you pull the screen down, you can use your finger (or<br />\nstylus of course) to flip the switch.</p>\n<p>Bottom Line</p>\n<p>Viewtiful Joe is turning into a great action-platformer franchise and<br />\nthe DS version looks almost as good as the GameCube titles. That&#39;s quite<br />\nan accomplishment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T19:33:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13d/13dae045ead16ebff4a2f9f3509236e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 331, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
