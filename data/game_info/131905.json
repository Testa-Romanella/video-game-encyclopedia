Written in Pascal, which was my first programming language. It's here only because I found the original 16-bit executable and it turned out I was already pretty FLOSS-oriented, cause I happened to attach source code to everything. At least, source code of a unit (Pascal name for library or module), not of the main program. Still, the main program was pretty easy to reconstruct.</p><p>\r\n\tThis is only here to prove that I don't know Pascal and that I can make games.</p><p>\r\n\tThe source code is available on my Github. If you look carefully enough, you can see I had implemented a simple cheat code back then.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michcioperz"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
