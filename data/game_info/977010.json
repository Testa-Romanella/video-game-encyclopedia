{"id": 977010, "slug": "warsphere", "name": "WarSphere", "name_original": "WarSphere", "description": "You take the role of an NC3 AI-Chip that emulates the neural correlates of consciousness, an artificial brain, operating a highly effective Armed Spherical Robotic System, aka a WarSphere. An entity called 'Mother' overrides your purpose and sends you on a journey of destruction, the meaning of which will only unravel at your final destination. <br/><br/><br/><br/>WarSphere is a game for those who like challenging, skill-based games, that are unforgiving, but rewarding. Death in WarSphere is permanent, which gives you an adrenaline-charged, high-stakes experience. Every run and every world is randomly generated, giving WarSphere a high level of replayability.<br/><br/><h3>ENDGAME</h3>Unlike other roguelikes, in WarSphere you get to keep a copy of the final setup and loadout with which you successfully beat a run. This storage is called \"The Archive\". Depending on the difficulty you played, you will be able to unlock and experience different end game activities, which include: 4 realms, with 4 tiers each, ranked arcade mode, daily time trials with leaderboards and community maps.<br/><br/><h3>EXPERIENCE</h3><ul><li>the most presumptuous camera perspective since the existence of video games <br/></li><li>the adrenaline from nearly dying in higher levels<br/></li><li>the frustration of actually dying in higher levels<br/></li><li>the reward of completing a run successfully<br/></li><li>the pride in your unlocked Archive Entries<br/></li><li>the joy of beating endgame realms and community maps with your Archive Entries<br/></li><li>the affordable humor of random adjective/name combinations</li></ul><br/><h3>KEY FEATURES</h3><ul><li>4 BILLION seeded runs!<br/></li><li>5 Worlds, with several Dungeons each (2 in free base game + 3 in DLC)<br/></li><li>60+ Enemy Types (25 in free base game + 35 in DLC)<br/></li><li>Randomized Elite and Minion enemies<br/></li><li>32 Elite Modifiers<br/></li><li>10 Primary Weapon Types<br/></li><li>10 Secondary Weapon Types<br/></li><li>12 ACM Types (Special Abilities)<br/></li><li>6 Upgrades<br/></li><li>Tons of item modifications<br/></li><li>15 Character Multipliers, that are upgraded with items and chips<br/></li><li>Map Editor<br/></li><li>Extensive enemy modding, integrated in the Map Editor</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T14:54:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/6411445cb1b61dd5acf629108fb1bafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Last Tuesday Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Last Tuesday Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
