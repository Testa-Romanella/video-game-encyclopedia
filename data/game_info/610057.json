The urge to possess something can force people into doing terrible things. But the end justifies the means and nobody can stop you from achieving your goal: the Brainbug.\r\n </p>\n<p>A playthrough of this short point and click game should take you about 15 minutes and offers a weird little story and a few small puzzles.\r\n </p>\n<p>This is the first game I made on my own and it was mainly meant to help me get into game development. But I liked the outcome and therefor I decided to release it. If you enjoy it, there's more to come! <br/><br/>Links:<br/>\u2022\u00a0Website<br/>\r\n\u2022\u00a0Twitter<br/>\u2022\u00a0YouTube\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T10:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ef/0ef8ffe7ccb56985c63d057288613ef2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DevonWolters"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
