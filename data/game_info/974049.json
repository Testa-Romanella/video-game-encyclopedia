You live in a city built above the clouds of radioactive dust, devoid of a sense of purpose, participating in yet another \"Groundhog Day\" of the main character. Your task is to descend beneath the surface of the city to repair the autonomous system that ensures the functioning of the city's inhabitants. Is it just another routine malfunction, or will today be the day that changes you forever? It's time to answer the question of what your path and truth are.<br/><br/>Hand-drawn graphics<br/>One of the unique features of our game is hand-drawn graphics. In the age of artificial intelligence, games created from AI-generated assets and photos, we have prepared hand-drawn graphics, scenes, and animations that create a unique atmosphere in Lazarus.

It's not obvious at first glance, so if you're looking for something more in games, you will find a hidden message and a parallel story here.

That's one of the magical elements of Lazarus.<br/><br/>Achievements<br/>Achievement Hunter, we have prepared Achievements that will enrich your collection. Of course, not all of them will be easy to obtain. In the end, you will be able to compare yourself in this regard against other players in \"Lazarus a.d. 2222\".
