Unfortunately, when an alien is destroyed, another one will\r\ntake its place, and even though the end it inevitable, humans will not go down\r\nwithout a fight.  It is truly Earth's last stand, but let it be a noble one!\r\nWhen the game is started, aliens will appear near the top of the screen and\r\nstart to descend.\r\nKeyboard controls are Z and X keys for left/right and / key to fire your\r\nmissile.  When a missile is fired, you cannot fire another one until that\r\nmissile has either hit an alien or reached the top of the screen.\r\nAn alien is hit, your score is increased by an amount dependend on how close\r\nthe alien is to the bottom. A new alien will regenerate, but not as high up\r\nas at the beginning of the game, and typically all aliens will start to descend\r\nmore regularly.  This is how the difficulty of the game progresses, and it gets\r\nhard quite quickly!\r\nThe game does not end until an alien reaches the same level as your ship, so\r\nkeep going and try tactics like hitting the lowest aliens first and moving as\r\nsoon as possible to get to the next alien you want to target.\r\nMy best score is 665, which I did by initially waiting to hit aliens when they\r\nwere in the yellow zone so as to get more points. As the difficulty increases\r\nquite quickly, it's then a case of just trying to get as many as possible and\r\ndefinitely do not miss in the later stages because the aliens continue to\r\ndescend while you are waiting for the next missle to be ready!\r\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRecommend to use an Oric-1 emulator, I have used Oricutron 1.2 which runs fine\r\non Windows 10.\r\n1. Download the zip file from here:\r\nhttp://www.emucamp.com/oric/oricutron/windows/Oricutron_win32_v12.zip\r\n2. Extract to a folder called Oric or similar\r\n3. Copy the file INVADERS.TAP to the Oric\\tapes folder\r\n4. Start the emulator oricutron.exe (will start in Atmos mode by default)\r\n5. Type CLOAD\"INVADERS.TAP\" and press enter\r\n6. Game will load almost instantly\r\n7. LIST to show the program\r\n8. Type RUN to play the game\r\n9. Keyboard controls: 'Z'=Left, 'X'=Right, '/'=Fire\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION\r\nOric BASIC only allows less than 80 characters per line hence PUR-80 category.\r\nThis uses the standard text mode of the Oric, which is 40 columns by 28 rows\r\n(the very top row is for system use - so 27 user accessible rows).\r\nThe background colour is set to green, yellow, red depending on the row, and\r\nthe foreground colour is set to blue, with these exceptions:\r\n- Row 0 : Background colour is black\r\n- Row 1 : Foreground colour is green (same as background colour!)\r\n- Row 26: Background colour is black\r\nRow 1 has a special purpose; when the missile is not active, it is still\r\nplotted but at row 1. However it cannot be seen because it is the same colour\r\nas the background! This saves having to make code provision to not process\r\nthe missile movement.\r\nSingle letter variables are used in place of constants as they are a little\r\nfaster to process and take up less code space. A big challenge is avoiding the\r\nuse of IF..THEN, so a lot of Boolean logic is utilised (although still had to\r\nuse it once).\r\nHow does Boolen logic help? A Boolean expression evaluates to -1 for True and\r\n0 for False. These values can be directly used in expressions to update the\r\npositions of player, alien and missle without the usual use of IF to check for\r\nboundary conditions. Another interesting way is that the value is used to\r\ndetermine whether to jump to a subroutine in line 6 to process an alien being\r\nhit. By inverting so that 1=True, the ON..GOSUB command can be use to only go\r\nto a subroutine if an expression is true and hence avoid IF..THEN!\r\nThere was enough space to squeeze in user defined graphics.  There are three\r\ncharacters re-defined to represent the player's ship, aliens and the missle.\r\nThe characters are designed using a 6x8 matrix, which is narrower than the\r\nusual 8x8 found on computers like C64 or Atari.\r\nGood sound effects are possible in such a short program due to Oric BASIC\r\nincluding single keywords called ZAP, SHOOT and EXPLODE - which do what you\r\nwould expect!\r\nPROGRAM LISTING\r\n0 U=520:W=34:X=20:Y=25:P=X:DIMJ(40):M=123:B=32:A=125:Z=124:O=24:GOSUB7:REPEAT\r\n1 K=PEEK(U):PLOTX,Y,B:X=X+(K=170ANDX&gt;2):X=X-(K=176ANDX&lt;37):PLOTX,Y,M:PLOTP,Q,B\r\n2 F=-(K=159ANDQ&lt;2):G=-(F=0):P=P*G+X*F:Q=(Q+(Q&gt;1))*G+(Y-1)*F:V=RND(1)-.3&lt;(L/20)\r\n3 H=-(Q&gt;1ANDSCRN(P,Q)=A):PLOTP,Q,Z:ONHGOSUB6:IFFTHENPLOT1,O,7:ZAP:PLOT1,O,4\r\n4 L=L+H:I=-(I&lt;w)*(i+4)-4*(i&gt;=W):J=J(I):PLOTI,J,B:J=(J-V)*-(J&lt;y)-2*(j&lt;2):j(i)=j 5=\"\" h=\"-(Q\"&gt;1ANDSCRN(I,J)=Z):PLOTI,J,A:ONHGOSUB6:L=L+H:UNTILJ=Y:EXPLODE:END\r\n6 SHOOT:PLOTP,Q,42:S=S+Q:PLOT18,0,STR$(S):J(P)=1+L/2:WAIT7:PLOTP,Q,B:Q=1:RETURN\r\n7 INK4:CLS:POKE#26A,10:FORG=0TO26:F=2*-(G&gt;0ANDG&lt;9)-(G&gt;8ANDG&lt;18)*3-(G&gt;17ANDG&lt;=Y)\r\n8 PLOT0,G,F+16:NEXT:FORG=47064TO47087:READD:POKEG,D:NEXT:PLOT1,1,2:PLOT1,0,7\r\n9 Q=1:RETURN:DATA0,12,12,45,45,63,63,30,0,8,4,8,4,8,4,0,33,18,30,45,45,63,18,33&lt;/y)-2*(j&lt;2):j(i)=j&gt;&lt;/w)*(i+4)-4*(i&gt;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44be7fdb0341964a68cd0a6e9c466b8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
