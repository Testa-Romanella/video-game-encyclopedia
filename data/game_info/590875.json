Made using the Unity FPS micro game template. Warning quite difficult.<br/></p>\n<p>Level Hints: Level 1/Nothing to it, if your health gets low let the healer do its job. - Level 2/Harder level,\u00a0 let the helicopter finish shooting and it will improve. - Level 3/Short level, shoot the dish if you get pinned. - Level 4/Large level, rush inside quick but clear the interior slowly (if it runs slow enable invincibility and kill the UFO, improves FPS). - Level 5/Move quick, grab the light and take out take sniper as quick as you can; there is also a hidden weapon that makes this level easier. - Level 6/Start badly equipped, see if you can get the shield on the left side, this will make it easy to get a good weapon in the other rooms. - Arena/Do not die because you will have to restart, take it slow but beware because later waves they will attack your starting room immediately.<br/></p>\n<p>There's a minor glitch if you restart a level that the game freezes, just pause and pause to fix.
