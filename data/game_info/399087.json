This is my very first game I have made, so I would really appreciate it if you tried my game and gave me some pointers in the comments. (:</p>\n<p>This is a game where you play as a ball who has to get to the top of the map to beat the game. The game is designed to be hard and to make you\u00a0<strong>RAGE.</strong> So please don't be mad at me, be mad at the game. I recommend you play the game with music to make the game more casual.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-16T04:24:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ec/2ec46bbf6af73e022ecc0953a625a222.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZachCreates"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
