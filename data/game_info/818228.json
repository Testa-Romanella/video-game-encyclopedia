Or else the chef won't be happy.<br/><br/>This is our submission for the GMTK2022 Game Jam. The theme was 'Roll of the Dice' (we interpreted the 'Dice' part a bit differently).<br/><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Use the\u00a0<strong>Left-Click Mouse</strong> button to slice and dice the food on your chopping board, quickly but carefully slicing along the coloured lines. </li><li>Use the <strong>Space</strong> <strong>Key</strong> to season your foods for added bonuses, at the cost of losing some time (indicated by the thermometer).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Cut up as much goods and slide them away as fast as possible to gather points, until the time runs out. But be warned: the Chef might want to have a word with you once time runs out...</li><li>Strategically use your knife and your seasoning at the same time to get a high score!</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Thank you for playing our entry! <br/></p>\n<p>Credits :-</p>\n<p>Sapient44 - Game Designer and QA</p>\n<p>Sackbot32/Paulussoler , LuckySauce/Risu - Programming</p>\n<p>JustWiz, Upscalevoyage - Art\u00a0</p>\n<p>GravySurfKing\u00a0- Music and SFX</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T08:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/4345da2f77dc2316cc5b89480c3e7dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sapient44", "GravySurfKing", "luckysauce", "wiz", "PaulusSoler", "Upscalevoyage"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
