The theme was: GENRE without MECHANIC. I chose to create a falling-blocks puzzle game without a singular \"down\" direction.</p>\n<p>It's like tetris, but with a center point instead of a floor. Try to make rectangles around a central square, and the surrounding blocks will fall into place. Some may overlap, but the resulting block is worth more points! In classic tetris fashion, clearing multiple rectangles with one piece will net many more points, but be careful:\u00a0the more you clear, the faster the game gets.</p><p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use the left and right arrow keys to move the piece left and right, the space key to drop the piece,\u00a0the up arrow key and left control key to rotate the piece, and the z and / keys to rotate everything else. Escape and alt+f4 both close the application.</p><p>I didn't get time to fix aspect ratio issues, so please choose one that is 16:9. (1920x1080 or 1280x720, usually)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/856/85633f7124e185e4c496cc2f16d5202b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["schine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
