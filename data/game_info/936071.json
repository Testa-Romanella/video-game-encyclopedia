The goal was to teach\u00a0users about\u00a0dark game design patterns and malicious monetization schemes.\u00a0The game never reached a working state and source files don't exist anymore.\u00a0<br/><br/>Through this project I explored complex management systems with inspiration drawn from Game Dev Tycoon and\u00a0Reigns. The massive overscoping, limited time and non-existent resources did not allow this game to reach a working state, but it remains an idea I'd like to revisit in the future.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T19:44:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44b/44b54b7dc20ce8593ba8603b63e5b410.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick A.
