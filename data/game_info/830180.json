Each player starts out as a \"Ghost\" who must possess monsters in order to use their abilities to rack up more monster kills. Each monster has different types of movement, attacks and HPs.<br/><br/>Ranged attacks are strong but will consume mana. Melee attacks are weak and will refill mana.<br/><br/>The player that has the most points when time runs out is the winner.<h3>Support</h3><br/>We will make improvements to the game and it will continue to be developed.<br/><br/><ul><li>UI/UX improvements<br/></li><li>New mechanics and improvements in Gameplay</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T06:16:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b398a3ed19f1a53c7f7c8de7945d124a.jpg", "website": "https://efectostudios.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 554, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Efecto Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Efecto Estudios SAS"], "esrb_rating": null}
