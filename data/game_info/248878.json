Bubbleword will test not only your word power but also your presence of mind and quick-thinking ability!<br/><br/>There are six bubbles rising from the sea-bed. Each bubble carries a single alphabet. You must form as many words from these alphabets. A valid word formed causes the bubbles to sink some distance, depending on the length of the word formed. The game ends when the bubbles reach the red line near the surface. <br/><br/>Thanks to all users who have written in with their suggestions over the years!
