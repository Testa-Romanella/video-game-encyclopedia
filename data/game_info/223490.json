Unlike in other games, resources are limited and expansion will create conflict. Military tactics, politics, diplomacy, you need to get everything in place to win the game. \u201d<br/><br/>5/5 \u201cIt's wonderful to find a game for my iPhone that requires a lot of strategy. You really have to plan things out ahead of time to achieve them. I haven't spent a dime on this game either. It's not one that you have to put money into it to be competitive. \u201d<br/><br/>5/5 \u201cThus far the game is solid, while showing face to the people and not the spenders. Strategy is evolving into a deeply competitive play. Even at the ground level if things. Worth the time to trial it out.
