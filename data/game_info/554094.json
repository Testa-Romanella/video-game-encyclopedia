I was the main artist who created most of the assets, I was also the game designer before the programmer redid everything I made because he had hard coded the room 's layout in his version of the game. Making our gits incompatible. <br/></p>\n<p>Basically I did the 3D modeling, and came up with the initial core concept but the content was scrapped by the programmer. The changes that were made don't make reflect my design choices. \u00a0Such as the giant toolbox in the corner (which was originally a normal one on a table).<br/><br/>You can see the original room was much more spacious and less claustrophobic. <br/></p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Basically I'm still salty about it because I was super proud of my game design and it was basically stripped away without my consultation.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Environmental art by me.<br/>Programming and level design by Adam Hahn.<br/>Valves and Lightbulbs by Aaron Cloet.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c58ef24494dc63cfe8652347cb1a3106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oakieland"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
