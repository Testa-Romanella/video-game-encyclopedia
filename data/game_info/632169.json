This game is for a game jam and was made in under 5 days. I made everything by my own and i hope the graphics are not too bad. The mechanic is that you have to shoot the fishes with bubbles and then they are inside one. If you shot them again they pop and the enemy dies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game isn't finished so theres some bugs but i try to get \u00a0the game into a acceptable state\u00a0until the deadline from the gamejam.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T03:57:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/268/2683806d8b7e3f85414a45a595f7803b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saubstauga"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
