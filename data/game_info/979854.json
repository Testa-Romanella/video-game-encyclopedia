It was a \"Windows Feature\" and you had to go through extra steps to remove it from a computer back then. I know because I needed to know, or I might not have graduated. Now I've relapsed and made the version of Minesweeper that I've always wanted. One that I can sink hours into a single game and still have more to go. An endless mine field.<br/><br/>And for that, I apologize to my fellow Minesweeper addicts. (Sorry, not sorry)<br/><br/>Play on an endless field of mines or try a challenge mode if you want a more finite experience. <br/><ul><li>Blitz mode is a race to complete a number of chunks, the building blocks of each field; how well can you stay on target?<br/></li><li>Time Trial pits you against the timer to see how many points you can earn before time runs.<br/></li><li>Classic mode lets you play a more finite field, up to 128 x 128.</li></ul><br/>Customize the look and feel of the game with different themes or flags. Turn off chording if you're a purist (there's also flag chording). Swap the mouse buttons if you're weird.<br/><br/>And yes, there are still 50/50 situations. I can't prevent them. <strong>BUT</strong> there is way around guessing: defusers. Earn defusers through consistent good play and you can use one to safely click any cell.
