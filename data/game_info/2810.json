In the game you and a friend play as a pair of loose-cannon police partners, given twenty-four hours to crack a case as part of an elite organised crime taskforce.<br />\nPlanning is tactical rather than strategic, players must react in the moment to shootouts as they unfurl, with additional extra time to assess the situation if they are able to surprise their adversaries. Ammo and enemies are plentiful, and combat is punchy and impactful, supported by an extensive destruction system that ensures every shot looks and feels great.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br />\n\u2022 Compete against the clock to solve a case in 24 hours<br />\n\u2022 Online Co-op and Offline split-screen play<br />\n\u2022 &quot;Daily play&quot; with online leaderboards<br />\n\u2022 Randomly generated cases, operations, and environments<br />\n\u2022 Unlockable weapons, traits, and mission types</p>", "metacritic": 60, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-21T01:46:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/1e4/1e4fdbb42b6e14a68c3fc3dd10e28f79.jpg", "website": "http://www.rico-game.com/", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 78, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 6, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 86, "ratings_count": 16, "suggestions_count": 424, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 16, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Rising Star Games", "Ground Shatter"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Rising Star Games", "Ground Shatter"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
