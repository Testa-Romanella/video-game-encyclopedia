{"id": 137626, "slug": "rock-n-roland", "name": "Rock N' Roland", "name_original": "Rock N' Roland", "description": "<p>Rock N' Roland is a platformer/beat-em-up game focused on fast-paced action. Using Roland's abilities and your platforming skills, you must defeat all the enemies in each level within the time limit. Regularly spawning powerups will help you overcome your opposition and rake in big points!</p><p>Rock N' Roland was finished in February 2014, and was a very important project for me as a programmer. The game had more programming, design, and polish than anything I had ever made beforehand, and it taught me what kind of work it takes to build a game. Rock N' Roland is short, difficult, and rough around the edges, as I was still very much in the learning stage while developing it. The things I learned while making this game, however, will hopefully carry me on to bigger and more refined projects. </p><p>I have decided to release this game for free on itch.io (it was previously $1.00 on IndieCity and the Humble store) because it is my humble hope that people will play this game and give me critical feedback on what they did and did not like about it. My hope is to start working on a sequel in the near future, but I want to ensure that this sequel is tailored to my audience's needs (as opposed to my own, as was the case with the original). I want to know if this game is fun, enjoyable, or even playable for people other than myself!</p><p>So please - take a moment to play the game for a bit and let me know what you think. Game development is just a passionate hobby for me at this point, but I would love to improve and learn as much as possible from this game. Thank you very much!</p><p>-Sean Lenox/Dr. Kwack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62f/62fccceb6f7531980ee5b56cfeb07a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WindmillHill"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
