The theme of the jam was to make a violent genre non-violent. I love roguelikes and I thought it would be interesting to think about why these monsters are living in a dungeon. Perhaps they have more of a right to be there than the \"hero\".<br/><br/>This is just the demo version! I hope to release the full version this year on steam! It will have more creatures and another biome after the swamp. Join the discord to suggest new features and hang out with the dev! I'm trying to make this game better one step at a time!<br/><br/>Also please comment with any feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>Music made for My Cousin the Rogue by manadream<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T12:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/558fb9e270b1df9c27785c7f0871db52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["patrickriordan"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
