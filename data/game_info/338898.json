The red \"power ups\" will make the enemies shoot 2 beams instead of one.</p>\n<p>I should revisit this project still as there are two health bars. The one that is working is the smallest, in the upper left corner!</p><p>Controls are arrow keys to move left and right, space to shoot. Apparently clicking the \"select level\" crashes the game :(</p><p>Will fix that in a future build.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T04:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd4/bd4d5459120a846023bba62ee12fd489.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zadda - Mike"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
