At night... The owl will be awake. When that hapens, be slow or duck other wise, the owl will chase you. If you get hit, you lose a life. If you lose all of them, the game is over and you will see how many acorns you got.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T09:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39e/39ef5605518ef62801b378c5a3096283.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PixelVerse47"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
