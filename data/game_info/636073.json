According to github I made this in october 2019, but I think the first prototype was made months before that.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>It is a variant of my puzzle game 'mean8', but this game is more open-ended and includes random elements. The goal is still to <strong>make an eight </strong>from the numbers that the conveyor belts spit out. Apparently this version is the <em>easy </em>one where undo <em>kinda works </em>but that's alright you might need the leeway.<br/></p>\n<p>The key in the game bar includes helpful tips and gifs, if you're not the explorey type you shouldn't feel any shame in just checking them right away. I certainly won't judge you ;) <strong>Access the hints menu by pressing H and the level select by pressing L</strong>.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:08:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eeaf5997d8a8b511c96d8fc7422cefdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["minotalen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
