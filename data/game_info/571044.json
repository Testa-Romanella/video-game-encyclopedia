Because it's\u00a0a rage game, you will probably fall down a lot, but as you get used to the controls you'll learn how to catch your falls and develop creative shortcuts to regain your progress faster than ever. Even though reaching the top of the cave is a commendable achievement, it is only the start of your journey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Worm Adventure 4 has deeper movement than any other rage game on the\u00a0market, to the point where after hundreds of hours playing, I personally am\u00a0still discovering new techniques.\u00a0The controls are very simple--you can turn, tilt, jump, and grapple--but when combined, they offer an almost limitless amount of movement options to an experienced player.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Connecting to multiplayer is as easy as clicking a single button! Play online with up to 12 friends at a time, and if you don't have friends to play with (don't worry, it happens), then you can still play with other strangers online. Collect and show off your favorite skins as you climb your way to the top.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T07:51:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5bd2bfb5ef2a11d44589168dbb3b3c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lummie Thief"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
