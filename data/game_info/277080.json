He tries to forget about reality by dreaming about his wife. He wants to take her with him to the real world, but he can't. Slowly he realizes that just dreaming about his wife doesn't help him, so he learns to let her go. I made this game on my own in 72 hours for MiniJam 17 with the theme \"Home Alone\".</p>\n\n<p>Important info:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- One of the limitations of this game jam was that we weren't allowed to implement mouse input, so you'll have to navigate through the menu's with the arrow keys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- There is no restart button, because I designed every level so you cannot fail a level. No matter what you do, you will always be able to finish the level. So if you think you need to restart; you don't need it. Just keep puzzling :)</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- WASD/Arrow keys</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb7/cb7c64b88e8bfcf71a439ac27016f990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jens Steenmetz"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
