Sometimes, a red line follows you trying to catch up with you as it erases all the\r\n            letters it touches, so hurry up!\r\n        </p>\n<p>\r\n            See the attached images for more details on keyboard, xbox and playstation controllers.\r\n        </p>\n<p> <strong> SPECIAL MOVEMENTS </strong> </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Double jump</strong> The player can perform another jump while in the air as if it was on the ground.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n<strong> Crouch </strong> If the player is stopped or in walk mode, it can crouch down to pass under low surfaces.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n<strong> Slide </strong> If the player is running it can perform a slide, getting down and proceeding with much more\r\n            speed than the normal crouch.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n<strong> Dash </strong>The player gets a strong acceleration in the direction he is watching.\r\n        </p>\n<p>\n<strong> Roll </strong> The player performs a roll while in the air and it immediately stops the horizontal speed.\r\n        </p>\n<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n            Please use this form to leave us feedback on the game.
