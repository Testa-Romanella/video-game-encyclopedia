The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?</p>\n<p>Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series&#39; trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character&#39;s health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called &quot;DNA points,&quot; which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-14T04:38:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6ee/6eebc13368f0010bed3deb7cd4ba5f0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 3, "beaten": 6, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["Eighting Co."], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": null}
