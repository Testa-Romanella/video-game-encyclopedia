The first collection of Sherlock Holmes stories appeared in 1892, entitled The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.</p>\n<p>This game takes you through four of those stories, including <em>A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-Headed League, A Case of Identity </em>and <em>The Man With the Twisted Lip</em>. Not only will you read the classic tales, but you will occasionally be prompted to make choices as to what Sherlock's assistant, Dr. Watson, does. Read along with Holmes, and see if you can solve the mystery before he does!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your support.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a28387a9602af2abd30d0440e23ce84.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arglefumph"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
