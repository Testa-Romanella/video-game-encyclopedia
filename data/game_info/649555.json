The story is still under construction, the bosses and enemies will go through changes later on and I intend to put a lot more things in the game like enemies, powerups, tutorials, item list and more things in the hud like showing how much damage is dealing to the enemy and make them stronger procedurally, along with the player who can get stronger. Die once and you'll restart the game from the beginning!!\r\nMy cousin's instagram: @skull_bit \r\nMy instagram: @eriick.monteiro\r\n\r\n<p>A little project in progress. The Final boss is a Bill Cypher (Iluminatti) because I don't a definity art of him yet, but his programation is finisshed!!
