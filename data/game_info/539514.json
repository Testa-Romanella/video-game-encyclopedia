Now the cat has a new mission: He must sneak <strong>into an old hotel </strong>with no windows, <strong>find all the spies</strong> and <strong>listen </strong>to them all.</p>\n<p>*But there are some troubles. The<strong> cat is constantly hungry</strong> and during the mission you will<strong> need to feed the cat</strong> for the cat to obey orders. You <strong>should also avoid telephones, radios and televisions.</strong> These items cause interference in the cat's earphone, which leads to stress. With a<strong> high level of stress</strong>, the <strong>cat stops obeying orders</strong>.</p>\n<p>* You, as an operator, will follow the cat using video surveillance cameras. You will hear all the commands that you give to the cat, and all the conversations of the red spies.</p>\r\nControl\r\n<p><strong>The description of the control is in the game, but here I duplicate it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W</strong> - Move cat forward;</p>\n<p><strong>S</strong> - Stop;\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A,D</strong> - Rotate to left, right;\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> - some action;\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>&lt;-</strong> and <strong>-&gt; </strong>change active camera in toom.</p>\r\nSome number\r\n<ul><li><strong>Cat bowl: +40 </strong>food<strong>, -25 </strong>stress</li><li><strong>Telephone:</strong>\u00a0<strong>+20 </strong>stress<strong>, 80%\u00a0</strong>Activation chance</li><li><strong>Radio:</strong>\u00a0<strong>+50\u00a0</strong>stress<strong>, 45%\u00a0</strong>Activation chance</li><li><strong>TV:</strong>\u00a0<strong>+70\u00a0</strong>stress<strong>, 45%\u00a0</strong>Activation chance</li></ul>\r\nOther\r\n<p>In the main menu you can:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Adjust sound</li><li>Set the settings for the next hotel.
