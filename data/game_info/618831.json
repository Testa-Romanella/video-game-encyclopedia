I\u2019m Maria, I\u2019m a 21-year-old Game Design student in my 6th semester from Germany. I have worked with Unity for about three years now and am happy to show what I have learned in this Game Jam. I wrote the game\u2019s code, implemented to Assets &amp; the UI and made the VFX/Shaders/Materials for the game. Everything I did in the project was created during the jam.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Hello, Daniel here. I am 19 years old and currently in a vocational training to become a graphic- and web designer. This is the second game jam I have worked on. My job was to create the art for the game - this includes the initial concepts, color palettes, 3D models, textures, sound effects as well as music and UI. On the last day of the jam, I also focused on the presentation of the game online. The game assets were created in blender, the music was made in GarageBand. We have used sound effects from different online sources that require no crediting. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing and commenting!</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62d/62d11d66d410fd561fa6082a6ca7e72c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tranquilmage"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
