Every time your reload bar fills up, the number of the ball you are about to shoot doubles. The number on the ball inicates how many pixels you can recolor on the screen.\u00a0But be careful! If you wait too much your enemies may attack you. If your base (where your number is written) gets recolored, you die. You may also want to recolor the ball at the centre of the field as if you recolor it to your color, your starting number will be duplicated.</p>\n<p>The game gets harder every time you recolor some area on the screen. The ball at the center moves away from you and your reload time increases. But it works the other way too. If your area on the screen is small, you will be able to shoot more often and you will be able to recolor the centre easier as it moves towards you.\u00a0This way the game will be balanced so that you have a chance of winning no matter how much area you own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Q - Red</strong></p>\n<p><strong>O - Green</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Y - Blue</strong></p>\n<p><strong>M - Yellow</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f517cc04ad1df905c8709e5385077e5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["EsVagy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
