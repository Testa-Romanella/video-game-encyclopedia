Inspired by various other tactical shooter games, Zero Hour tries to bring a very grounded Team vs Team experience in locations with real-life scale (no video game scale) and resource management. Both sides are tasked to wipe out the other team and complete objectives. The defenders are tasked to protect the bomb from being defused and keep their hostage from being rescued and running away. On the contrary, the attackers are to defuse the bomb or rescue the hostage held captive. It brings a grounded, close quarter combat experience to the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-21T16:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd0/bd0b4507007663aea1afb0d40a75d7f0.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/zerohour2020/", "rating": 3.67, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 5, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 369, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Rating Pending"}
