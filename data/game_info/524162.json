I hope you enjoy it! I plan to keep competing in jams so keep an eye out for future projects. All art and music were created by me and I wrote the code myself with help from channels such as Brackeys. Deja Vu features only one level, however the parts of this level have been broken up to create many levels as you try and remember what your world looked like. Thanks again for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Places You Can Find Me:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>YouTube</p>\n<p>Twitch</p>\n<p>Twitter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:00:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/895/895def8bfd1c4c4f4981446435c63172.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wyfried"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
