You win the game if these 6 numbers are the ones chosen by the lottery. The numbers picked by the lottery are always random.</p>\n<p>Each time you bet and lose, you go one unit in debt. Each time you win, you get one million units as prize.</p>\n<p>Enable the Auto Bet function to make the game automatically bet the same numbers infinitely. Each bet pushes the in game time forward by one week. That way you can get a rough idea of how long it'd take to win IRL.</p>\n<p>Game also runs while on background, so you can let it run for a long time to see what happens.</p>\n<p>Made with UI assets by KenneyNL.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T05:28:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b33/b334454b9a0d497657c574b68d212158.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["implementer76"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
