Player discretion is advised.<br />\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways.<br />\nVisage is a first-person psychological horror game.<br />\nExplore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience.EnvironmentThe game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You\u2019ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn&#39;t even bear imagining.<br />\nStorylineThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You\u2019ll soon wish you could join the dead&#39;s ranks in their abyss, but death won&#39;t help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?<br />\nDark entitiesThe families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They\u2019ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.<br />\nGameplayIn Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You\u2019ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.<br />\nDying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you&#39;ll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2020-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T09:36:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ddd/dddfb91aca79241e7b428ef21052e5ad.jpg", "website": "http://visagethegame.com/", "rating": 3.38, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 570, "beaten": 57, "toplay": 82, "dropped": 69, "playing": 13}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 162, "ratings_count": 121, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 122, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["SadSquare Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SadSquare Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
