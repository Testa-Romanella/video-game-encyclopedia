You have to piece together what happened and why you find yourself in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>The game follows the memories of Tom, a man who is having a very bad day at the end of a very bad life. The only thing that you know, at the start of the game is that he has had his memories stolen 40 years before his time, which has corrupted the brain scan. It is up to you to put the brain scan back together and figure out what has happened.</p>\n\n<p>The game is still very much in development, so we would love to get some feedback on the game. please leave a comment about anything you feel could be improved or is important to be noted.</p>\n<p>It is important for us to provide the best experience possible.</p>\n\n<p>The reset was developed by a two man team, Sylvester how is in charge of programming and art and S\u00f8ren who is in charge of the music.
