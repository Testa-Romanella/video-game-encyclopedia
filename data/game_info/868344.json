Press A (X) to lock the cursor and use the dpad to choose the swap direction.<br/></p>\n<p>Every lap will have a shiny fruit, indicated by the \"x2\" beside it on the right side of the screen (and by 2 stars below it at the start of each lap). Matching the shiny fruit gives double points. When falling fruit leads to additional matches, these are called \"passes\" and each subsequent pass doubles the points awarded!</p>\n<p>Pressing the B (Z) button will use a wrench and briefly flash all possible matches. New wrenches are awarded every 100,000 points.<br/></p>\n<p>When there are no moves available the grid will clear and a bonus will be awarded.</p>\n<p>When the timer runs out the game is over.</p>\r\nBeta Notes\r\n<p>I have a whole bunch of ideas to juice up the game when I find the time, in addition to fitting more music in the 32KB ROM, but I wanted to get a beta release out for additional feedback.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\nKeyboard\r\nGame Boy\r\nActionEnter\r\nStart\r\nAdvance/PauseTab\r\nSelect\r\nToggle palette on title/pause screenX\r\nA\r\nConfirm/LockZ\r\nB\r\nCancel/HintsArrow keys\r\nD-Pad\r\nMove and choose swap direction\r\n<p>Select can be pressed on the title/pause screen to toggle palettes for different display types.</p>\r\nTools Used:\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul><li>RGBDS\r\n</li><li>Emulicious\r\n</li><li>Aseprite\r\n</li><li>hUGETracker\r\n</li><li>Visual Studio Code\r\n</li><li>binjgb\u00a0by binji (itch.io web player)\r\n</li><li>JS GB Emulator (GB Studio Fork)\u00a0by\u00a0Chris Maltby (web player mobile controls)\r\n</li></ul>\r\nAdditional Code/Assets:\r\n<ul><li>gb-starter-kit by ISSOtm\r\n</li><li>hUGEDriver by Superdisk\r\n</li><li>Sound Effect Driver and BCD functions by PinoBatch\r\n</li><li>HiScore Library by H.
