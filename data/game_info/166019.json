Let me introduce you Klabi, the sweet cat, who has a sweet tooth. This little rascal loves sweets and big, very big - no - HUGE SWEET CAKES! <br/><br/>This game is all about sweets as you might have realized and you can make Klabi's sweet dream(s) come true. In this simple platformer, you play Klabi in his dream through levels of raining sugar, dropping calorie bombs and sticky sticks of rocks called candy sticks, meow! <br/><br/>Attention Kids! Klabi's dream can turn into a sour nightmare before he reaches his goal to collect all the sweets to build his enormous pie. Because other little sweet-guzzlers appear and want to have a piece of the cake before Klabi even has all the ingredients. <br/><br/>Will you help Klabi to fullfil his dream, kids? If yes, please be so kind to vote for it to get this light green sugar here first. That would be so sweeeeet! Meow! </p><p>Vote   </p><p>steam greenlight </p><p>http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a30e42771bd3c75944d8d5ada1ebfc89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["sana800"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
