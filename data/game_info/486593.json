He should have a keycard for you. You need 7 in\u00a0order to get the keycard.<br/>+ If you have issues with the mask try not looking directly at them or rapid smash the A button.<br/>+ If you have issues with the shy guy just won't walk up there.<br/>+ \u00a0If you have issues with 106 just find a closet. he'll really only catch you by cutting corners. This may change later.<br/>+ Dodging 682 is easier then it looks. wait for him to swing, disappear and then BOOK IT.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a very small game I made to test the logistics and feasibility for GB Studio 2.0.
