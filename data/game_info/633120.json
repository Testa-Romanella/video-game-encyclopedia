The player begins his journey as a freelancer in the underworld, gradually gaining fame and receives more and more lucrative orders.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The mission is a set of small maps - the size can be viewed in the game Hitman Go, with randomization - presented in the test build in the form of a different location of the enemy. The end result of the mission is the elimination of a specific target, this is possible in several ways: shoot, blow up, set up an accident.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Also on the map, the player is given a limited ammunition, designed for a certain number of enemies. In the technical demo, this is 3 rounds. To kill an enemy or kill a player, one shot is enough, the closest analogue is Hotline Miami.\r\n</p>\n<p>All these conditions create a kind of analogue of strategic gameplay.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T08:01:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/501/501a101ba08b273ceb9f2debbff12aed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdvanceSG"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
