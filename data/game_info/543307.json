{"id": 543307, "slug": "elf-intern", "name": "Elf Intern", "name_original": "Elf Intern", "description": "<p>A variety game where you play as the new intern at Santa Corp a couple of days before Christmas when everything goes wrong. Each level type addresses one or more of the prompts from the jam<br/></p>\n<p>Slide Puzzle - Click the tile you want to move to find the missing item in the motor pool.\u00a0(Slide + Reveal)</p>\n<p>Connect Puzzle - Rotate the pipes to redirect power from the backup generator to the polar reactor. (Connect + Revolve/Orientation)\u00a0-\u00a0Left\u00a0click to\u00a0rotate clockwise,\u00a0right\u00a0click\u00a0to\u00a0rotate\u00a0counter\u00a0clockwise</p>\n<p>Find the Reindeer - Press E to ring the bell and find the reindeer. Return them to the stables and save Christmas!\u00a0(Sound +\u00a0Illumination + tenuous use of Recover)\u00a0WASD\u00a0to\u00a0move.</p>\n<p>Mince Pie Eating Contest - (Consume) Press the key/mouse button that responds to the lowest mince pie and win the contest! Each missed pie will go to your opponents. Watch out! Each wrong press makes the game harder as the pies will fall faster and all the pies on screen will be sent to your opponents, increasing their scores!<br/></p>\n<p>I had a few more ideas for levels including a toy builder, taking parts from the parts bins and putting together toys for the creation and possibly orientation prompts, a point and click/memory game where you had to find your elfy co-workers after lunch for the reveal/flip prompts but alas time was against me. I'm happy with what I got done.\u00a0i'd say\u00a08-9\u00a0prompts from\u00a04 level types isn't too\u00a0bad :)</p>\n<p>A large portion of the assets are CC0 or similarly licensed. Updated before deadline with some additional polishing just to make it look nicer. Linux and Mac builds are untested but hopefully should work OK.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:42:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/065/06596963e1a055189a8a341cbcae348e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["drentsoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
