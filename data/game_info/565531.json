We had previously made a couple of overly ambitious attempts at making a game that we never were able to finish. Based on those experiences, we decided to this time make a game with limited scope and complexity. After researching classical puzzles and games, we decided that\u00a0the Hanoi puzzle tower\u00a0would be a good fit for us.</p>\n<p>To put our own twist on it, we would build the tower in the form of a snowman. We really liked the sound of \u00abThe Snowman from Hanoi,\u00bb but it did sound kind of far-fetched\u2026 But much to our surprise, a web search taught us that there was a\u00a0snowfall in the Hanoi region\u00a0in January 2016! So the project title stayed and went on to be the title of the finished game.</p>\n<p>We used the\u00a0Godot Game Engine\u00a0for programming the game. The first sketches for the graphics were made in\u00a0Procreate (iPad)\u00a0\u2013 the final art was made with\u00a0Affinity Designer (iPad).</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Tower of Hanoi puzzle game</li><li>Three difficulty levels</li><li>High score based on number of moves and time</li><li>Original art</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong><br/></p>\n<ol><li>Move only one part at a time.</li><li>Each move consists of taking the upper part from one stack and placing it on top of another stack.</li><li>Move only the\u00a0uppermost part of a stack.</li><li>No part may be placed on top of a smaller part.</li></ol>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>The music and sounds for the game are from\u00a0storyblocks.com.</p>\n<p><strong>We quite like the finished result, and we hope you will download and give it a go.
