There are multiple types of enemies that get harder and faster with every level. Defeat wave after wave in each level and defeat the end boss to advance to the next level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Early enemies are slow and shoot occasionally and can be defeated with a single shot but as levels progress, new enemies appear that not only require multiple shots but also move faster and shoot more often. Avoid being hit by those pesky asteroids and remember to pick up those powerups to give you that advantage!</p>\n<p>Be warned, this is a very competitive and addictive game :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T04:33:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39a/39ae6e3bf71fd7b9c7c0a6891d51532d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Capuman"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
