Unlike before where I made the game from scratch using JavaScript, this time I made the game in Godot. I reused some of the assets from the original game and I made a few more as well. Don't worry these are only temporary as I plan to do a complete overhaul of the sprites and music later on. This is just a demo/prototype to see if the mechanics and gameplay work well. I hope you enjoy this game and please give me feedback, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T06:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/693/693ae1dfd13f25c9750a9be9ae082561.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Egtab1"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
