I have no plan to commercialize it but I decided to release it for you guys to try out for free!</p>\n<p>ENTRENCHED is a 2D side-scrolling shooter game set in WW1 era. You are a surviving soldier fighting against hordes of zombies.</p>\n<p>The game is in the development stage. It is an experimental project for me to try out some coding and scripts to create a shooter game in Unity. It features an immersive weapon handling system I made on my own.</p>\n<p>The weapon handling system features a custom amount of aiming sway radius, speed, recoil, and weapon manipulations and mechanics for each weapon (automatic handgun having slide lock back when firing last round, etc.)<br/><br/>Feel free to give comments or share some interesting thoughts or have a look at the source code if you are making games on Unity, but don't expect the game to be finished anytime soon. *finger crossed*<br/><br/><strong>I hope you enjoy it!
