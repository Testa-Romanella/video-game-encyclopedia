The goal was to make something that was fun to watch, so I tried to make a fighting game that created tense, sudden moments like you'd see in an old western or samurai movie.</p>\n<p>There are two players, and the only controls are to attack and block. Whoever hits their opponent first wins the round. Blocks have to be well timed to work, and if a player blocks when the opponent isn't attacking, they're left vulnerable.</p><p>You can reset the game by using the return key.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-11T03:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b79683478ccd0efd5661c1552beb386.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ian Ouellette"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
