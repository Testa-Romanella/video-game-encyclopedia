Everyone but you.</p>\n<p>You've been sent to do some tasks for City King. Could it finally be your time to be given shelter and care in this desolate, unlivable environment? Or are you being singled out for something more sinister?</p>\n\n<p>This game was made in a few weeks\u00a0for a school project. Since then I've changed the color palette and added a menu, but the game could still use some music and more player choices. I may add these in the future, but for now, enjoy Lake Rot!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b3/4b3e1234cdbfdf26a045f396c29fe445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ghoulishkid"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
