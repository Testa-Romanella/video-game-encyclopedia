When 4 players are connected, game starts. The goal is to move your cookie to find the jar in a topdown dungeon with fire and spikes. Each player can move in one direction (up/down/left/right) using the SPACEBAR on his Windows/Mac/Linux or touchscreen on Android phone/wear, symbolized by the arrow of his color next to the cookie. Have fun ! :) The cookie goes back to the start position if killed by fire or spikes. Go back to title screen after you win by pressing SPACE/screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/01a/01ab37136b78388915330cefb74356c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["bouergh", "Kitkaticha", "rooose", "Pyjou"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
