There are also extra game modes that take advantage of the procedural nature of the game : <br/></p>\n<ul><li><em>Limited </em>mode is sort of a \"Roguelike\" mode : you play using only a very limited pool of pieces. Get to know your more complicated pieces and work around them! I think of it as a Roguelike because some runs will have more luck than others, but will always allow you to adapt to what you've been dealt.</li><li><em>Custom </em>mode alows you to change most aspects of the game : piece weights by size, grid dimensions, win conditions, and so on.</li></ul>\n<p>This is more of a fun personnal project than anything else, made because I wanted to work on feedback and game feel. <br/></p><p>(If it gets enough attention, I'll get to working on extra features, such as custom key bindings. I'll be open to suggestions too!)</p>\n<p>Feel free to report any bugs you encounter.<br/></p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Controls and manual are all included in the game itself, including button promps on the bottom of the screen for menu navigation. </p>\n<p>The game has been configured for keyboard, XBOX 360 controller, and PS4 controller. It has not been tested with an XBOX One controller, but the key bindings should be the same as the 360.</p>\n<p>I personally recommend using a PS4 controller, for the d-pad.<br/></p>\r\nDemo &amp; Downloads\r\n<p>The game in the web player is a demo. It is also available for download. <br/></p>\n<p>The full game can be purchased and downloaded.</p>\n<p>As I cannot test Mac/Linux builds myself, please let me know if something doesn't work as intended!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The game was made by me, Piers Bishop.<br/></p>\n<p>The backgrounds were created by Flopine.</p>\n<p>The music was composed by Alexander J Lewis.</p>\n\n<p>The SFX are by DustyRoom, LittleRobotSoundFactory, and SoundBits, on Unity Asset Store, VIRIX on soundcloud.com, and deleted_user_229898 on freesound.org.</p>\n<p>Fonts are public domain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T08:07:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f81/f81bb2101e6b1ca55b5e8bf6aed95d85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Piers Bishop"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
