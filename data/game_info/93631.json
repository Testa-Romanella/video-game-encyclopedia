Solve puzzles, feed your beastie, and enjoy the slow coastal vibe. Five levels in total.<br/></p>\n<p>Made in a little over a week for an in-house game-jam. We wanted to focus on simple mechanics, clarity, and setting a clear and definitive tone.<br/></p>\n<p>The idea was to make a version of 'Flipper' that featured a painfully slow manatee instead of a dolphin. While we were going for slow torment.. it ended up a bit endearing, somehow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jupiter Lighthouse Studio</strong></p>\n<p>Andrew Hilderbrand (@olgimpy) </p>\n<p>Dylan Engelman (@lordofduct)</p>\n\n<p>Updates: </p>\n<p>5.16.2015 -- progression blocker on level 2 fixed! </p>\n<p>7.31.2015 -- Updated Spacepuppy Framework, fixed shadow not casting for girl, updated pathfinding engine (hopefully less buggy)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533f9498bc82081f54c6588819af790f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Jupiter Lighthouse"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
