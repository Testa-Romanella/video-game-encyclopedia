{"id": 830130, "slug": "chunkers", "name": "Chunkers", "name_original": "Chunkers", "description": "Chunkers is a <strong>casual, multiplayer, voxel-based first-person shooter</strong>. Set during a war on a far-away exoplanet where two sides, a corporation and a cult, fight over a mysterious element. Pick a side and destroy your enemies using a variety of weapons, or use your pickaxe to dig tunnels, build bridges and re-make the entire map to your liking.<br/><br/><h3>Control point</h3><ul><li>The goal is to capture a deposit of the rare element and hold it for a longer period of time than the enemy team</li><li>Preceeding the main gameplay is a short building phase where the teams are separated by a barrier and can build defenses, start digging tunnels before meeting the enemy team head on</li></ul><h3>Team deathmatch</h3><ul><li>No real objective, the teams attack each other and the team with the largest amount of kills wins</li></ul><br/>As the game comes closer to release, we're planning on adding a zombies mode as well as many other different gameplay modes.<br/><br/><br/>Chunkers was designed to allow for easy map creation and sharing. There are two ways of making a map for Chunkers:<br/><ul><li><strong>Design the map in-game and save it from the menu</strong>. As a server admin, you can use the 'creative' command to give yourself every block there is and design the map from within the engine. You can also self-host a server and design the map with your friends. And yes, you can save how the map currently looks from any server you're currently connected to as well.</li><li><strong>Use a voxel editor</strong>. Chunkers maps are saved in a voxel format that's usually used for voxel art. Any editor supporting this format can be used to edit the map. To learn more about this, check out our documentation.</li></ul><br/>Chunkers also features many interesting blocks that interact with their surroundings. For example:<br/><ul><li><strong>Lava</strong> gives damage to any player walking over it</li><li><strong>The Piston</strong> bounces the player high into the air when stepped on</li><li><strong>The Explosive</strong> ignites when shot and explodes in a little while after</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T05:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/158/1587a9d52556e9d44b0fda8858ad0c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["brimstone.studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["brimstone.studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
