Inspired very loosely by the Pokemon Tabletop games I used to play.</p>\n<p>It's entirely too hard (though that suits the jam theme). The hit rates are too low, and the animations are a bit janky. I also wanted to implement a more Final-Fantasy-Tactics-esque turn system, but it was beyond the scope of the time I had. Overall it's an interesting experiment, but a bit of a frustrating engine to use for this purpose.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T10:17:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/968/968ab570b0d8dce3744fc1788f88ef7c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["necroharpy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
