Flip, Fall down, rage, get up, keep flipping!<br/><br/>Hey everyone, my name is Jeff Weber and I've been making physics games in my spare time for over 10 years.  Just Flip is my latest and greatest!  <br/>Like all my physics games, it gets to the point quick with minimal fluff and nonsense.  Just fire it up and start flipping.<h3>The Controls</h3>The controls in Just Flip are simplistic in concept, but require a little practice to get a feel for the inertia of the flip.  The launch and flip mechanic has been honed, tweaked, and iterated-on for over a year to make it smooth and satisfying.<br/><br/>Just pull down and back sling-shot style anywhere on the screen and release to launch. Once in the air, mouse down to crouch or release to extend.  Stick the landing and repeat.<h3>The World</h3>Inspired by the world of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, Just Flip consists of a single large continuous mountain of stuff to flip over. You will not be artificially teleported back to the start if you fail to stick a landing, you will simply get back up and keep flipping. Of course, if you fail to stick the landing in the wrong place, gravity might have a say in where you end up.<br/><br/><br/>Now, get flipping over that mountain!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09c/09cd4652634e9c8cda7ca2a0c64f2add.jpg", "website": "http://www.farseergames.com/justski/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jeff Weber"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Jeff Weber"], "esrb_rating": null}
