It runs better as an EXE so I recommend that you download it, though I'm glad the browser version is functional as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T04:54:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3f/d3f44f0f7c5081bdf8e775ea8f2c3256.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mi1k"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
