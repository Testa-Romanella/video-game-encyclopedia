The neighbor's dog is barking at 6 AM! The old man has no choice but to give that neighbor a piece of his mind!</p>\n<p>Play as a cranky old man who just wants to enjoy his retirement but keeps running into neighborhood disturbances. Along the way, you'll get to know your noisy neighbors--and who knows, maybe the old man will warm up to them...just a little.</p>\n<p>This game was created for ACM Studio Reverse Game Jam 2021 with the theme \"Less is more.\" The goal of the Reverse Game Jam was to let developers experience roles unfamiliar to them; for example, someone who usually programs has to do the art, UI, or sound design.</p>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Walk with WASD/arrow keys\u00a0and press the spacebar to interact with nuisances. Make the old man feel false hope that his day will improve\u00a0whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, use the mouse to navigate!</p>\n<p>Press 'esc' to skip text boxes. Press 'p' to toggle instant text.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>NEEDS TO BE PLAYED IN FULLSCREEN.</li><li>Some props are missing flavor text.\r\n</li><li>The game ends after you go to bed. Sorry, there is no clear indicator that it's the ending. Just exit the game at that point.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><em>Version 4 Fixes (Post-Game Jam)</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>(Fixed v4) For the very first textbox, click on the old man to advance. Subsequent text boxes can be advanced with either spacebar or the mouse.</li><li>(Fixed v4) Ignore the \"Interactable text\"\u00a0floating at the top of the first room..</li><li>(Fixed v4) Be careful to not tap space too fast as you may end up skipping dialogue that way.</li><li>(Fixed v4) If you get stuck behind the fixer truck, click the bottom of the screen to advance.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>Alexander Chen - Main Programmer</p>\n<p>Ashley Lu - Character/Prop Artist</p>\n<p>Brandon Truong - Composer/Sound Design<br/></p>\n<p>Jess Xu - Character Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Johnny Wan - Background Artist<br/></p>\n<p>Ray Hsiao - Programmer/Writer<br/></p>\n<p>Ryan Vuong - UI Developer</p>\n<p>SFX courtesy of ZapSplat (did not get implemented)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T09:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d01/d011166e2d0f3b123ee6e08170faf01e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JohnnyWan", "Ray Hsiao", "Brandmuffin", "crochop", "rvuong", "jabenero", "altairs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
