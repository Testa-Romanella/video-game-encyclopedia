Enchanted sprites work together to defeat slimy invaders in a whimsical setting full of glimmering shadows. Connect, co-operate or betray to win! <br/><br/>Join your thorny tether together with your friends to run down enemies. Players are helpless on their own, and must pair up with a partner to destroy enemies and assist each other. Succeed as a team, or fail alone! <br/><br/>Play with up to four players to overcome the slimey swarms and defeat the slime king in adventure mode. Pull your partner to safety and over obstacles with the press of a button. Share a variety of powerups with your friends for amplified effect. Co-ordinate with your partner to mount an offensive, and maneuver to avoid toxic tether breaking attacks.<br/><br/>Master a fluid co-op team system which allows you to partner up and work together, then break ties for a tactical team reshuffle or a swift betrayal. Form temporary alliances in battle mode, then switch partners in the final moments to secure your own selfish victory.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f9/4f9194368a36075db388c786f3247d51.jpg", "website": "http://www.bramblelash.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Bytesprite"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Bytesprite"], "esrb_rating": null}
