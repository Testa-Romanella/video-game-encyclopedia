Mixing in with a parry system to protect yourself and a directional swing, with a parkour system of ledge climbing and wall running for greater mobility.</p>\n<p>- Features 2 simple levels and 3 enemy types, (standard swordsman, sniper, elite swordsman)<br/></p>\n<p>- A\u00a0short prototype, playtime of 10 minutes</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T03:41:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/985/985f7ec954fd03eae8f0e44996d092bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FallNight64"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
