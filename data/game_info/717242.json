It's a post-apocalyptic game where the test of the first nuclear bomb went wrong and mutated insects and eliminated most of the population but I am currently working on adding people that you can encounter during your playthrough and make allies with.\u00a0This game was inspired a lot by the amazing game: LISA: The Painful and\u00a0I would very much appreciate you to leave ideas, suggestions, bugs you found whilst playing, constructive criticism, etc. I am currently\u00a0a 14 year old\u00a0solo indie developer hoping to produce a commercial product.
