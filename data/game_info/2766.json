{"id": 2766, "slug": "puzzle-strike", "name": "Puzzle Strike", "name_original": "Puzzle Strike", "description": "<strong>Puzzle Strike</strong> is a deckbuilding puzzle game played amongst Fantasy Strike characters. It's inspired by puzzle games such as Puzzle Fighter. Gems fall into each player's gem pile every turn, and whoever's gem pile fills up first loses. Improve your deck (of chips!) by purchasing new chips as the game unfolds. Will you go heavy on economy, offense, or build an intricate engine? In any case, make sure to adapt to your opponents because Puzzle Strike has a lot more interactivity than most other deckbuilders. And like the other games in the Fantasy Strike universe, Puzzle Strike is designed to hold up to thousands of games at the expert level, and we fully embrace the philosophy of even-playfield competition.<br/><br/>The new Steam version of Puzzle Strike (as well as the upcoming iOS release) have these new features:<br/><ul><li>Runs natively on Mac, PC, and Linux (new!)<br/></li><li>Cross-platform play with players on iOS (coming soon), Steam or the web version on FantasyStrike.com<br/></li><li>Chips have 4x the resolution as the web version<br/></li><li>Issue challenges to people on your Steam friend list<br/></li><li>Climb the leaderboards in Quick Match and check out replays of top players to improve your game!<br/></li><li>New Puzzle Challenge mode: learn advanced character tactics and think outside the bag!
