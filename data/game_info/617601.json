And when you earn enough, cash them in at the shop for some sweet rewards for your feline friend.</p>\n\n<p>If you're curious, the controls are:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys to move and jump</li><li>Mouse to aim, LMB to shoot and click things</li></ul>\n<p>It was pretty fun making this game - though very stressful towards the end, of course. I found it a fun concept to play around with, and I have a lot of ideas to add to the game if I ever come back (that I would've added already if time wasn't so finite). The artwork I'm especially pleased with, and the limited palette ended up working alright for this game. I hope you had as much fun playing it as I did making it - hopefully with less stress!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and the music links are here:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Menu music:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/theme-song-8-bit</p>\n<p>Game music: https://opengameart.org/content/pulsar-famitracker-2a03</p>\n<p>Ending music: https://opengameart.org/content/chiptune-medieval-minstrel-dance</p><p>P.S sorry about the development build, but other WebGL builds just... wouldn't work.
