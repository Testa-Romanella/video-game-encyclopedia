Whenever the volcano erupts, tons of mutos are spread through the whole island. The islanders, also known as Mutopians, collect the mutos as their main resource and the island becomes wealthier. The Mutopians are looking for a governor, but nobody seems capable of governing this place. Nobody but\u2026you!\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>In a pixel-art world, the player has to make decisions about sometimes trivial, but sometimes more complicated and delicate issues. As the days are passing, a series of events take place in this isolated land of Mutopia. As governor, the player has to choose between two options, and do his/her best to govern the island. Nevertheless, decisions have consequences, and it is not always to easy to discern what is the best decision, and for whom, and at what cost.\u00a0 <br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Programming: Georgia Skartadou</p>\n<p>Sound: Theodore Kogias</p>\n<p>Animation: Andreas Stavrianoudakis &amp; Theodore Kogias</p>\n<p>Game design and writing: Andreas Stavrianoudakis &amp; Artemis Psaltoglou<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T07:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6aa/6aab23807f662b4e72b6386d9d337188.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["artemisps", "JoSkar91", "koyodot", "stavrian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
