{"id": 524462, "slug": "antibody-2", "name": "Antibody", "name_original": "Antibody", "description": "<h3>You are the cure.</h3>Sanguon, an otherwordly and newly discovered planet, has found itself the hotbed for a highly infectious alien lifeform. Incidentally intercepting a distress call from the surface research colony, you conclude the infection rate will outrun your efforts to contact your fellow humans. It is up to your spacefaring ingenuity and the peculiar cleansing capabilities of your allied Chonklers to save Sanguon - and indeed the universe - from Viroid assimilation. <br/><h3>Multitask to victory.</h3><br/>Efficiently and continuously reposition your Chonkler companions to impede the ambient infection. But remain vigilant, as your friendly critters are completely defenseless and will need your maneuverability and firepower to keep them safe as increasingly precarious waves of hostile organisms amass to attack.<br/><h3>Their loss is your gain.</h3><br/>Viroid corruption siphoned by the Chonklers can be converted into powerups by your ship. Radar improvements? Piercing shot? Do you save up for big upgrades, or do you enjoy a flurry of smaller ones? The choice is yours.<br/><h3>A blast from the past, in the present.</h3><br/>A love letter to shoot-em-up classics like Gradius, R-Type and Defender. Undeniably gameplay driven and thoroughly indulging in 80's sci-fi pulp, Antibody is sure to excite arcade enthusiasts.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-30T01:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10b/10b233262e8c24cd846b55dd565cad32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PunchButton Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["PunchButton Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
