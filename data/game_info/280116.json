Place objects and watch them attract to each other gracefully, create cool orbits or cause huge collisions that make loads of cubes fly away!\r\n    <br/>\n</p>\n\n<p>In this physics-based sandbox, every object attracts each other in the same way gravity works in real life\u00a0(well, except that\u00a0gravity here is 20 billion times stronger). So, the more massive something is, the more noticeable its gravitational pull will be!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Create harmony, create chaos, or wait long enough until one becomes another. Place cubes, spheres, cacti, bananas, or a bunch of Earth globes. Or if you wish, turn on <strong>dark mode</strong> and throw a bunch of objects with trails around and watch their colors converge to art!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, did I mention there's also a controllable rocket?</p>\n\n<p>You'll need just a keyboard and a mouse for this one. The list is big, but chill. All you <em>really</em> need to know is that in this\u00a0<strong>First Person </strong>game,\u00a0<strong>Left Mouse uses a tool</strong> and that\u00a0<strong>Tab</strong> lets you choose an object!</p>\n\n\n<p>When you open the options menu, you'll see a bunch of buttons and sliders. They are all quite self explanatory. Well, except for one:\u00a0<strong>the realism slider.</strong> If you wish to sacrifice a bit of scientific accuracy to gain more performance, you may just change it to a lower level! The Gravity Box has 5 levels of realism. Here's what they do:</p>\n\n<p><em>Note that these effects add up as the level decreases. For example, Level 2 also has linear gravity.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\"Bass Soli\" by Kevin MacLeod</li><li>\"Cool Vibes\"\u00a0by Kevin MacLeod</li><li>\"Just as Soon\"\u00a0by Kevin MacLeod</li><li>\"Night on the Docks\"\u00a0by Kevin MacLeod</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound FX</strong></p>\n<p>All sound effects used in this game are derived from Creative Commons 0 works extracted from Freesound.org.</p>\n<p><strong>Creator, Designer, Artist, Programmer</strong></p>\n<p>HenryCGS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/103/1039f8bdb89bc1d3132bc772f604ec4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["HenryCGS"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
