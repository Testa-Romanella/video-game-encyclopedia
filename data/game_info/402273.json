Heroes have levels, skills and can pick up items. To attract heroes, you will need to have at least one of 5 facilities. Will you build your defense out of Rangers, Warriors,\u00a0Wizards, Clerics or Merchants?</p>\n<p>Start by spending your Lumber on the Facilities you want, then roll for your initial pick of Heroes. You get new options every round, and get 1 Lumber after clearing a wave to upgrade your Facilities.<br/><br/><strong>Controls<br/></strong>WASD/Arrows/Middle Mouse Drag - Pan Camera<br/>Left\u00a0Mouse - Click/Select<br/>Right Mouse -\u00a0Cancel/Deselect<br/>Hold Q - Speed Up<br/>R - Restart<br/>Esc - Quit</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T03:12:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/597/5978b608c118ba5e08b11612957ecc19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neopolis"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
