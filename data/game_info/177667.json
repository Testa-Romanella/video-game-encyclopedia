This game was a part of Game Dev Knight's Valentines GameJam. With the jam theme of Togetherness, we created a co-op platformer based around launching your partner to normally unreachable platforms so they can then lift you up to meet them. In the game, you play as a pair of robots as they explore the ruins of an old tower, moving ever upwards towards the sunlight at the top. The idea is to be constantly raising your partner up, and they will do the same for you. Share a keyboard with your partner and get climbing!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Keyboard:\u00a0</p><p>Player 1: WASD, Q, E</p><p>Player 2: Arrow keys, CTRL, Enter</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Christopher Hedley - Designer/Graphics</p>\n<p>Bailey Waldorf - Designer/Graphics</p>\n<p>Dominic Mercado - Sound/Level Designer</p>\n<p>James Williamson - Developer</p>\n<p>Josh Sylvestre - Developer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e78/e785401968287da31f1f69ad7d1cd72e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mercadod94", "RisingGame"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
