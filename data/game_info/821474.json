This year's theme was \"Roll the Dice\" and suspecting a lot of strategy games about probability, I decided to try to go in a more action/fast-paced direction. Rumble Tumble Dice is a game about racing a die around a race track but the speed of the die is determined by what the die rolls. The player is able to remove bad rolls every so often, but also needs to focus on the core racing game play.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the game and let me know what you think!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T08:55:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f54/f5442377cd6ec40be24b034e2575f137.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LemonProphet"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
