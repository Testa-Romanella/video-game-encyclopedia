But one day, you are rudely awakened as your home shakes violently and thunderous noises come from above!</p>\n<p>Cautiously climbing to the surface, you peer outside and see that some of those strange \"humans\" have tilled the land and built a fence around the top of your home. But it gets worse; as you survey the damage, you see that you have other uninvited guests: POTATOES, who shoot orbs of stored sunlight; BEETS, who show off their strength by hurling boulders; and CARROTS, who recklessly launch themselves like missiles.\r\n</p>\n<p>But you are not defenseless. After all, you are a mandragora (sometimes called \"mandrake\") and you are famously dangerous when uprooted. Your paralyzing scream is as potent as ever, and today you will show these interlopers their folly!\r\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Design and UI by Zereijin.<br/>Art, sound, and music by FydaTECH.<br/>Programming by Hawk777.<br/></p>\n<p>Tools used:</p>\n<ul><li>Godot Engine v4 beta 17</li><li>FL Studio 21 (additional VSTs:\u00a0YMCK Magical 8bit plug2, Feldspar)</li><li>Inkscape 1.2.2</li><li>The GIMP 2.10.32</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:14:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/488/488eef5fa7004424276a5833743d1fea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Fyda", "Hawk777", "Zereijin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
