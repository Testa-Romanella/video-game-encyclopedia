{"id": 13504, "slug": "eldritch", "name": "Eldritch", "name_original": "Eldritch", "description": "<p>Eldritch is a 2013 FPS indie game developed by Minor Key Games. Its source code was released to the public by the developers in December 2013.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game&#39;s story is revealed through various books scattered across the levels. The game&#39;s protagonist is a librarian, who explores the worlds of these books as they drag him in. The game is heavily inspired by the myths of Cthulhu and the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game features numerous roguelike elements, as the world is procedurally generated and the permanent death is implemented as well. This adds to the game&#39;s replay value. If the player dies, they lose all the items they had on them as well as their money. Money can be stored in the bank, that is located in the game&#39;s hub environment called the Library. </p>\n<p>The game&#39;s protagonist can use both firearms and magic spells. It is essential to mix all kinds of such weaponry to succeed in the game. Daggers, pickaxes, hatchets, revolvers, and even rocks can be used in the game&#39;s combat.</p>\n<p>Upon completing all the books, the New Game+ mode is unlocked. In this mode, the number of enemies on the level grows drastically, the amount of damage the players can sustain is dropped severely, and several weapons change their behavior. For example, the dagger can deal only a single damage point, and it cannot be used to break doors, rendering it completely useless.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2013-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-14T09:35:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f8eb14ce51250a30bc4ee10a40e859.jpg", "website": "http://www.eldritchgame.com", "rating": 3.45, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 55, "owned": 936, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 51, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 75, "suggestions_count": 333, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 78, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["Minor Key Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Minor Key Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
