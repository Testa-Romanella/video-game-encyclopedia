With easy controls, interesting maps, power-ups and original music, this game is the first release from Scribbly Sherbet Studios.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Play:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Keyboard and/or Controller</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Menu Select - Spacebar\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 1 (Green):\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>\tFire - W\r\n</li><li>\tTurn: A, D\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2 (Pink):</p>\n<ul><li>\tFire - Up Arrow\r\n</li><li>\tTurn: Left Arrow, Right Arrow\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 3 (Orange): (WITH NUM LOCK ON)</p>\n<ul><li>\tFire: Number pad 5\r\n</li><li>\tTurn: Number pad 1, Number pad 3\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 4 (Blue):</p>\n<ul><li>\tFire: I\r\n</li><li>\tTurn: J, L\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Controller: (XBOX)</p>\n<ul><li>Fire: A/RT\r\n</li><li>Turn: Left analog stick\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Normal Mode:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Learn the controls by reading the control menu. Set up the players and press NORMAL to start. Every game has a random map. Fly around the map and chase your opponents. Press your fire button to attack. It\u2019s every dragon for themself! Every round has power-ups chosen at random out of speed, shield, rapid fire, and dragon war. Power-ups appear as orbs with wings. Fly into these to use them. If you are the last dragon alive at the end of the round, you get a point. The first dragon to 5 points is the winner!\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team Mode:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Choose your teams: Team 1 (red), or Team 2 (green). Once you have chosen your team, press START. Look for the coloured number beside each dragon. This tells you what team that dragon is in. Work with your teammate(s) to defeat the dragons from the opposing team. The rest of the game works the same as Normal Mode.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Power-ups:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Power-ups are chosen at random every round. Fly into one to use it! Occasionally, there will be a round with double the amount of power-ups, or a round with even more!</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Speed: This appears as a yellow orb with green wings. It makes your wings golden and gives you a golden trail. This power-up makes you fly faster and turn easier!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Shield: This appears as a purple orb with yellow wings. It gives you a purple bubble around your dragon. This power-up gives you an extra life!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Rapid Fire: This appears as a pink orb with red wings. It gives you red horns and a flaming tail tip. This power-up makes you shoot rapidly and increases the distance of your fire! But it also makes you slower and makes it harder to turn.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Dragon War: This appears as 3 orbs (green, pink and blue) flying together with orange wings. This power-up gives you two more dragons which you also control using the same buttons as usual. Get another dragon war with 4 players, and there\u2019ll be chaos!</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Maps:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>Maps are chosen at random every game.</em>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Twinkling Night: A night sky full of twinkling stars. A basic map, good for beginners.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Dragon Cavern: A dark cave with rocky walls. Fly into the walls and bounce back. A simple map, good for all players.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Cheerful Clouds: A dull sky with moving clouds. Hide behind the brightest clouds. A simple map, good for all players.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Storm of Peril: A perilous storm full of lightning. Get out of the flashing clouds before they turn black and zap you! A more difficult map, good for players who want a challenge.\r\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Frosty Storm: A snowy sky with powerful winds. Don\u2019t fight against the icy gusts! Follow the wind to move faster. After every wave, there are a few seconds of calm before the next storm. A more difficult map, good for players who want a challenge.\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T07:03:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf0/cf0eeaa53553830e56813b738f6b7bad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scribbly Sherbet Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
