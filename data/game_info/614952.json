Embark on more ambitious tasks, restore biodiversity, fix the climate, introduce wildlife, and finally recycle all the structures you used to get there, leaving the environment pristine.<br />\nUnique, procedurally generated maps<br />\nEach region of the game has its own flavour and procedural generation palette. Yet even within a region, no two playthroughs will be the same.<br />\nPicturesque landscapes<br />\nNavigate sprawling, verdant, hand-painted environments where everything but the rocks move and breathe. A meditative soundtrack and stunning audio palette will accompany your efforts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-17T13:49:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91d/91d1068d4c8e55019375562ada13a619.jpg", "website": "https://freelives.net/", "rating": 3.78, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 17, "owned": 50, "beaten": 31, "toplay": 78, "dropped": 36, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 59, "suggestions_count": 196, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 59, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "Linux", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["Free Lives", "Netflix"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Devolver Digital", "Netflix"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
