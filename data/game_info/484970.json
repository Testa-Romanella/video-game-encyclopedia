Or at least live long enough to see what happens.<br />\nGAMEPLAY<br />\nAerial_Knight&#39;s Never Yield is a 3D side-scroller that plays much like a classic endless runner. The game has an interesting story that keeps players always in motion. Run, Jump, Slide or &quot;Dash&quot; for acrobatic variants leading to dope combinations and avoid the challenges that await. Aerial_Knight&#39;s Never Yield is being built for players who love to speedrun games while being an experience that casual players will enjoy as well.<br />\nSOUNDTRACK<br />\nThis Soundtrack for Aerial_Knight&#39;s Never Yield is being done by &quot;Danime-Sama&quot; A Detroit artist with vocals from black artists from all over the world.<br />\nNOTES<br />\nThe Game is currently in development by basically just myself with a lot of help from some of my amazing friends when I need it. This is a passion project of mine and I hope you all enjoy it when its out.
