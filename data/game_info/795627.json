To collect them, you can send a brawler on a card to claim it. You can win the card if you manage to claim it twice, this is called a double capture, but if an enemy claim it with you, you will have to face him in a mini-game. There are three mini-games:</p>\n<p>- Clicker (the faster you click, the faster you will win)</p>\n<p>- Rub (the goal is to rub a surface without getting out)</p>\n<p>- Collect (the goal is to catch the same figure as your brawler's type)</p>\n<p>The winner is the one with the most remaining power. Cards also increase brawler\u00a0power per type. Furthermore, they have an additional effect. The Gold Card doubles the bonus power if your brawler is the same as the card name, the Silver Card does nothing, and the Bronze Card swaps your power with the enemy power.</p>\n<p>Warning:\u00a0 there is the presence of affinity between brawler's types.</p>\n<p>I hope to see your feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T07:01:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc07447cd0ecb2afbbd14d0ac1183e70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Westerbay"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
