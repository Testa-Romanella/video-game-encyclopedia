As of now, the plan is to recreate the game as original as possible, yet with many new changes and upgrades. I'm using Game Maker for this, and I don't know much coding so it's all going to be drag-and-drop (nevermind, there's some coding). I'm interested to see what I can do with this, so we'll see how far I can get.</p>\n<p>I am currently in college, so the process of this game is going to be very long and dragged out, and I may not ever finish it, but this is something I want to try. I\u00a0thought I\u00a0would post this here mainly for my own documentation purposes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:46:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25b/25b2a62040000aea11d2772adf6275c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["clopenz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
