Luckily, someone left you some clues to help you find the end of this endless loop and move on. You also have to dodge the blue boxes (supposed to be cars but had no time to finish).</p>\n<p>Jump = Space Down arrow = confirm the end of the loop</p>\n<p>Currently only has two levels, not much UI! If you lose, the game will keep looping as well so you have to refresh the browser to play again!
