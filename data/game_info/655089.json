This is just a prototype I made to explore Unreal C++. It is very unfinished, so be ready for things such as the game starting as soon as it loads!\u00a0While I 100% plan to put this game on my shelf and revisit it someday, I definitely need to take a break from Unreal Engine.\u00a0That being said, I still think the game is pretty fun! Might be worth checking out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>In game, your team is labelled player one, where you got your AI buddy against two AI opponents. The AI is programmed to dynamically switch between offensive and defensive positions, depending on how close each teammate is to the ball and their own goal. Be sure to keep positioning in mind to utilize your teammate as effectively as possible! Do you want to let them handle offense as you move back to prepare to counter an opponents shot?\u00a0Or do you just want to go in, letting them handle goalie duties?\u00a0Either way, the most effective way to play is to take advantage of your partner to succeed!</p>\n<p>Your \"shotgun\"\u00a0(green cone)\u00a0will turn red when it overlaps the ball, signaling that it is okay to shoot. On\u00a0<em>successful shots only</em>, the shotgun will have a 1 second delay before it can be fired again. This rule applies to both you and your opponents, so keep that in mind as you keep track of their movements!</p>\n<p>First player to 5 goals wins!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement<br/>Mouse:\u00a0Aim<br/>Left Click: Shoot<br/>Space: Jump<br/>Esc: Close Game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T15:43:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe70f3e2b7e2c2fca18736395432130d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShinyOlivia"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
