Snake God won't stand for that! Can you crush the opposing game pieces before they crush you?</p>\n<p><em>BGBG</em> features endless generated stages, weird classic enemies, and fantastic power-ups. But it's a roll of the dice whether you'll get to use them to their full advantage...<br/></p>\r\nFAQ\r\n<p><strong><strong>Q:\u00a0</strong></strong>What is going on please\u00a0he\u00a0lp</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> You control a die and you can roll yourself to attack. You'll use the equipment mapped to the side you land on. You can buy new items from the pedestals, and you get money by breaking pots and defeating enemies. See if you can get an interesting combo with your equipment! We really like Stunt Doubler.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Ok but how do I win</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Collect all the keys in the level and head to the door to advance onward. See how far you get before you die.<br/>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why don't the little ships do anything? What's up with that?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> They're supposed to drop pegs on the board like Battleship, but they're having skill issues. Sorry!</p>\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> There are pieces stuck off the board/on a floating island.</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> They are having skill issues as well. Sorry!</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why doesn't the shockwave animation always play?</p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We were having skill issues too. Sorry!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Isn't this basically the same thing you did last year, where you take the prompt stupidly literally?<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A: </strong>Aren't you the same thing you were last year? Ever think about that?\u00a0<br/></p>\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nWASDMovement\r\nSpaceRoll\r\nEInteract with pedestal when near (alternatively, bump into it)<br/>\r\nTabCheck equipment\r\nClick/EnterAdvance cutscene\r\n\r\nCredits\u00a0\r\n\r\nProgrammingCadence, Janjan, Joseppey, minimus, MNIK, RNL, Torin <br/>ArtCadence (cutscene, scenery), Chai-Kai (enemies), CookieCyclone (icons, scenery, enemies)<br/>\r\nMusic<br/>Janjan, Yuv<br/>\r\nVoice Acting<br/>Cadence (Chaos God), Chai-kai (Snake God)<br/>\r\nPage Setup<br/>Cadence, Janjan, minimus<br/>\r\nConcept<br/>all of the above \ud83d\ude0f<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T07:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2b/c2b505e97500c43f645634e5524af449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["janjan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
