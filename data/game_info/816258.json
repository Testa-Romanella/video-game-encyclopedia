I created this game just cuz I was bored lol, anyways I hope you enjoy.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Bobby Mcnally, age 26. Was walking down a trail in the woods one day with his wife and 2 kids. As they set up camp he decided to go on a trip to the store to grab some food because they forgot to buy some. On Bobby's way to the car he finds something lodged in one of the tree stumps. He grabbed it and to his surprise it was a VHS tape, he went to the store to buy a VHS and to his luck he found one. He went back to the camp and he and his family watched the tape.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Controls -\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>WASD\r\n</p>\n<p>Run - Shift\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Links -\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7rWs8AN7RmMxjPdIZKlpOg\r\n</p>\n<p>Twitch:\u00a0https://twitch.tv/allarotv\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/jVWfW6JFfG\u00a0\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credit:\r\n</p>\n<p>SANDRO T - Unity Asset Store Map\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-11T11:37:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a5/8a5b853724e019f197d509e6df0d3052.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Allaro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
