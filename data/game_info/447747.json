He needs to get to the other side of the level. Why? I don't know. I made this in a week, cut me some slack.</p>\n<p>Anyways, this would be pretty easy, but Tim can only jump twice before his legs are too weak to let him jump again. Luckily, he can defy the laws of physics and jump in mid-air, which is convenient. That still won't get him too far, though. Tim thought ahead, though. He called up his friend, who placed a whole lot of jump refreshers around the level, which magically heal Tim's legs back to full energy.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of easter eggs hidden around the game, see how many you can find.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T05:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/707/70786be1807165ab3a6b0240974dd0e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Afely"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
