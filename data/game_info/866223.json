Story:\u00a0</strong>The game sets in the beautiful<strong>\u00a0city of Lahore in a cute cartoony style</strong>, where the essence of its beauty is effectively captured. In this game, three friends are competing with each other to onboard the train to reach Jinnah Express Station, Lahore. The train has only two empty slots, hence one out of the three friends is bound to lose. During the race, every individual has to be nitpicky and careful about the obstacles such as\u00a0<strong>Trucks, Rickshaws, and Cars</strong>. They also need to stop at a red signal and continue to run when the signal is green. To increase the speed, the game also provides them with the feasibility to hop onto roller skates for maximum efficiency. If the player reaches the train in time, he wins.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.
