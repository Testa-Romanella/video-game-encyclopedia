Ship your zombies around the world to avoid them overrunning your HQ and gain cash you can spend on researching a cure. But if you send too many to a region they'll eliminate the human population! More zombies will spawn in your HQ as you further your research, but each research step also decreases the zombie population in all the regions. Win the game by researching all 4 stages for a cure without your HQ or the entire world being devoured by zombie animals!</p><p>Made as part of Train Jam 2017!<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/></p><p>Programmer, Designer - Arvind Raja Yadav</p><p>Designer - Steve Emberton</p><p>Programmer - Seth Anderson</p><p>Art - Charlie McCarron</p><p>Music &amp; Sound - Bettina Calmon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9f/c9f4f302375a5cab4e54595e3e10a037.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["steveembr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
