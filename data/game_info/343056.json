She recovered the deer and returned it to the forest.\u00a0<br/>One day, the forest and their wolves started getting more hostile, so Samantha went to the forest to save her pet deer from the big bad wolf.</p>\n<p>The game's already in a playable state, but it's not having the details to consider it a released build.
