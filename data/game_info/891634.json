This project is a personal effort that has been planned for some time. It's a short story of lesbian romance and adventure, which I always thought was a really fun combination.

Her life seemed like a paradise, until the day her beloved suddenly asked for them to breakup, without an explanation. As if that weren't bad enough, she was immediately afflicted with a terrible illness that left her comatose.</em></p>\n<p><em>Without a second thought, Shira sets out on a journey deep into the heart of the forest in search of her mysterious teacher Loic - and her estranged sister, the tyrant of flames. Along the way, she will be able to count on the help of her dear but cowardly friend Luka, as well as a powerful and daring rival named Jareth. Her goal is to find answers, a cure for Laren, and if possible, a way to mend their relationship in the process.</em></p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><em><strong>Others:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Luka</strong>, Laren's brother;</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Loic</strong></em>, professor at the academy of magic;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Thaltra</strong>, Shira's sister and Loic's wife;</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Phia</strong>, Shira's niece and Loic's daughter;</em></p>\n<br/>\n<p><em>- 30k words of story;</em></p>\n<p><em>- Story with choices that affect how it unfolds later on;</em></p>\n<p><em>- Characters with unique personalities and motivations;</em></p>\n<p><em>- A narrative that mixes romance and fantasy adventure;</em></p>\n<p><em>- Multiple endings;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Screenplay, artwork and development: B.G.
