To do that, you must fill all 4 bars (Game Design, Programming, Art and Sound <em>(last one is certainly ironic considering this game's soundscape)</em>). Each developer you take on the team add points to the bars every couple of seconds (that's <em>Delay </em>stat). You can review each dev's stats on the <em>Team\u00a0</em>screen.</p>\n<p>How do you hire new people then? From the same\u00a0<em>Team\u00a0</em>screen. Just pick the devs you like from the list of available people and click them. This list refreshes every once in a while.</p>\n<p>Now, making indie games for free for prolonged periods of time leads to the loss of focus and <em>Boredom.\u00a0</em>That's the grey bar on top of the bars. Every time it fills -- a developer you hired leaves the project. If you don't have any more people on the team and you yourself get bored -- that's Game Over.</p>\n<p>So, how do you prevent it? Change the project over at the <em>Project\u00a0</em>screen, of course. Add new features, change name, genre or theme -- go nuts. But, obviously, overhauling the project half way through comes at a great <em>(well, -ish)</em> cost. You lose some of the points you already accumulated.</p>\n<p>Some people on your team come with free money. Go over to the <em>Store </em>and spend it on assets to boost your bars and\u00a0alleviate some boredom.</p>\n<p>As your project comes to an end (successfully or not) you will be shown a log of story of your game's development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that I'm writing this, I realize that you kinda have to Alt+F4 out of the game to start over, but it's a bit late to change things, huh.</p>\n<p>Anyway, really hope you enjoy it. Leave some feedback if you feel like it (you might not even realize how valuable this stuff really is), rate it on Ludum Dare site and thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T09:33:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45d/45d17ee81451b3c582700e20fe8cc1f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Apple Dash"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
