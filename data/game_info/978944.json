Your life depends on it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe book starts out as as a weak projectile, but with the power of adding pages with upgrades written on them, the book can change and morph into what is needed. Upgrades range drastically with some playing a more supportive role such as a laser sight or a more offensive role, like changing your projectiles into knives.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNew pages can also be written by finding ink during runs. These pages can be written before a run starts to have a chance of dropping during the next run.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEscape The Hell Inside", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T10:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ab/4ab89f33b7c606a22486b45dd3c57d26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GingersoftGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["GingersoftGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
