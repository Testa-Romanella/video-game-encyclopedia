In the game you are a cloud who has fallen in love with a flower. However, you're bound to the sky and float upwards when objects are not directly above you. You complete 5 puzzles of increasing complexity, in your attempt to be reunited with your love.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>More of Jack's Work:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rxu8CvYXhfgDGjrXaagbpBXukpI98xzn</p>\n<p>Featuring royalty free music by:</p>\n<p>Kevin Macleod:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSZXFhRIx6b0dFX3xS8L1yQ</p>\n<p>Heatley\u00a0Bros:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsLlqLIE-TqDq3lh5kU2PeA</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T09:18:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2e/e2e859519c48a4366573188edc5aabfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MarcusDevelopment"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
