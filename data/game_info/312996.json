This can make things a bit tricky.<br/>If you have enough spare balls, you can launch some extra ones!</p>\n<p>=== GAME CONTROLS ===<br/><strong>PADDLE MOVEMENT</strong>-&gt; Arrow Keys<br/><strong>LAUNCH A BALL</strong> -&gt; Spacebar<br/><strong>CHANGE SELECTED BALL TYPE</strong> -&gt; TAB<br/><strong>EXIT GAME</strong> -&gt; ESCAPE</p>\n<p>Move off-screen to change between areas.</p>\n<p>If you're on the screen with a door in the cliff, press UP to enter it (That's the shop).<br/>To choose an item, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys, and press SPACE to select.<br/>To leave the shop, press DOWN.</p>\n<p>Thank you for trying this game out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T04:17:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/835/8353dc5b4fe1b67e4b5bb1d3d7aa4548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["64Mega"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
