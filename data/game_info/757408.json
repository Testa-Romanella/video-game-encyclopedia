{"id": 757408, "slug": "total-duel", "name": "Total Duel", "name_original": "Total Duel", "description": "<p>\"Total Duel\" is a fun local-multiplayer fencing game, where the goal is to destroy the enemy player. When the two swords collide, the game enters into a slow-mo state, where the players can move their weapons normally, but the characters' movement is slowed down. If someone eliminates the enemy player, they get a point, and the first one to reach five points wins.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>Red player (Mouse and Keyboard):</p>\n<ul><li>A- Move left</li><li>D-Move right</li><li>G-Extend/Retract weapon</li><li>Mouse-Rotate weapon</li><li>Space-Jump</li></ul>\n<p>Blue player (Controller):</p>\n<ul><li>Left stick-Move player left/right</li><li>Left button-Extend/Retract weapon</li><li>Right stick-Rotate weapon</li><li>Right trigger-Jump</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T09:26:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/275/2753174eaa07dd96d04d644b6058eb1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RandomPirate774"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
