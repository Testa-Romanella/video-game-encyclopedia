The game also features several roguelike elements.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows several heroes that descend into the dungeons of a 19th century Chile city of Santiago to find a warlock, whose dreams wreck havoc on the streets of a South American town.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>In its gameplay, Abyss Odyssey fuses several genres into one, creating something absolutely new. The players control a character, whose main objective is to complete procedurally generated levels without dying and killing as many monsters as they can on the way to the exit from the level. The implementation of procedural generation results in a high degree of replayability as no level will play out the same.</p>\n<p>Due to the infusion of roguelike elements to the game, the players only have one life. Upon death, the players are given a weaker character to play as. This new character sets out to avenge the death of a previous one. It is possible to revive your dead character by finding them and using a special alter that has to be found somewhere on the level. </p>\n<p>The game&#39;s combat is heavily inspired by several Japanese fighting games. The players are awarded new loot upon timing their moves correctly. </p>\n<p>Abyss Odyssey features a unique level unlock system, that is driven by the community. On the game&#39;s release, only the first act was available for playing. The next ones were unlocked upon a certain number of players beating the game&#39;s bosses.</p>", "metacritic": 69, "released": "2014-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-17T22:44:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/186/186641799044a7daa32d2845d354758a.jpg", "website": "http://www.abyssodyssey.com", "rating": 2.78, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 69, "owned": 944, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 38, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 67, "suggestions_count": 571, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 68, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["ACE Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
