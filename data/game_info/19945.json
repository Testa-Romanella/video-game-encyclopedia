You can break the coins and directly strike in the opponent's box, but as you are far from it, will be more difficult to score. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen playing the defense turn, try to stop the opponent' strikes by moving your middle finger. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first player who scores 5 times wins the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T13:40:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81d866fcfd3fa1400f963004f1eb83ca.jpg", "website": "http://www.89amstudio.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 95, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89AM Studio"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["89AM Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
