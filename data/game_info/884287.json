Boarding their ship, they sail across a small series of islands,\u00a0fighting several foes along the way (And perhaps finding a secret island) before being tracked down by none other than the Governer of the local islands, a dangerous foe. With the fall of the Governer, the crew may rest easy, if temporarily. However, the fall of the Governer may not be one the enemy takes lightly...<br/></p>\n<p>This Demo covers a prototype of the game, including the map, fights and character dialogue\u00a0until the first, early, boss fight.<br/><br/>Release date TBD, likely 9th December.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Character profiles made on:\u00a0http://dmheroes.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T14:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7aa/7aa55ee4926ef0d387124904c52f7799.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Airborne Cow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
