The goal is be \"out of controls\" in the same way you could be \"out of ammo\".</p>\n<p>This was combined with the story idea of being in a City that acts as an embodiment of the concept of Control. The further out of the City center you get, the less control you have.</p>\n\n<p>Learned lots making this; Hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>There are some things missing\u00a0in the GameJame version; didn't have time to do a last art pass so walls are all \"minimalist\" and by the half way point, room names get a bit \"over-consistent\" :D</p><p>Also, sprites for ducking... and a half dozen levels from near the end...</p>\n<p>May do a polish pass and release a newer version; but for now taking a break ^_^</p>\n<p>---<br/></p>\n<p>The soundtrack for the game was made by me and is available here:</p>\n<ul><li>https://xefortanzo.bandcamp.com/album/out-of-control-ost</li></ul>\n<p>Massive thanks to the following artists\u00a0for art assets used in game.</p>\n<ul><li>https://edermunizz.itch.io/infinite-runner</li><li>https://hyohnoo.itch.io/keyboard-controller-keys</li><li>https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-gold</li><li>https://s4m-ur4i.itch.io/huge-pixelart-asset-pack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:54:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/567/567a31fe12f1bfb180a4f07bbec0818c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Xefortanzo"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
