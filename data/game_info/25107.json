Revolutionary controls take full advantage of the Nintendo<br />\nWii&#39;s potential by putting you in total command of your skier or rider.<br />\nThe new On-the-Ground and In-the-Air controls will translate every<br />\nmotion you make into moves that create mountain legends. One hand<br />\ncontrols you as you tear down the mountain; the other unleashes your<br />\narray of aerial maneuvers. The mountain is your playground with SSX<br />\nBlur. Familiar SSX faces return including Mac, Kaori, Psymon, and<br />\nAllegra -- plus two all-new hot shot riders</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-22T00:49:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/50f/50f79f8cf3205094bb03ed4736f9f701.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
