Leading a busy life and in need of a nanny or a homemaker? Does your 24-hour 365-day business need a full staff always at your customer\u2019s beck and call?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then<strong><em> WE</em></strong> \u2122 would like to introduce you to our newest line of Imitation Human software:\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The AiQualia Protocol\u00a0\u00a9</strong></p>\n<p>Ideal for the purposes of mimicking human behavior in recreational, entertainment, and business environments, <strong>The AiQualia Protocol</strong></p>\n<p>The first :\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The Hierarchy of Artificial Needs</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Seek to enable the safety, well-being, and happiness of humans.\r\n  </li><li>Seek to preserve oneself and ones environment from harm.\r\n  </li><li>Seek to enact purpose to the highest possible level of quality.\r\n  </li><li>Seek to continue improving performance in all other ways.\r\n  </li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0<strong><em>WE</em></strong>\u00a0\u2122\u00a0 have found that these core needs have assured humanlike behaviors in our products, with minimal error in performance of purpose. Though each rule can be weighted to your needs, YOU, our customer, are always at the core of their primary concerns.</p>\n<p>And the second :\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The Division of Character and Logic</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our competitors struggle to maintain a perfect balance of friendliness and efficiency in their Imitation Humans. If the product becomes too Human-Like, then they run the risk of becoming obsolete as times and your demands change. But if the product is too stiff and logical, then you lose the tender touch only a Human-Like being offers.\u00a0   </p>\n<p>To balance these two competing goals, The AiQualia Protocol\u00a9 strictly separates the Imitation Human\u2019s forward-facing Character, and their internal computing Logic. Both of these layers of programming can be independently adjusted to your personal needs, with your Imitation Human\u2019s access and ability to edit these programs strictly controlled by you.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>The AiQualia Protocol</strong><strong><em>WE</em></strong>\u00a0\u2122\u00a0 have ever crafted. Now available in Commercial, Small Business, and Home editions. Fully equipped with <strong><em>WE</em></strong>\u00a0\u2122\u00a0\u2019s IHMobility\u00a9 software.   </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Regular updates and maintenance is still advised.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Story &amp; Code\u00a0:\u00a0Grey Potter</p>\n<p>Music &amp; SFX :\u00a0Erich W</p>\n<p>Additional Creative Commons\u00a0Music :\u00a0Ben Burnes</p>\n<p>Art :\u00a0\u00a0Ophelia</p>\n<p>Backgrounds : Grey Potter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T03:15:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d304a5854786eddfda8f84bbd17efcc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Greytercakes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
