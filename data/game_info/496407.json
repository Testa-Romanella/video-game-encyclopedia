I made it with Godot engine. You can play it with your friend on a local network, or you can download Hamachi and play with anyone. The game is a 1v1 tank game with ricocheable projectiles. It is five rounds to win and one round is 60 seconds. There is also pickable power ups. (Understand that the game has most probably some bugs. Not tested on Linux/GNU)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2d/c2df86b70a62976339981f2d1a7e6055.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EGE00"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
