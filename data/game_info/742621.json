After receiving a request to cure a sick child, they are wrapped in an adventure that spans the whole magical land!</p>\n<p>Delia: The Traveling Witch is an Action Platformer with lots of talking NPC's and locations to learn about. It will eventually have elements of Schmup gameplay as well.</p>\n<p>This game is being built over the course of 10 weeks and has an expected finish date in Early April. It is being built within GBStudio, and through a solo game developer, Kaimatten.</p>\n<p>Currently the game is V.1 - there is only 1 level: somewhere between 5-10 minutes of content. It can be played in Browser or by downloading the Rom, however there are some color issues between the two.</p><p>The game is made to be built for a Gameboy, and thus has all the limitations of a Gameboy Color.
