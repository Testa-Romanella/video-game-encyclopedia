Due to the lack of time and the denial of some scope creep there are only two. Firstly, the AirGun. using the arrow keys to shoot in any direction causes a burst of air to fire out this has a lot of recoil and when shot down can be used as a double jump. Second and finally, the HandGun/blaster (idk the name) shooting it in any direction causes a hand to shoot out, whos hand? I don't know that either but when shooting it at a switch it'll flip the switch!<br/></p>\n<p>All of the art\u00a0sound effects, and most of the code were made by yours truly. The music was made by Tim Beek and is from their\u00a0dystopian\u00a0pack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T19:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/90706920cb40de66c1fd8b341b98c38e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Toast Studio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
