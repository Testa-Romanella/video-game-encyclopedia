The project was successfully funded through Kickstarter last year and is currently being polished for a future release. The game is awesome and I wanted to make my own take by turning their stunning environment into pixel art.</p><p>This prototype level was about testing some new Unity and C# concepts and writing comprehensive code. I used some intermediate material such as event delegates, coroutines, interfaces, extensions and even some plug-ins (InControl for usb controllers).</p><p>*Please note that all sound assets are from the Unity Store, the artistic direction comes from the game Lightfall and is copywrited, I received approval from the team to use their world with a twist. This is a school project, the prototype is only for personal use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/820/820d69877b094c75266ddaeefe63286c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["alxnstv"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
