From your corporate orbital platform, launch more satellites than the other companies and establish dominance!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be careful, though - satellites can collide!\u00a0Debris and satellites impacting Planet Florida will eventually destroy the planet, ending the game. Have the most satellites flying when the world explodes to win!</p>\n<p>Game is played using a controller, use the left stick to aim your satellite slingshot, and press and hold A to adjust launch power.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is inspired by the real-life traffic jam in space, where satellites and debris are in danger of colliding every day. \u00a0Space debris is a real issue as space becomes more commercialized, this is our little attempt to have some fun and call attention at the same time.\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris</p>\n\n<p>Contributors include:<br/></p>\n<p>Emilio Alban - Unity Programming</p>\n<p>Joe Peaden\u00a0- Unity Programming</p>\n<p>Mike Bianchini\u00a0- Unity Programming and art</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Duffy\u00a0- 2D Art</p>\n<p>Chris Duffy - Rocket Science and Play Testing</p>\n<p>Brian Luft - Incredible Audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-30T04:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bf/4bfc4a5dd712cdc79639fc2425e4b0fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chrislg"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
