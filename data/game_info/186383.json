I have taken the little red riding hood and placed her into a platform game. Simple W, A, D controls to move and jump I have added an extra move which allows the player to dash. Now the dash allows players to evade and avoid the moving enemies. The closer you get to the enemy they start to move faster, having the dash gives you the opportunity to escape before you die. As you around avoiding enemies and searching for the exit portal you have to collect all of the jewels placed in each room before the portal is activated and can be used.  </p><p>Key features:</p><p>-Awesome dashing ability </p><p> -Crazy enemy chase <br/></p><p>-Crazy levels</p><p>-Easy controls</p><p>-Free</p><p>Contact: </p><p>Marino Gardiner </p><p>Email: marinogardiner@gmail.com</p><p>Release:</p><p>June 26 2015</p><p>Available:</p><p>Little Red is available on PC</p><p>Price:</p><p>FREE!!! </p><p>Because everything is better when it's free!!! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/165/1655b935c6381452e55ccb11cee4ef21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mgard134"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
