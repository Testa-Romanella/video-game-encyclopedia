{"id": 601455, "slug": "blueberry-in-space", "name": "Blueberry In Space", "name_original": "Blueberry In Space", "description": "<p>Blueberry in\u00a0Space is a game about a tiny little blueberry named Boop in an unfortunate situation.</p>\n<p>On return to her home planet of Booptomium after several months of doing whatever it is tiny armless orbs do in space, Boop was told that she should could not re-enter due to the concentration of Cookies on her space station. The sleazy docking operator and Boop both know that cookies have no effect on the ship, but he still wants her to collect all of them so he can take them when she docks.</p>\n<p>Miffed but with no options, Boop must brave the outside area of the space station while being shot at and rammed into by killer life forms, as well as spikes.</p>\n<p>Estimated playtime: 10-12 minutes, depending on how epic of a gamer you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left and right arrow keys to move</li><li>Z to jump and use the menu</li><li>C to superjump. You'll go straight up using this and will continue until you hit a ceiling. Be careful, though -- you can't move left or right while superjumping and won't regain control until you hit a ceiling.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Asides and Special Thanks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Blueberry in Space is my first forray into the world of game development.
