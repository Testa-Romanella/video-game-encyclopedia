Watch for your oxygen and fuel so you don't end up stranded or dead.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Walk Forward/Back, Left/Right</p>\n<p>Left/Right + Forward/Back will rotate the character</p>\n<p>Space - Jetpack</p>\n<p>Q/E - Roll (When far enough from a planet)</p>\n<p>R - Head-mount Camera (Useful for lining up with the other planet, will also open while using jetpack.)</p>\n<p>Escape - Back to menu</p>\n<p>Information:</p>\n<p>You win if you successfully collect 40 of each material. Crystals will add more jetpack fuel, and there is only oxygen on the starting planet. If you run out of oxygen, you \"die\" and are unable to continue. The timer and points are there only to see how fast you can run through the game.\u00a0Also, the Sun has gravity. It unfortunately does not kill you in this build, but it was planned.</p>\n\n<p>As for judging, audio wasn't implemented in time for the 9\u00a0Day Game Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-14T05:10:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/267/26707c1a8ed6042e45dac80b2d25e1a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ExcelFX"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
