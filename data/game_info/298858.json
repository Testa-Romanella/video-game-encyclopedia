Prove them wrong.<br/></p>\n<p>Every year people search for OP-sensei, a misterious martial arts expert who lives secluded\u00a0<br/>in his dojo, rarely seeing anyone else. One of those students is you, picked by the master<br/>himself to be trained on the ways of the shuriken. But reward doesn't come without risk.<br/>You must stop the ninja stars OP-sensei throws at you trusting your ears and your own<br/>confidence in that which you perceive. Good luck, youngling.
