After the player acts, all of the enemies on screen will move.<br/></p>\n<p>- The following turn after a player moves from a spot, that spot will turn into a void tile : enemies can't get past them, and the player will take damage for each turn spent on them.<br/></p>\n<p>- The player can collect and use different items. Once you obtained an item, cycle through your inventory with left shift and press c to use it. You then will be prompted the direction in which to use the item. Select it with the arrow keys, and press c to confirm or x to cancel.<br/></p>\n<p>- Items have a certain durability. After using them too many times, they will break and become unusable.</p><p>- You will probably need to reset the room at some point... Press R to do so !<br/></p>\n<p>- There is no penalty for dying, so feel free to experiment !</p><p>Notes</p><p>There are no sounds yet, and very few animations... I apologize for that ! It was my first time using something else than a GUI-based game engine like Godot and Unity, so I had a lot of trouble implementing things that were supposed to be easy to add.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T03:15:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/861adaa1eb7e543022c2b2d1aa317d86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TaliOS"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
