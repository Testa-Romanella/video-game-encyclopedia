To join a lobby, the lobby must be public. If the lobby is not shown, it is suggested to make the lobby invisible then visible, and this will likely fix the problem. If not then the game will need to most likely be restarted.<br/></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to purify the demon. In order to do this, the players will need to find four seals that are placed around the sanctum and destroy them. Once all four correct seals are destroyed, the demon will be purifiable. Be careful, as there are also fake seals. The only way to distinguish which ones are real, is by small differences in the pentagrams drawn\u00a0on the seals.\u00a0Every time a seal is destroyed, the demon will become stronger. So the\u00a0closer the player(s) are to winning, the hard the game gets.</p>\n<p>The demon\u2019s abilities are inspired by weeping angels. When a player is caught, they are turned into stone, and can only be revived through a splash of holy water every player carries within their flasks. However, the players will only receive a limited amount of flasks. These are split between the player(s) at the beginning of the game. The development team did not have enough time to implement the texture, so currently there is no way to tell a player is dead other than calling it out. Once a player is dead, they will be able to spectate their friends if they are alive by click the left and right mouse buttons.</p>\n<p>The primary tactic the players\u00a0can use to avoid being caught is to throw holy water at the demon. This will cause the demon to be teleported to a random location on the map, however, there is a cooldown, meaning this is not a spammable mechanic. This gives a chance for the player(s) to run away, but if it is abused, the player might just find themself in a situation they did not want.</p>\n<p>As there is only a limited amount of holy water available, if it is all consumed, the player(s) will automatically lose the game. This is because at least one holy water will be needed to purify the demon at the end of the game. So, the player(s) will need to manage their resource of Holy Water. Is it worth it to stun? Is it worth it to revive? Is it worth playing more risky or safe? The dynamic difficulty also encourages the player(s) use of holy water as the demon is more likely to catch the player.</p>\n<p>Another tactic is for the players to be more sneaky. The demon has an easier time finding the player the more noise they give off. The demon will also be able to spot players that are in light easier. Players will also be able to hide behind objects. These tactics give the player a higher chance of avoiding being caught.<br/></p>\n<p>Flashlights are the primary light source in the game. The light can be accessed by pressed \"1\",\u00a0however, they\u00a0have a limited battery life, and must be recharged by picking up one of the various batteries lying around the sanctum. There are also torches and candles around the map which have limited up-time that the players can light around the map. They can be litten by pressing the global interaction button\u00a0\"e\" while holding the lighter which is pulled out with the button \"3\".\u00a0This makes it so that the player(s) have an easier time traversing the map with more than one lighting option, but if the game goes on for too long, the players may very well find themselves only using their lighter for the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>There are many seals throughout the map. These seals are placed on altars. Although the altars are on set locations, the real/fake seals are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game, meaning that every play through will be different.\u00a0Every seal of the game will also need player(s) to perform a ritual on the seal, forcing them to stay near the seal for a period of time.\u00a0To perform the ritual, the player will need to hold the global interaction button \"e\" in order to perform a ritual. Each seal is a different object, but every seal will have a pentagram, with fakes having small differences in the pentagrams.\u00a0If all four seals are not destroyed, the demon will not be purifiable, and when holy water is thrown at it, it will be teleported. If all seals are destroyed, then the demon will die when holy water is successfully thrown at it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>Shift - Sprint (stamin bar can be seen up top)\r\n</p>\n<p>CTRL - Crouch\r\n</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>1 - Turn on/off flashlight</p>\n<p>2 - Throw holy water (how much a player has can be seen on the bottom left)</p>\n<p>3 - Pulls out the lighter, automatically lit (players will only be able to light candles/torches when this is pulled out)</p>\n<p>4 - Pulls out a torch if picked up.</p>\n<p>E - Global interaction button.

I was responsible for managing our team, managing the game, contacting the professor / teaching assistant, creating\u00a0the GDD, creating the map with the modular set that Nicole had created, the lighting for the game, creating the player and demon model / animations which I had to end up outsourcing due to time constraints, the post-processing effects of the game, alleviating rendering with things such as occlusion culling to make the game run faster, tuning design parameters of the game's mechanics, creating documents for the group such as the itch.io page, and the cover page used for the game.</em></p>\n<p><em>I had somewhat of a\u00a0bad experience with my first game class, so I had decided to take matters into my own hands and try to be a leader for a group this time. I had spent hours trying to pay attention to what people actually go to class, especially considering it was by zoom as this was during the Covid19 situation, meaning remote learning, and people who took care of their stuff such as changing their nicknames and setting a role to themselves in the discord server we had for this class. I took time doing this as I really wanted to find good groupmates and make somewhat of a real game that I'd like and be proud of. With how our university works, the game classes being a certificate program, programming focus at that, it was definitely easiest to find the programmers. I had to settle on just one artist due to this. The reason why I had no other designers was because I\u00a0felt this was a job I could do myself as producers seemed to be pretty free.</em></p>\n<p><em>What went right for me was for sure the start of the project. I was going dozens of hours dedicated into making/creating the game during the first month. The GDD alone took over 20 hours in total and was 60 page slides of PowerPoint made by Photoshop. I\u00a0also spent a lot of time researching things such as the lighting of Unity and post-processing. I'm not a coder, so I tried to help out with non-code-related things. What went wrong for me was multiple things. One was that I haven't taken over a leader position for something of this scale since middle school, not to mention something more business sided. Although I think the planning / role assignment I did was generally good, there could've been definitely some tweaks which would've been a better order to tackle the development. If I was to redo anything over, it'd be to focus on the player and demon model/animations aspect first instead of focusing on it during the end of the project.</em></p>\n<p><em>I was responsible for making the model / animations for us, but due to other classes and the design/producing side taking too much of my time, it kept getting delayed, and I had to end up opting to buy royalty / credit\u00a0free high-quality character and demon model as I wanted it to look good. There were many changes to the game compared to what was put in the first GDD. This included many of the mechanics, removing a church which we were originally going to use for the spawn, changing the game from multiplayer focus to single-player focus then back to multiplayer, and some tweaks to things that were already coded out. The job allocation I kept giving to people also frequently changed, due to reasons such as getting delayed due to problems or needing to give more as some members were pretty free and some even worked more than what they were given.</em></p>\n<p><em>The biggest problem of our game was the amount of bugs causing the game to crash that appeared during the last week of development. We had to spend many extra hours during the final week in order to prep this game to be playable enough. We also had to make some cuts to meet deadlines, such as incorporating the death/revive animation retexturing. To solve the crashing problem we had to edit much of our code, and even remove one of our mechanics of the game, which was swingable doors similar to that in Phasmophobia.</em></p>\n<p><em>The things I learned most from working on this game were on how to manage a team, design a game better, the Unity lighting system, Post Processing, rendering alleviation, and better time management. The most important thing to me was the managing of a team, as I feel the next project I\u00a0will take up will be much better due to the things I\u00a0had learned from this game.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Nicole Furlage -</em></strong> <em>\"Hello, I was the sole artist on our team. I worked on UI, such as the main menu, won and lost screens, and in-game cursors. I also created all of the 3d models (other than the player model and demon model/animations)\u00a0and particle effects used in the game, as well as all player animations in Blender.</em></p>\n<p><em>I had never done 3d modeling prior to this class so even though the learning curve for figuring out Blender was pretty steep, I was able to create a good number of models and level-building assets for our game in a short amount of time. With the help of an animation library, I found on the Unity asset store, I was also able to create a responsive main menu.</em></p>\n<p><em>My inexperience with Blender became an issue when it came to creating 3d animations for the player. The player had a lot of different states that required different animations. He walks, crouches, runs, and hold items in either hand. While I was able to create these in time by using references online, I only wish I could have made them smoother and more polished for the final build of the game. We had originally planned to have a different model for each of the four players, but this was changed to one model due to time constraints.</em></p>\n<p><em>There were also a few issues importing art assets into Unity. For example, when I imported the modular set for level building into the game, it turned out that the models were scaled way bigger than any of the other assets already present in the project. Also, in 3D modeling, it is possible for some faces of a shape to be facing inward, so that Unity cannot render them properly. These issues were easily resolved by planning ahead when it came to scaling things in Blender, as well as saving and loading models into the game frequently to ensure everything looks right.</em></p>\n<p><em>In general, I learned how to use different programs and the different tools that Unity has at its disposal to impact the look and atmosphere of a game.\"<br/></em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Ariel Gutierrez -</em></strong> <em>\"Hello, I am one of the programmers of this game. I helped\u00a0set up the player cameras,\u00a0 programmed a Phasmophobia styled door, spectator cameras, some\u00a0aspects of the items (flashlight, candles, torches), some of the seal mechanics,\u00a0some of the map decoration, and some odd jobs in coding to help other people in the project.</em></p>\n<p><em>For my first-ish time working on a multiplayer game, I can say that a lot of the mechanics\u00a0I implemented were able to be translated pretty well.\u00a0A lot of what went wrong went into getting stuff in-game to sync up to the other players while\u00a0maintaining their code optimized.\u00a0 For this project we used Photon and there was a limited\u00a0amount of multiplayer syncing functions that we could call.</em></p>\n<p><em>To alleviate that issue, we spent a lot of time trying to optimize our code so that these\u00a0multiplayer syncing functions didn't run too much.\u00a0 At the end of the day, we had to cut\u00a0the doors because the way I coded and optimized them was still too resource-intensive, causing the game to repeatedly crash when playing.</em></p>\n<p><em>There were some changes that were made in the name of stability such as removing the doors,\u00a0but the mechanics also went through some changes.\u00a0 The spectator system that I originally\u00a0coded let users scroll through a series of predetermined cameras set up around the level.\u00a0That was soon changed to only being able to spectate other players so that the spectator\u00a0system would work in a multiplayer setting and because there wasn't a lot of time left.</em></p>\n<p><em>I learned that making multiplayer games are an entirely different beast than making single-player games.\u00a0 In order to optimize code, there had to be strategic variables that would\u00a0sync up to all the other players so that they could each individually handle a separate\u00a0a certain operation.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Collin Spence -</em></strong> <em>\"Hello,\u00a0I was responsible for our game's enemy AI. The enemy (demon) traverses the level while the players are looking for the seals, and can only be deterred by holy water. If the players haven't gotten all of the seals, the holy water wouldn't kill the enemy. It would just cause the enemy to teleport away and become immune to holy water temporarily. Once all the seals were found, the holy water could be used to defeat the demon.</em></p>\n<p><em>We wanted our game to have a single enemy hunting all the players, but since the map is quite large the demon couldn't just wander. It also couldn't continuously pursue the players as it would quickly overwhelming and very difficult to win. To juggle this, the AI uses a state machine with three states: roaming, hunting, and chasing. When roaming the AI would wander the map randomly, waiting until it either hears or sees a player. If it hears a player, it will transition into the hunting state and travel toward where it thinks the player is, returning to roam if it doesn't see the player once it reaches that point. If it sees a player while roaming or hunting it will begin chasing, speeding up, and actively pursuing the player. If it loses sight of the player, it will revert to hunting and then into either roaming or chasing.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I'm very happy with how the state machine came out. With the addition of an encounter trigger, which will move the demon closer to a player if it hasn't hunted or chased for a while, the AI behaves in a way that feels fair but still frightening. The biggest issue with the AI was integrating it into a multiplayer setting. If the AI tries to run on multiple instances at the same time, it essentially breaks. So we had to get the AI to disable itself on all but one instance and then sync the other instances up with the enabled one. Unfortunately, that meant that if the enabled instance the demon would stop moving entirely, so I had to make it detect when players disconnect to make sure that it never turns off.</em></p>\n<p><em>My biggest takeaway from this project was the importance of optimization. Since the server we're using has a relatively low cap on the number of server calls it could perform, making the AI work with as few calls as possible was very important. If there were too many calls, we consistently got crashes and disconnects.\"</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Long Jia Lin -</em></strong> <em>\"Hi, I am one of the programmers on the group.

I also spent some time placing the items around the map during the end of the project to help alleviate the workload.</em></p>\n<p><em>For this project, I was happy to see a lot of communication and participation,\u00a0which makes this game project a lot more enjoyable.

It was really challenging and frustrating when I was trying to synchronize the\u00a0flashlight.

It had helped that we had done a multiplayer game for our final game jam, the only jam we had once we had chosen our final groups.
