Destroy them all.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Made in 7 days for #WeeklyGameJam26. The theme was: Mystery Machine. I tried to embed the idea as a machine making and testing tanks. But I didn't had enough time to tell this story so there is mostly just gameplay. I'll make updates on this game and make it reach it's finished state. There are 15 levels with increasing difficulty pace. If you finish the game, you'll get bonus time points. You can compete in online scoreboard made with dreamlo. If any mac or Linux users want to play this game send a message to me so I can build in your OS.</p>\n\r\nPlay it on full screen to avoid possible bugs. If you want to enter online scoreboard please download the windows version.
