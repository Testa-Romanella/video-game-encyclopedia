You need to consume as much media as possible to become an informed and productive member of society. Your entire self-worth depends on it. Use my convenient tool to consume many random videos at once, and finally become a well adjusted person!</p>\n<p><strong>SORRY FOR DOWNLOAD-ONLY.</strong>\u00a0There are CORS permissions issues with the WebGL version that I can't do anything about :'( so you need to download the desktop version.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>PLAY ON WIFI ONLY!</strong> The game is streaming tons of videos from the internet at the same time so it can use tons of MB.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTENT WARNING (18+):</strong>\u00a0This game pulls from ~1600 public domain videos from the 40s-80s, which contain all kinds of things including war, racism, probably some porn.\u00a0 I have no idea what you might see. You can check the full list of video titles here:\u00a0https://github.com/foolmoron/TheConsumer/blob/master/Assets/video%20data.json</p>\n<p><strong>CONSUME</strong>\u00a0to add a new video to the screen<br/></p>\n<p><strong>CLICK THE CORRECT WORDS</strong>\u00a0based on the text's style formatting (the word is also somewhat related to the video, but that's unreliable)</p>\n<p><strong>LET INCORRECT WORDS PASS\u00a0</strong>otherwise you will lose points when clicking them</p>\n<p><strong>TURN OFF THE TV</strong> to end the game and save your points before they are lost<br/></p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong>\u00a0<br/>- Each video has 1 correct text format and 1 incorrect text format. Memorize the correct and incorrect styles so you can make the right choice.<br/>- You gain exponentially more points the more videos there are on screen, but the text style differences get harder and more subtle<br/>- If you drop below 0 points, the TV will turn off. Try staying alive for as long as possible with a high #\u00a0of panels.<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>SOURCE CODE\u00a0:\u00a0</strong>https://github.com/foolmoron/TheConsumer</p>\n<p><strong>PLUGINS</strong>: TextMesh Pro, AV Pro free trial (this causes the watermark on the videos, which you should just ignore)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71c/71ca60b3c495f8605610eb230f39b35d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["foolmoron"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
