Inspired by games like Townscaper, Ymir, and Foundation, I wanted to scale down the standard city builder, and shoot for a small/low-poly take on the genre. Made in three days, I used Unity for the development and Houdini for the assets/models. The game board has endless variation, utilizing the procedural power of Houdini and HEngine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is technically the first ~complete~\u00a0\u00a0and ~polished~ game that I have released. I undertook this project to enhance my ability to produce under time pressure and contain project ideation to an achievable scope.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hope you get a few minutes of interesting gameplay out of it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T11:30:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535b9cc3672f366c5a225fe4fe342c58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lukewilliford"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
