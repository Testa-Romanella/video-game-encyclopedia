You only have 1 hit point, good luck surviving!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Game concept</strong> is that you, your spells and the enemies have all once use, you have Basic Spell (Left Mouse Button), Ultimate Spell (Right Mouse Button) and Utility Spell (Space Bar) and you get to cast one of those three and get fed a new array of possible abilities. They also have additive effects, for example, they are larger, they fly through walls if they shouldn't hit them, they start nesting like a bee hive and after hitting enemies hit many more enemies. Ultimate abilities are obviously much more powerful than the basic ones, however, initial plan was to make it either mana gated or picking up drops on the map. Unfortunately we didn't get to that feature and it will be expanded upon after the official gamejam's time.</p>\n<p><strong>Build 2</strong> is the first of many bugfixing patches, fixes UI and Health to work properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Build 3</strong> is out, fixing a number of spells, enemy projectiles no longer shoot through walls!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Next one or two more builds should completely fix every non effective or not correctly working spell!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T10:58:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/734/734e71646d92b6f34ef7736760c6e049.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Illthani", "Imbure"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
