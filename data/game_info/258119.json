Unfortunately, it is broken, and can only receive signals, not transmit them. The three pieces required to repair the radio are scattered around the forest. You must find them in order to fix the radio and call for help, while managing your radio's battery life and avoiding the specters.</p>\n<p>The radio has three channels: the first (low frequency) can detect nearby spirits. The second (medium frequency) plays some music. The third (high frequency) can detect batteries (indicated by higher pitched beeps) and radio pieces (indicated by lower pitched beeps). Using the radio and listening to any of these channels drains its battery, which is indicated by a colored light. Batteries can be found around the woods, similar to the pieces.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: movement</p>\n<p>SPACE: turn radio on/off</p>\n<p>R: change radio's channel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78b/78bca049aa933801e7d47147f31b8205.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Andrew Klinge"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
