Although this game is playable on PS5, some features available on PS4 may be absent. See PlayStation.com/bc for more details.<br/>Inspired by classic adventure games and the origins of the survival horror genre, Sense \u2013 A Cyberpunk Ghost Story celebrates the slow, cerebral creep of dread instead of relying on over-the-top action or jump scares. With careful attention to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, this futuristic tale seamlessly blends 2.5D exploration and problem solving with suspenseful ghost encounters that act as paranormal glitches in our own reality.<br/><br/>In Neo Hong Kong, 2083, a young woman named Mei Lin Mak is dragged into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers into the century old mystery, Mei is forced to question her perception of reality and her trust of her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk cityscape, the ruins of the Chong Sing Apartments hide a bloody secret illuminated by the traditions of Chinese folklore and innovations of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare, Mei Lin must explore this complex, piecing together stories of 14 lost souls and discovering the truth of her own family curse.<br/><br/> <br/>Features:<br/>\u2022 Survive the horror using adventure mechanics and exploration.<br/>\u2022 Experience a beautiful, erotic hand-painted art style with Eastern and Western influences.<br/>\u2022 Unlock additional outfits, some of which alter interactions throughout the game.<br/>\u2022 Keep track of the immersive lore with a convenient journal feature.<br/>\u2022 Discover multiple New Game+ modes, alternate endings and hidden extras!<br/>\u2022 Get in the mood with a visceral cinema-length soundtrack.<br/><br/><br/>Offline single player<br/>Enhanced game play on PS4 Pro console<br/><br/><br/>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com/terms-of-service &amp; playstationnetwork.com/privacy-policy). <br/><br/>Software subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense). <br/><br/>One-time license fee for play on account\u2019s designated primary PS4\u2122 system and other PS4\u2122 systems when signed in with that account.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T08:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/732/732561e7e44eeb1de9e7cc0e6adaa3d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
