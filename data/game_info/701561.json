Two player online matches with a basic lobby and such. I made this mostly to test/expand skill sets in networking and multiplayer as well as creating generic operational game mech and feature components that can be useful in later games. ;)\r\nWASD  =&gt; move ship\r\nSPACEBAR =&gt; shoot weapons\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoot the opponent player down!\r\n</p>\n<p>Dodge the other player projectiles! One shot and you're done! (for now)\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoot down the enemies more points and chances to have powerups drop.\r\n</p>\n<p>Dodge the enemies and their projectiles {Enemy spawners being worked on}\r\n</p>\n<p>Enemies have MoveStyles and BehaviourStyles; combined, they allow for many different enemies to be created during runtime (while the game is running).\r\n</p>\n<p>Shoot the middle asteroids to break little chunks off flying in the opponents direction. Each hit gives points. Point display isnt implemented, very basic int atm, I wanna do somethin fancy like a leaderboard so it would require a full controller class, its on the TODO list....\r\n</p>\n<p>Dodge the asteroid chunks! One hit and you're dead! Shoot down the little chunks for more points!\r\n</p>\n<p>Stay on your side of the 'field' (I mean, i guess you could cross over but you cant shoot backwards....\r\n</p>\n<p>Choose between 4 ships (There's stats that can be upgrading during the matches by killing enemies and grabbing the power ups... however...\r\n</p>\n<p>****{POWERUPS ARENT IMPLEMENTED YET}****</p>\n<p>Collect powerups during the match to gain the edge over your opponents\r\n</p>\n<p>***Planned Additions***\r\n</p>\n<p>Room PIN passwords: Create private rooms for you and your friends by setting a room password during room creation.\r\n</p>\n<p>Room Lobby Chat: I gotta learn PUN2 chat implementation still. Coming later.\r\n</p>\n<p>Picking up weapon powerups will equip another weapon to the ship if there are any weapon slots available. Otherwise the weapon powerup will just swap the oldest weapon to swap out. Maybe some kind of swap option could be set during the room lobby screen with the ship selection.\r\n</p>\n<p>Player Spawn Enemies: Players earn points by shooting down enemies and chunks; Players will have an enemy spawner that they control, on the opponents side of the field, off the screen. Tiers of different enemies that can be spawned will be activated as points are accumulated, you can spend these points to spawn extra enemies that only target and damage the opponent ship, however the player spawned enemies still give points to the ship that kills it and you cannot kill your own spawned ships.\r\n<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T07:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/465/465fb71cc33889483e12b31f0324b9d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperKash"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
