The Pok\u00e9mon mobile game had come out not long before, and the rollout in the US was really poorly managed by Niantic -- poor communication, server crashes, you name it. Just when they were getting it semi-functional, I\u00a0moved overseas for a few years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One evening in Nairobi, I woke up and wrote down the outline for this game. That decision and the general shape of the game probably reflect the medication I was on for malaria prophylaxis at the time.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, this was again written as a collaboration with Ben Collins-Sussman, who I think humored me with this project. Since we anticipated finishing writing in the late summer, I put into into IFComp 2016, where it placed 6th out of 58 entries.</p>\n<p>Note that the game has two parts:\u00a0the first is a parody of the Pok\u00e9mon game rollout and is of limited duration; the second part is more of a story. I hope you think it's worth sticking out the initial exploration part to make it to the meat of the story.</p>\n<p>Walkthrough (pdf)</p>\n<p>IFwiki Entry</p>\n<p>IFDb Entry</p>\n<p>Source</p>\n<p>Download file to play in offline interpreter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-28T05:34:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e6044207345b7b5a29ceeb7e1b9ade8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dhakajack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
