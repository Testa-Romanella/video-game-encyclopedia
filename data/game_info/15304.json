You keep nothing. Except your memory of past loops.<br/>Use your knowledge of previous loops to find out what causes the time disruptions and break free once and for all.<br/><br/>Every loop will be exactly the same, unless you change it through your actions.<br/>However, to increase replayability, no two playthroughs will be alike. Every time you start a completely new game \u2013 so when you start Loop 0 \u2013 the world is randomized. Characters change, locations alter and maybe you'll even get access to a completely new ending.Difficulty WarningThis is not a casual game. It will not help you. If you don't pay attention, <br/>you will miss important details and you won't be able to escape the loop.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7bf/7bf251d8c4029aa257ad4240818b809c.jpg", "website": "http://www.pixel-maniacs.com/escapetheloop", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixel Maniacs"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixel Maniacs"], "esrb_rating": null}
