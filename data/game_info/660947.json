There are only 3 levels in total ranging in difficulty.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I have ever made! It's short and simple but it took me like 3 days to make. <br/>I used Brackeys tutorial (Highly recommend) (oh and all 100% credit goes to him for the game since it is basically a version of his game :&gt;):</p>\n<p>(Oh also I am part of Interdream games, so this is why it says \"made by Interdream games student\". Expect some games from us in the future :&gt;)<br/></p>\n<p>(OH YEAH and theres a bug where the game is stuck on credits and quit doesn't work, just resfresh the page :&gt; its also supposed to say \"thanks for playing\" and not just \"playing\"!)</p>\n<p>Anyways, enjoy the game!
