The goal is to clear 150 Lines throughout 15 Levels (10 Lines per Level). This mode will test your endurance, but also provides a convenient training opportunity to master your Tetris skills before jumping into a head-to-head battle.  <br/><br/>\u25cf World Battle: Play against other people in head-to-head matches. The goal is to knock out your opponent before time expires by clearing as many lines as possible. If time expires before a KO occurs, the person with the most lines sent will win the match. This mode includes hassle-free matchmaking that quickly finds similarly-skilled opponents to battle against.  <br/><br/>\u25cf Local Battle: Play face-to-face against a friend or family member using the same device. The goal is to push your opponent to the top of the Matrix, but if a winner isn&amp;#39;t declared within the first two minutes, both players will feel the pressure of the sudden death squeeze.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:30:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f281249d1a26f922fad0f82aad922192.jpeg", "website": "http://www.tetrisonline.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Tetris Online"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Tetris Online"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
