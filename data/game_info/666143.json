A roguelike where the player has to navigate through a dungeon with randomly generated floor layouts, finding different kinds of rooms, treasure and having to overcome enemies. The goal of the game is to reach the 100th floor, which is where the game ends.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by Gameboy games. The controls are simple and immediately clear as to how they work, while the graphics are monotone to create that dark and unclear atmosphere of being in a dungeon without immediately obscuring the player's view.<br/></p><p><strong>=CREDITS=</strong><br/>Music: maoudamashii.jokersounds.com <br/></p><p><strong>=SOURCE=</strong><br/>https://github.com/GoggledPetilil/SLMP-Roguelike\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:19:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d7/4d70e058eb20d6870d66fe04879f8819.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Peti"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
