It saves on electricity for lighting, and Santa gets a nice lie in, so it's a good idea, right?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Santa has failed to factor in rush hour traffic and now has to deal with that on his sleigh ride from house to house. And traffic can get quite violent this time of year, so do watch out for the explosions.\u00a0And\u00a0do\u00a0make sure\u00a0the\u00a0present\u00a0doesn't get\u00a0too\u00a0damaged,\u00a0since\u00a0it\u00a0may\u00a0contain something\u00a0volatile, so\u00a0be\u00a0careful! Santa has also managed to drop a bunch of presents all over the city,\u00a0 somehow, so you might want to go and pick those up too.<br/></p>\n<strong>MY THOUGHTS:<br/></strong>\n<p>I quite enjoyed this game, even if I only had 3 days to make it in out of the whole week! I'm pleased with how the graphics came out, particularly since at the start I wasn't too sure, and I like the top-down view of the game - it's quite fun driving behind buildings and hiding secrets there! The car AI I'm particularly fond of, because it manages to create such chaotic scenes so quickly, and it does it with such a simple AI - it doesn't even know where the roads are, which is why you can find it offroading so often. One thing I would've liked to improve would be the connection to the theme, since delivering presents at day being the<strong> opposite </strong>of delivering presents at night is a bit of a tenuous link, but I still like the final product regardless. And why don't you tell me in the comments what scores you managed to get? It'd be interesting to see how well people do, so I'd love to hear back about that! Can you beat the score of 25020? And thank you, most of all, for playing!</p>\n\n<p>Made with Unity 2019.2.8f<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:41:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d257508f4c69a75ef80ccee17af001cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
