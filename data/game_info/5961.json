{"id": 5961, "slug": "wide-sky", "name": "Wide Sky", "name_original": "Wide Sky", "description": "For a marine mammal, the hedgehog spends a disconcerting amount of time on land. What do they want, what are they up to?<br/><br/>Hedgehogs are troubled spirits, and yet, they never fail to entertain the masses with their acrobatic feats. Many people don&amp;#39;t know, however, that hedgehogs aren&amp;#39;t born this way. Hedgehogs need to be trained and molded into the tiny, fiscally responsible acrobats we know and love.<br/><br/>That&amp;#39;s where you come in. <br/><br/>Train your hedgehog in more than 40 challenges and keep his cunning mind from veering. We will give you a sensible amount of ropes (11) and 6 special powers, like the ability to deploy a parachute, control the wind or summon a vortex. Your challenges will change with the nature of those powers.<br/><br/>So, crash those orbs as fast as you can, collect those stars and keep track of your performance with built-in stats. We will even let you tweak the rope physics, because we&amp;#39;re not just accomplished scientists, we&amp;#39;re also human.<br/><br/>You might encounter detailed animation along the way. But don&amp;#39;t fall for it. It&amp;#39;s designed to fool you into empathy.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1d/b1db4535cad04399fafe582c533424b2_tEKVoQH.jpeg", "website": "http://www.widesky-ios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marcus Eckert"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Marcus Eckert"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
