At present, there are too many types of games of the Three Kingdoms (Eastern Han Dynasty) on the market and the homogenization is serious, and high-quality Chinese history games are often produced abroad. The culture of the two Han Dynasties is splendid, and there are many talents. Why didn't we introduce the game of historical themes of the Western Han Dynasty? So we chose the theme of Hanwu emperor, who is the representative of the Western Han Dynasty, for production. The team pursues simple and pure play experience in design concept. At present, there are five small partners in full-time development of Emperor Hanwu biography, which has been produced for one year. Of course, there are still shortcomings in the game.
