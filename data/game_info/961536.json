Please refrain from purchasing it if you are not ready for challenges.<br/><br/>The Survival &amp; Horror game series is a collection of several different settings and plots brought together under the umbrella of one genre and mechanics. If you love Survival-horror, then these games are for you, each with its own unique story, atmosphere, enemies, puzzles, and weapons. Find a game that suits your tastes in your favorite genre.<br/><br/>Hangman's Rope tells the story of a cursed town in the Wild West. Immerse yourself in the ambiance of the Wild West and its mysterious events, and uncover the truth about what lurks on the grim streets of this town. Fight ghosts, solve puzzles, search for survivors, and unravel the secret that this town holds.<br/><br/>The main focus is on challenging gameplay and the atmosphere of the dark Wild West in the survival horror genre.<br/><br/>You will have to explore a vast nonlinear location of the Wild West.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the game, you will encounter various types of enemies. To fight them, you have firearms as well as a special mechanic of adding phosphorus to an oil lantern. By igniting phosphorus, you gain immunity to enemy attack. You will constantly have to decide how to approach each situation: whether to spend phosphorus now or save it for later, whether to run or fight. Be cautious, as there are more enemies than resources to eliminate them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Phosphorus serves as both your defense and weapon. Where can you find more of it? Of course, on the gloomy streets of the city and in deserted houses where people once lived. Death in this game is not a reason for despair; you just need to understand where you should go and what actions are advantageous. Challenge yourself!<br/><br/>P.S.
