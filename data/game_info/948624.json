I decided to improve and expand on the idea. Currently there's one race track available and you can play in 2-player mode to see who's objectively the best driver in the Retrowave world!</p>\n<p>Planned features:</p>\n<p>-Amazing retro-wave style nostalgic music</p>\n<p>-Amazing'er special effects</p>\n<p>-Car Selection</p>\n<p>-Track selection</p>\n<p>-Racing with AI enemies</p>\n<p>-More interesting views</p>\n<p>-Much needed optimization (It might make your GPU go brrrr)</p>\n<p>As per usual, everything so far is made by Me. You're more than welcome to follow my progress as I ironically plan to improve it after the Improve My Game Jam. I'll try to post new versions of the game as soon as I can.</p>\n<p>Feedback is much appreciated, altough I am already aware of many issues and updates are coming soon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T10:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cc/6cc322203d02bde939d0f2985e2c2c89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MAKSES"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
