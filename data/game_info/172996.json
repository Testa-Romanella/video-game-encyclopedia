Tipio! of clan Clavis! The world renowned typing instructor! You lower your blade and pick up the old, discarded keyboard that lies in front of you. You begin to TYPE.</em></p>\n\n<p>Made in 72 for the 41st\u00a0Ludum Dare's Jam. The genres: Typing Teacher and Roguelike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is pretty feature complete on the typing half, but I didn't have enough time to make the roguelike portion how I wanted.\u00a0I want to make a polished, full version some day, but for now I'm just going to make a small update in the coming week or so.\u00a0So keep your eyes peeled and your fingers cracked. It might also completely break. Watch out!</p><p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>Made a small edit to fix restarting the challenge level, since I didn't know it was bugged that badly. The UI is still finicky. Just try not to go too fast through it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>ENTER</strong> to continue in most menus.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>YOUR KEYBOARD</strong> to type letters, numbers, and punctuation.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>BACKSPACE</strong> only once you've earned it.</p>\n<p>Use\u00a0<strong>SHIFT</strong> only when typing question marks. Not even capital letters.\u00a0Yeah, sorry about that.</p>\n<p>I didn't test it that much, and the score system is pretty arbitrary. Not sure if the challenge is easy or hard or possible.\u00a0If you beat it, please say so in the comments so I can congratulate you.</p>\n\n<p>Font: Retro Computer</p>\n<p>Thanks to Connor who whipped up the song two hours before the deadline.</p>\n<p>And to Jackson for he face.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/664/664c669fa2f292e39809aca062506cef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NedStormFish"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
