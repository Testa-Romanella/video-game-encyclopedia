See Worthy has curated a number of activities to help distract patchers from the challenges of occlusion training.  Games so fun, in fact, any child will enjoy!  See Worthy games are focused on using vision skills to win that are fun for all children but specifically helpful to those who need to further develop their vision.  All games require the player to use eyes to track objects or to search for objects, encouraging  the user to focus with the intent to develop stronger control with use of eyes. The most unique aspect of the See Worthy App is the surprise exercise element.  Randomly set alarms for movement go off mid game to get children moving.  The alternation of physical activity and video games prevent the blank stare all parents catch on their child\u2019s face during tablet/technology play time. No ads and no pop ups make this a safe app to entertain your child or distract your patcher!   All games and movements are inspired by vision therapy activities and help with body coordination and the prevention of eyes blankly staring at a device. This app is truly all about vision, action, and play!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T04:38:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e61/e617bb0ac2f740348a1f950e04af4c1d_yI0h0Kp.jpg", "website": "https://seeworthypatches.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Listo Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Listo Labs"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
