It was ported to the VIC-20, and TI-99/4A computers. The game is a Donkey Kong clone, with cannonballs and cannons replacing barrels, and a soldier replacing the large ape. On the first level, the player character catches a flag instead of rescuing a girl.</p>\n<p>There are three different levels, the third of which is particularly challenging. After completing the third level, the player views a small celebration scene and then restarts at the first level. Repeated levels only differ from those of the first round in the harsher timing patterns of the game.</p>\n<p>Cannonball Blitz achieved some notoriety in the Apple hacking community as being rather difficult to crack. Track 17, sector D of the game contained the message \"YOU'LL NEVER CRACK IT\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/3246a6769e676a2fb55b54520ea960ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 158, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Apple II"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line", "Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
