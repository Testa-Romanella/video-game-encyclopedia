The gameplay loop is short but hopefully it's also at least somewhat fun, and I'm planning on updating it and adding more features in the future. <br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Move the pink cube with the WASD keys, and use the arrow keys to position the white border on the top, bottom, left, or right of the cube to deflect the red bullets. The game gets more difficult over time, and the goal is to try and get the highest personal score possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T16:23:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b60161c849fc1bedded5cfd9702bc87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Teemalak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
