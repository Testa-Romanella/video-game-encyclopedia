You'll navigate your ship\u00a0through an area of space that is densely populated with asteroids and deploy\u00a0astronaut miners to gather minerals from them. Just make sure you come\u00a0back for them before they run out of oxygen!</p>\n<p><em>Asteroid Miner</em> was created during a week-long community game jam dubbed \"Clone The Game Jam\" where everybody started out with the same base project and had to put their own spin on it to make a new game. The base project was a simple <em>Asteroids </em>clone, and this\u00a0is what I ended up with at the end of the week!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T14:00:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f8/2f81346e885736ed0047d9e12321f2e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GLHF Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
