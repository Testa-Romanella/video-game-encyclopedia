Thank you for your understanding, and I hope I may be able include full voices as my career progresses.<br/><br/>The Motherworm has been destroyed, but there is no such thing as eternal peace.

He is troubled by just one thing\u2014why do these new villains resemble friends who he thought were long dead?<br/><br/>Unhack 2 is a sequel to the first game I ever published on Steam. To cater for new players, Unhack 2 will start with a summary of the original title. Here are some of the features included in this sequel:<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>A more mature story:</strong><br/><br/>Unhack 1 was created in 2012, so as a student of the craft, I like to think my skills have improved since then. I am, of course, also a bit older now. While Unhack 2\u2019s characters are still an energetic bunch, I believe the cast goes through more of a mature journey this time around.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Exploring the human VS AI dilemma:</strong><br/><br/>AI will play a bigger role as the years go on, so this is a good time to explore some of the questions involved. What does it mean to be human, anyway? Is it possible for AI to understand how it feels to be us? I fell in love with the topic during my research for this sequel, to an extent where I would like to explore these issues again in the future. To avoid being preachy, Unhack 2 is still very much entertainment first.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Puzzle gameplay:</strong><br/><br/>While story takes the lead this time, puzzle gameplay does make a return in Unhack 2. In the original game, players had to constantly pause between slots to read the dialogue, which in retrospect was not the best mix of narrative and gameplay. This is why the elements are separated in Unhack 2. I want to explore other methods in future games, so I hope we can go through this journey together.<br/><br/>Though the puzzles are smaller in scale this time, they are in some ways more complex. Let\u2019s see if unhackers are ready for the challenge. Please note the puzzles can be skipped for those who wish to focus on the narrative.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>More art featuring Rosuuri:</strong><br/><br/>My budget and experience were limited back in Unhack 1, so I was unable to feature the number of artworks I really wanted. In this sequel, I am able to showcase more illustrations (most of which contain spoilers, which is why they are not shown on this page). Our artist this time is Rosuuri. Her works are well-known in the community, and since she is one of the best around, there is a good reason for that.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>3D-rendered backgrounds:</strong><br/><br/>Due to budget constraints in Unhack 1, I was unable to include proper background illustrations. Helen \u201cTayola\u201d Schwieger is our 3D background artist in Unhack 2, and she has put together a collection of renders for us to enjoy throughout the game. These 3D backdrops fit our digital theme nicely.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Brainfed returns as the composer:</strong><br/><br/>(Unhack 1 album art by Hybridmink)<br/><br/>Brainfed (Matt Hamm) provided a fitting soundtrack for us in Unhack 1. He has graciously given his time again for Unhack 2, and thanks to him, this sequel contains another soundtrack that belongs in the Unhack universe. Several tracks may even include nostalgic references to the original title.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Thank you! I hope you will find the experience worthwhile.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e978cb0d05de13342520a364665036c.jpg", "website": "http://unhack2.invertmouse.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 37, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 287, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["InvertMouse"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["InvertMouse"], "esrb_rating": null}
