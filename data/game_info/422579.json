It consists of a Twitter bot (https://twitter.com/afleetingworld) that is connected to a number of different\u00a0versions of the game currently in circulation on USB sticks around the world. Each one of the versions is set in a different climate zone, resulting in different looking worlds and different species of plants. The game is also accompanied by a downloadable B-side remix game priced based on the current global average temperature, which you can find here: https://loths.itch.io/this-too-has-passed, each sale of which funds a tree.</p>\n<p>This version is a special limited time release that samples plant and terrain data\u00a0from locations around New Zealand. It will only be playable until the 1st of May.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T05:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cef1328a15b7c22b17ab385b456ab6af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 154, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OldLoths"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
