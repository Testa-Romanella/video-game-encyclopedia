As you retrieve the cores, you are pulling power directly out of the ship - making it darker and reducing the oxygen levels on the station.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong>Standard first person controls, WASD to move around, mouse to aim and shoot. Holding the E key will open the Main door back to the airlock and also retrieve the power cores.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective<br/></strong>Survive the scavenge on the space station, retrieving either 3, 6, 9 or 12 cores (depending on the difficulty you pick). Kill the spiders that are attacking you - you will need to find ammo in order to do this! If you don\u2019t you\u2019re probably gonna have a bad time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b48/b48d7ae8f62167ec8897815df79ad392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stefan Richings"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
