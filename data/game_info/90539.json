The two of you will be going to a fancy restaurant and he's supposed to try and not murder you during the date, what about afterwards then? Well, that depends on how well the date goes. Based on an interactive RP quiz on Quotev<br/></p>\n<p>=DEV NOTES=</p>\n<p>Hello, dear player! It's me, Akemi~! Thank you for checking out this short little game. I made this game in the span of a week for my Quotev community, but I want other creepypasta fans to enjoy this as well!\u00a0This is the first project I've ever made in Ren'py and the first game I've ever finished making. Snowy and I had a lot of fun in the process of making this game, so we hope you have fun playing it as well!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Snowy One made a quiz on Quotev called \"Date Night With Eyeless Jack\" and the moment I saw her post about the concept, I knew it would be dating sim material! You can take the quiz here:<br/>https://www.quotev.com/quiz/10871278/Date-Night-with-Eyeless-Jack-Interactive-Ro...</p>\n<p>I was super excited when she published the quiz, because my suspicions were right. Even before she published it, I already planned on turning it into a game, if it was within my capacity. So, that's how this game came to be! I'd like to thank Snowy for giving me permission to turn her quiz into a game. If you're interested in more of her content, or her in general as she is a very sweet and kind creative person, you can follow her on Quotev!<br/>https://www.quotev.com/TheSnowyOne</p>\n<p>I'd also like to give a huge thanks to my beta testers who were also with me along the whole process! They make great content, too!
