I hope you enjoy your\u00a0<strong>Aerial Rave Extreme Nature Adventure</strong>!</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move - WASD/Arrow Keys or Left Stick.</p>\n<p>Jump - Space Bar or A (Xbox layout)/X (Playstation layout).</p>\n<p>Trick - Left Ctrl or B/Circle.</p>\r\nSo... what is this?\r\n<p>At the moment, just a playground. Have fun running around bouncing off giant plants and orbiting small planets while breakdancing.</p>\n<p>This was created for the 'A Game By it's Cover' game jam.\u00a0 It was originally inspired by this Famicase design\u00a0http://famicase.com/17/softs/013.html\u00a0by\u00a0Michael Shillingburg (IG:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/planet.gif/).</p>\r\nIs that it?\r\n<p>NO!</p>\n<p>This being a jam game, it is very limited in scope. There are a lot of features being worked on. Subscribe and all that jazz to be notified of future updates.</p>\r\nWhat's next?\r\n<ul><li>Actual levels.</li><li>More plant types.</li><li>Music and sound effects.</li><li>More tricks.</li><li>Combo system.</li><li>Manual camera control.</li></ul>\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n<ul><li>The game is silent. May I recommend some smooth synthwave... (wink)</li><li>No friendly exit. You need to Alt+F4 or close the window.</li><li>You can perform the trick action completely for free.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T06:34:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/964/964f08df7fae315cb74a24e776679942.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bunnybreaker"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
