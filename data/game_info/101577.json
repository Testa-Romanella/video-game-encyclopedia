Theme: Small World.</p><p>Steve is cursed. The curse makes people that recognizes him explode. Violently. Luckily, Steve is a smart guy and moved to the most remote town where no one could possibly know him. Or so he thought. Turns out he runs into old colleagues, friends, neighbours, pretty much everyone he's ever known, constantly. </p><p>Steve locks himself up in his home as long as he can, but sadly, Steve has to eat. And shopping for Steve is truly a dangerous mission.</p><p>Ludum dare : https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/steve-and-the-curse-of-the-hermit<br/></p><p>Made by Jonas &amp; Bj\u00f6rn at Goblin Portal<br/>Music by Abstraction. www.abstractionmusic.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e8005873853e6e434285853678df1874.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goblin Portal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
