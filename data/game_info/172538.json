In creating Precipice I wanted to capture the tension inherent in Red Shift and the striking contrast between the birds and their hostile surroundings. To me the birds in Red Shift seemed to be hanging on to life but only by the barest of threads. Their doom felt inevitable and the only question was how long could they survive for. It was this feeling that I wanted to capture in Precipice. There is no happy ending, the birds will always fall. How long they survive is up to you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a0/2a02f138b46ed7cb02609ed5b1e7ec90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
