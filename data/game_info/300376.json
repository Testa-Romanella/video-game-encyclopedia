{"id": 300376, "slug": "dying-goes-wrong", "name": "Dying goes wrong", "name_original": "Dying goes wrong", "description": "<p>A game about the eternal fight between life and death, where the player must incarnate Death, the Grim Reaper, to put an end to every single lifeform. Everything will die by your boney hands, struck by the Eternal Suffering Scythe!!! But it's so damm kawaii that you will love it, and everybody will be pleased to die by your omnipotence will of slaughter! :3</p>\n<p>We thought about the eternal Life Cycle, were neither death or life wins at all. Therefore, as a player being the Grim Reaper themself,will always try to put and end to life. Nonetheless, life can overcome death, but just for a little time, like the player hitting the Restart button or quitting the game. He might play again, as Death will go again to end life. Lots of lifes will we born again, but will we ended as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We used some public domain and Creative Commons sounds and music.
