The first modification I made was creating a new level from scratch. It is more challenging compared to the first two. Which is my second modification. As you play the game the levels become more challenging and complex. The final change I did was to the main menu, by changing the color scheme and sprites that were used in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Created by: Joey Starzynski<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cf/8cfa2814a4ac562f3fa9ce789bf1526a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["joeystarz24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
