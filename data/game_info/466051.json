However, this black hole is particularly moody. When purple, it will follow your mouse pointer when you use the E-key spell. When blue, it's confused and erratic, going in all directions. The scariest is its orange form, which shows the black hole is angry at its creator and chases you around the map. Can you control it long enough to devour the whole country?</p>\n<p><strong>Lore:</strong></p>\n<p>Choose between the mad scientist Jim \u201cSingularity\u201d Darkness or the enthusiast witch Lilly \u201cStartaker\u201d Fusion to try to control the beast. Beware, as it might easily get <strong>Out of control</strong> and destroy you or itself!\r\n\tAs to manipulate the black hole, you will have to give it commands : Should it stay in place, where should it go, should it follow you\u2026 With these, ensure it is sufficiently nourished to survive as long as possible. But be careful to avoid the elements attracted by the black hole, as they might hurt you!</p>\n<p><strong>__________________________________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p>The World Eater is our submission for the 2020\u2019s GMTK Game Jam, themed \u201cOut of Control\u201d.</p>\n<p>Team Lead: ApricotWTF</p>\n<p>Game Design: ApricotWTF, chic5</p>\n<p>Art by: Nanako Shu;</p>\n<p>Code by: ApricotWTF, chic5, Frord;</p>\n<p>Music by: Massimiliano.vi, Stunbox (?);</p>\n<p>Scenario by: Patchoulidere.C;</p>\n<p>Special Thanks: Anu, Aeon;</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:08:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ce/5cef7178e805716287571165b42a57f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ApricotWTF"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
