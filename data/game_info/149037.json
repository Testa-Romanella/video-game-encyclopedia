Below there are three buttons (Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz). If the shown number is divisible by 3 you have to press Fizz if it is divisible by 5 press Buzz and if it is divisible by 3 and 5 press FizzBuzz. If it is not divisible by 3 or 5 just wait for the next number.<br/>This sounds easy, but you only have a short amount of time to make the right decision. The Android Wear part of the app is exactly the same. If you reach a new highscore on your smartwatch it will be automatically synchronized with the device.</p><p><strong>-Youtube-<br/></strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuyVfJg8fRo<br/></p><p><strong>-Features-</strong></p> <ul><li>3 modes.
