One day, while drinking beer, they come up with a brilliant idea - to create a superman who will not need food, and will work 24 hours a day. For the experiment, they recruited \"volunteers\" from the street, who already had nothing to lose. Everything went as planned, until the students themselves began to mutate. They began to think badly, and as a result they turned into zombies themselves... The task is to go through the entire maze, destroy two bosses (students), find the keys to the secret doors and get to the exit in one piece.<br/>\r\n3D third-person shooter in which you have to go through a large secret laboratory destroying enemies.
