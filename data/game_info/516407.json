If you paste inaccurately, your opponent will be able to tell which ballot is tampered with.\u00a0 You have stayed up all night, so you have to keep your balance while using the stamps. If you tip over you will spill coffee and it can be a gamechanging tell for you opponent. You can also spill coffee on untampered ballotts to trick the other player into making mistakes.</p>\n<p>The democratic employee's job is to sort the votes into correct boxes, but your opponent is not making it easy for you. You have to figure out what the ballots' original stamps are and sort them into the right box.\u00a0\u00a0If you make five mistakes you lose. If you have room to make more than one mistake at the end, you can commit fraud to put the republican ballots in the democratic box on purpuse to win those last votes.</p>\n<p>Every ballot in each of the boxes count towards their representative party's voting count, regardless of their stamps.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T02:56:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1c5d41499d338809bfdbbcfc79b2bda.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ballerunni", "StefanWR", "Johannes-s-b"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
