It\u00a0took me about a week to complete, working for about 20 hours on it in total. Originally, the scale of this project was much bigger, although due to me becoming busier than expected, I had a change of plan.<br/></p>\n<p>The game consists of 2 arcade style games, an arcade style top down car racing game, and a 1st person \"doom\" style shoot-em-up arcade game;\u00a0with an interactable Arcade \"lobby\" scene.</p>\n<p>The game was really fun to work on, and I\u00a0do plan on returning to this game idea to create more arcade style games, a better arcade lobby scene, and pull it all together much better than it is now, with that being said, I\u00a0do hope you enjoy what I\u00a0put together!</p>\n\n<p>This game was created for\u00a0https://charbomber.itch.io/!</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0https://strawberrycheetah.itch.io/\u00a0for helping with some in-game art!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extra Information about the game:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Within the shoot-em-up game, you have 2 weapons!
