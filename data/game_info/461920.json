The plan backfired and caused society to collapse. The\r\nUnited States government was overthrown by rioters. In the following\r\ndays, the riots spread worldwide and the global economy failed. The\r\nworld shifted to a state of Anarchy. Violent murders and large-scale\r\ndestruction killed most of the global population. Although tragic,\r\nnot all was lost.

Eventually, the preppers constructed a church to conduct\r\nrituals. Life was prosperous for the cult until a member failed\r\nto perform a human sacrifice. You awake after the tragic event.\r\nDiscover what happened and escape from the bunker.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T02:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c2/9c226816374174bf8e0cc8841866c5d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Code Scribe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
