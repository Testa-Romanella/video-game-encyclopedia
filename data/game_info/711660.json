Created for the Godot Wild Jam 40 using the wildcard \"Overworked\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Game can be played entirely with the mouse, but I'm also experimenting with more keyboard-friendly controls for this game than usual, so if you run into any issues or oddities with that, please let me know :)</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p><p>- Goal -</p>\n<p>Complete contracts until the 1 million toy contract is completed. You have 90 days to do this.</p>\n<p>- Elves -</p>\n<p>Elves work at desks. They work faster (to a point) if their environment has higher decor and temperature ratings. They take regular breaks from work.</p>\n<p>- Building -</p>\n<p>Select an item from the shop to begin placing it. You'll see a preview of the areas it will effect for both temperature (red) and decor (green). Click or use the Accept input to build that item.</p>\n<p>- In-Game -</p>\n<p>At any time, you may click on an item to see what it is and delete it for half its original value. You can also click on elves to see their current productivity ratings.</p>\n<p>- HUD -</p>\n<p>The top bar shows what day it is, lets you choose your game speed, and view the overall temperature and decor ratings for your elves. You can also change your View using the dropdown to see the value on each grid cell.</p>\n<p>- Side Bar -</p>\n<p>This bar shows you the progress on your currrent contract, let's you access the shop, this help menu, and the options menu where you can configure audio and input settings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T06:20:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9df/9df7a6b434c431a6caf3f1b81aa17441.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheShaggyDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
