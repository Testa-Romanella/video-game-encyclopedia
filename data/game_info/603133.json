It's just a basic prototype.<br/></p>\n<p>Ideally, while being 100% comfortable, the game would provide timing sensations, \"speed\" sensations, and the joy of overcoming \"platformer challenges\". It's still a bit vague, I'm working on the design pillars.<br/></p>\n<p>Basically, the goal is to explore locomotion in VR, a very important subject!</p><p>This Fragment is here for \"archiving\" purposes. It does not meet the goals listed above, but some testers found it interesting already.<br/></p><p>There are 2 levels for ~10mn of gameplay, you can aim for 100% collectibles. Each level can be speed run in less than 2mn.</p><p><strong>If you happen to test this experience, I'm very interested in your feedbacks, do not hesitate to post a comment here on itch. :)</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T07:44:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d1153d79d6edb42f893f22b7b6eb39c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["llnaej"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
