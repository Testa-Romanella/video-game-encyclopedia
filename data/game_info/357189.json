You play as Puff the Blowfish and must help him keep the Ocean clean. Use the arrow keys to move and space bar to blow up a bubble. Once Puff has reached full size he can release a bubble that will pick up the trash and push it out of the ocean! I hope to add more trash variants as well as powerups for Puff to pick up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T08:23:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fc/1fc32cb1ea17adf5b46bfec814b616ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balush"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
