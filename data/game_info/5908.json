The Mayan long count calendar ends on December 21, 2012. There are some that still hold true to the old belief that the Earth belongs not to us, instead we belong to the Earth. Still, in the end our fate is inexplicably intertwined to the fate of our home world. <br/><br/>In the year 2000 a massive cover up was instigated by the US Government and the UN, not just any cover up but one that will decide the fate of our race. In a hidden cave in the wastes of Texas members of a secret division of the US Army found what can only be termed as the remains of a battle between \u201cRobots\u201d. After careful studies and intense research it was discovered that the remains date back at least 300 million years. Later on during a mapping mission a team found the reason of this battle, a functioning \u201cAnti-matter Power Tap\u201d (AMPT) in the form of a small box with pulsing lights. This discovery led to many innovations in military weapons tech and civilian industrial tech, including long range space flight! Due to the sensitive nature of this discovery the US Government ordered a base built over the excavation site to preserve operational security. This new high tech base was placed under the command of the United States Unified Space Command (USUSC). With scientists of all branches of the United States military working around the clock to decipher the secrets of Alien technology, this led to a huge jump in our technology base. Monday morning 10-17-12 a young scientist noticed the lights on the box were pulsing faster than before, just like in the movies this was taken as an indication of danger. 2 days later three people showed up on the base with rather large and scary looking weapons, these people were part of an international team that did not exist.<br/><br/>The time is October 21, 2012, and the USUSC/UN Space Station \u201cLady Luu\u201d detected large groups of unidentified flying objects headed on a course for Earth at high speeds.<br/><br/>The time is October 23, 2012, and countless robots broke through the atmosphere and began what seemed to be a search for something. Meanwhile at the hidden base the AMPT suddenly stopped pulsing. At this exact moment all Alien craft headed straight for Texas\u2026\u2026.. <br/><br/>\u221a GOAL:<br/>2012 Defense Free is a game you can play either to shoot down the alien enemies or defense your base.<br/><br/>\u221a FEATURES:<br/>Bulit-in Open Feint Leaderboards<br/>Awesome animation and detailed graphics<br/>Realistic sound<br/>Easy and intuitive control<br/>Obtain new weapons when level up<br/>6 different weapons (P90, M4A1, R.E.A.S.O.N, AC130 and etc..)<br/>Tilt your Iphone/Ipod Touch to scroll left and right.<br/>Call for ac130 drop to get help from a strategic bomber.
