It's not Harvard or anything, but it's still something...<br/><br/>HUH!?? This place is NOT like what I'd imagined! My professor just gave me a couple of quick lectures - like some kind of in-game tutorial for noobs - and then ran off! Leaving ME to take care of his creepy-looking animals. Actually... I'm not even sure if these are even animals at all? Professor called them 'Fantamals'. Am I in some kind of Farm-sim Valley?<br/><br/>WHAT?! Someone stepped up to me while I was out shopping, and is challenging me to a Fantamal fight! He keeps his one in a weird bottle...<br/><br/>That's right - Professor gave me one of those bottles too when he gave me the Fantamal. Guess I should've paid attention during that tutorial instead of just clicking through...<br/><br/>Ok then - I Got It!
