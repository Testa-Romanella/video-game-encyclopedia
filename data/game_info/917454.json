Play the first game here (single-player).<br/></p>\n<p>Made\u00a0during #ALTCTRL by a developer who has occasionally scratched a back. With music by Insidebeat.</p>\n<p>Notes:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>This game requires you to hold your keyboard on your back. If you're using a laptop you'll need to plug in an external keyboard.</li><li>This is a coop game, you will need two people to play. If you're looking for a single-player game, try the first one. In this game, one player isn't allowed to see the screen, use props if necessary to restrict their vision.</li><li>Some keyboards don't work properly with certain combinations of 3 or more keys (but the game doesn't really require them, that's only useful for cheating).</li><li>Button mashing is for cheaters. Plus you could press a key that closes the game.</li><li>The game supports QWERTY, QWERTZ, and AZERTY keyboard layouts. You can  switch them from the menu (press escape during the tutorial to go to  the menu).</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-30T10:36:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/999/999bcdcab8a0513c468fd0aa3a413bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
