It gets even worse when the big man downstairs informs you that you\u00a0have one year\u00a0to live. Luckily, there's a way out. Your boss offers to extend your life sentence if you can make some of your less-desirable\u00a0workers take a permanent vacation without attracting too much attention.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>View your kill contract by pressing tab. You'll only get some vague information about who your target is, so you'll have to use tools and your detective skills\u00a0to zero in.\u00a0Then, once you're confident you've found your person, finish the job with a weapon when no one's looking. You can buy\u00a0weapons with the + button in the shop, use the scroll wheel to select them, and click to place them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But be careful! Both tools and weapons cost time, and the clock is always ticking (one day = one second of time). Not only that, getting caught raises suspicion. Too much of this will result in immediate termination. Well, what are you waiting for? Time is money, and you're running out.</p>\n<p>Made over the course of 48 hours\u00a0during the fourth RPI Game Jam!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Art/Animation:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Isabella \"Isa\"\u00a0Remedios\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Programming:</p>\n<ul><li>Jackson DeVico</li><li>Brent Goldstein</li><li>Griffin Bates</li></ul>\n<p>Sound Design:</p>\n<ul><li>Griffin Bates</li></ul>\n<p>Music:</p>\n<ul><li>\"Bossa Antigua\"<br/>\r\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to\u00a0Sylvain Payen for the invaluable feedback and for hosting the jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b3df33e855022963ceffc3cdc1f3dc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chemist02", "JacksonDeVico", "Isa730", "bman7222"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
