It's no wonder you'll have to show this ecosystem who is the dominant animal!</p>\n<p><strong>N\u00eemes is my native town, located in the South-Eastern France</strong>. This city means a lot to me. You'll visit some famous places with this game. Even if it takes place in a distant future, I wanted to leave this city authentic and show you what I needed to show you.</p>\n\n\r\nAre you hardcore enough?\r\n<p>Warcat Parade, that's a Bullet Hell straight out of N\u00eemes - Southern France.
