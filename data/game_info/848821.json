The goal is to create as much damage as possible in under 3 minutes. Can you beat my score of 28.5k points?</p>\r\nWARNING:\r\n<p><em>The game is unbeatable right now, the end screen file path broke, it will be fixed after the voting period. Sorry for the inconvenience. (By unbeatable I mean the game doesn't end, it just doesn't stop at 0).</em></p>\n<p>The game was made in 5 days\u00a0for the Interstellar Game Jam 3, which had the theme of<em> Defy the Laws.\u00a0</em>Their Discord server can be found\u00a0here</p>\n<p>The game has wonky physics, if you fire to your left you can fling your \"bullets\" into the air higher than on the right if you aim into the drill. You can shoot your own bullets and cause them to go spinning. The drill also auto-flings the bullets back off the ground.<br/></p>\n<p>Certain objects can only be destroyed by the drill, the only one that has to be destroyed by the drill is the vendor stand. The others you can use either.</p>\n<p>I will release a Windows and Mac build, I was a little too late to the upload</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0I used jhaeka's <em>41 Short, Loopable Background Music Files\u00a0</em>pack.\u00a0Link\u00a0here</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0The Godot license can be found\u00a0here</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0The font I have been using is <em>monogram</em> by datagoblin and can be found\u00a0here</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0I used Chiptone which can be found\u00a0here</p>\r\nActionControlsShootLeft MouseDrillRight MouseMoveWASD<br/>\n\n<p><strong>Points</strong></p>\r\nNormal Window100Gold and Wood Rim Window200Gold Rim Window500<br/>Vendor Stand500Lamppost300Bench300", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T00:33:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28d/28d4abe2f5a9a97939a1f945ba53929b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SlushyManateeGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
