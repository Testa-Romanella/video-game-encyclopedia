Collect new weapons and ammunition along the way, solve puzzles, discover secret areas, all the while, defending yourself from a mercenary armada and their strange contraptions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The journey would not be the same without company so, you'll be joining Hayes, the captain, Cassandra, the cartographer and last but not least, Jerad, the cannoneer. Experience the story (and a lot of chit-chat) through their humorous interactions while dodging traps, cannonballs and heavy fire.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There's more than cannonballs in Jerad's disposal. From flame throwers, roaming rockets and machine guns to flaming bottles of rum, mines and ray guns. Burn, wreck, electrocute and sink the enemy's defenses. But use your weapons wisely, unlike cannonballs those are not so easy to come by!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>During the adventure you can collect Doubloons. As long as you can afford it, with these shiny little golden coins you will be able to recover your ship even from the bottom of the sea! You also have the option to spend your hard earn Doubloons on conquered checkpoints to buy weapons and ammo, but choose wisely, or your journey will be over!<br/><br/><br/>Fortresses are scattered all around the world. From sunny equatorial heat to the icy cold winds of the north, in total there are five unique and vibrant environments to explore and plunder. Plus, here there be monsters! Keep your eyes peeled for five mysterious sea creatures who are all waiting to drag you down into the depths of the sea!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-10T06:10:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71a/71a507e98f03f8f824c65a13c192a89e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Note Missing Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Note Missing Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
