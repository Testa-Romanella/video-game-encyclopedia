Many of these people have been abducted by their own government and taken to facilities where they are experimented on. The aim was to create an army of super soldiers. Scientists working for the government created a virus, which original purpose was to make humans super strong, though they did not want to inject this man-made virus into their own soldiers in case something went wrong, so they started abducting ordinary people and began testing it on them without their consent. They have been working on the virus for years trying to perfect it. Something went wrong with the virus and those injected have mutated into something unhuman. <br/></p><p>Can you escape from the facility?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2888d3304f729a0db596938f2168b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["julieb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
