Also, due to using a free mapping service plan, if more than 25,000 unique users play this application within a month, it will no longer work, and you will need to redownload an updated client the following month to play it again.</p>\n\n<p>Fly around Earth in VR. Select from various airport locations to spawn your plane at and fly using simple virtual controls. Many cities have 3D building support. Peer to Peer 2-Player Multiplayer is supported, but the host must open ports on their router. However, the joining player will be the \"guest\" and will have no control over the plane, they will only be able to ride in it while the host flies it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Index Controllers:\u00a0<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Grab throttle and stick with hand.</li><li>Recenter view by pressing down the touchpad.</li></ul>\n<p>Vive Controllers:</p>\n<ul><li>Grab throttle and stick with grip button.</li><li>Recenter view by pressing down the touchpad.</li></ul>\n<p>Oculus Controllers:</p>\n<ul><li>Grab throttle and stick with grip button.</li><li>Recenter view by pressing X.</li></ul>\n<p>All Controllers:</p>\n<ul><li>Interact with Map buttons by physically touching them</li></ul>\n\n<p>Known limitations/issues:</p>\n<ul><li>Performance in some areas is not great. Recommended to play at 80Hz-90Hz. If using 120/144Hz, it is recommended to force Motion Smoothing or equivalent.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>No weather support or day/night cycles,\u00a0only a single time, and weather, and cloud level currently supported.</li><li>Some buildings and areas may look odd, some areas may be higher quality than others. Some third world areas may have strange issues such as monochrome textures.</li><li>No collision with anything. You can fly through terrain.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>No networked finger tracking, only the local player will see their finger tracking.</li><li>Spawning at an airport only puts you in the general area. Zooming in more to the map before selecting an airport will put you closer to the airport.</li><li>No voice chat. It is recommended you use a separate application like Discord to communicate with your friend during multiplayer.</li><li>Clouds may look slightly more jittery for the guest player than for the host (although this may be fixed)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:06:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/100/100ca32aaa4670ab32ae133e0100694c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["disastorm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
