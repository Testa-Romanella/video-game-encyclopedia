{"id": 384215, "slug": "vampire-hunter-vee", "name": "Vampire Hunter Vee", "name_original": "Vampire Hunter Vee", "description": "<p>Vampire Hunter Vee is a passion project of mine. I have loved 2D games since I was a kid in the 80s playing Atari. To this day one of my favorite games is Shinobi III. I also love the older Castlevania's before they became metroid-like, such a Symphony of the Night. I like that game, but I prefer Castlevania, and III and IV, and my favorite is probably Bloodlines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, Vampire Hunter Vee is not just a Castlevania clone. It will be different enough to stand on its own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I built this page in hopes that you will try out the demos, which I will be updating on this page. This gives you a chance to try different mechanics that I am working on and give your feedback.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anything you want to share that might help the game be the best it can be is most welcomed. Thank you for taking a look.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T05:57:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86a/86aee5db0e18a58aeece8e4b8216c41c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Architectus"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
