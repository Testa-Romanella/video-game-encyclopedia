Larger vessels will break through the waves with tremendous force but smaller ships will rock back and forth creating a great experience as you try to combat realistic water physics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Each ship handles differently, some with different controls to master while others may have a sharp difference in acceleration and speed. Every ship contains a highly detailed bridge for you to explore in first person mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Included is a detailed Mission editor which allows players to adjust wave height, create a selection of triggers and spawn AI ships.
