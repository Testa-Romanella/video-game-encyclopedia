To use this you must have one of those headsets.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is an experience similar to Oculus Dreamdeck, so expect about 5-20 minutes of gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRight now there are 8 fractals. A code editor is included which will allow users to create their own fractals/shaders and share them with the community. More fractals might be added in later updates as well.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere is a free demo available with one fractal and no editor that should give you a pretty good jist of what to expect.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a5/4a5c6a667061aea09d77d688dad9b89b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phylliida"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Phylliida"], "esrb_rating": null}
