I'm Imilkowski Dev, I have a YouTube channel, and this is my small project I'v been working on :)</p>\n<p>This is a 2 players,\u00a0stickman fighting game where you fight with melee-only weapons. The goal is simple - be better than your opponent and win more rounds than him. Unfortunately this game doesn't have a singleplayer mode, so you need to have someone to play with :)</p>\n<p>This game features fancy physics, decent combat and\u00a0satisfying visual effects. I hope you will enjoy the game, although if sth is not going to work or you will encounter a bug, I will sadly not going to fix it because as soon as I'm going to publish this game, I will set off with a new game project :)</p>\n<p>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOCTgbHNPweX6uIHJAX9t3g\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/imilkowski_b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T06:36:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/806/8063e05aaefbf54bbeccf7b6e03a1b2d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Imilkowski Dev"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
