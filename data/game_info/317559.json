You must escape this mine but not before you decide to gather the treasure first. The cart must find the key to unlock this treasure. Once the Key is found the rest is up to the player to make it to the very end.</p>\n<p>On the way to the end of the mine, you must avoid traps, jump over obstacles and climb walls all while holding on to the key. The underground theme works well with the game play because all of the mechanics are simple enough to make it seem realistic for a cart to do. Once you get the Key to the end you unlock the hidden treasure and win the game!</p>\n\n<p><strong>FUNCTIONS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Using the float object, I will create ladders so that the cart can climb up them.</li><li>There will be roadblocks in the game which will be crates that are in the way</li><li>The player also must be quick to react because if you can't keep up the wall, you will fall down and lose the game</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Art: MineTile</p>\n<p>Game Design: Omar Ali</p>\n<p>Game Audio: 8BitFreeDownload</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T06:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d02/d02cd432ff232cb495a63dc7bad20e27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["omarutt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
