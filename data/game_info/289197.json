The UI is still messy at times and the economy might be a tad unbalanced. Feel free to leave feedback. Writing the alien quirks and spiriting the furniture was fun, other than that I spend half the time with working on the UI and it didn't even turn out good. :o If you want a better jam game play my last years entry. :p I like that better at least.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23a/23ae41e8d422a7276391cf08fd201186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["sleeper_games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
