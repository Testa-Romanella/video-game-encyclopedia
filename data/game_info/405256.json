They took over the dungeon, locked the doors and beat you up. You wake up in the lower levels of the dungeon, weaponless, with one mission: warn the Dungeon Master before it's too late.</p>\n<p>In Dungeneer, you play as a dungeon janitor fighting for what is right. Take your broom, your bucket and your keys and smash your way to victory!</p>\n<p>*********************</p>\n<p>ALL PROCEEDS GO TO STUDENT GRANTS for Quebec's Conservatoire de musique du Qu\u00e9bec (https://www.conservatoire.gouv.qc.ca/english/) students.</p>\n<p>Since it all started by a silly project and awesome students that played LIVE orchestral music for the game, all proceeds go to encourage the next generation of composers and musicians.</p>\n<p>*********************</p>\n<p>ONGOING BOUNTY!<br/>2x 100+$<br/></p>\n<p>World record bounty.</p>\n<p>On April 30th 2020, 23h59 EST the holders of the world records (fastest time) in these two categories will receive the bounty.

When I first started it in... 2016? it was made with one intent in mind: make a complete game with 0$! ALL assets (excluding the main character and its weapons and the tracks composed and played by Quebec's Conservatoire de musique students) are either creative commons or public domain (mostly found on https://opengameart.org/ ). I didn't touch the game in like two years because of other projects, but now it's time to release it after some patches and do something with it since it's actually decent. Play it for free or donate to award grants to Quebec's Conservatoire de musique students and claim the world record!</p>\n\n<p>PS: Request the game on https://www.speedrun.com \u00a0so it's officially added faster :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T05:15:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/534/534fdb5a0de80711697bc79a61884e4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zorlock-Oakbite"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
