If the game appears frozen, it is possible the \"Detail\" setting may be too high.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- WASD movement</p>\n<p>- Spacebar to jump/swim-up</p>\n<p>- Hold Alt to swim down</p>\n<p>- Shift to Sprint</p>\n\n<p>Options:</p>\n<p>- Seed: Any string of characters that will determine the world generation. Leave blank for random.<br/></p>\n<p>- Size: Determines the radius of the planet<br/></p>\n<p>- Detail: Determines the subdivision multiplier for the planet. Suggested to not go above 4, as higher settings may cause the generator to crash.<br/></p>\n<p>- In the Pause Menu: \"/seed\" will print out the Seed String for the current world.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Future updates will include more diverse land structures, environments, and flora. Eventually, I will develop AI fauna, NPC characters, NPC civilizations. My end goal is to develop a story that will weave all of this together into a fully developed story game.</p>\n\n\n<p>Share this Game:https://99thnehemiah.itch.io/procedural-planet</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T07:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd9e0d61a9b9f1c7aa8b7b7b4524e68a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nehemiah Turner"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
