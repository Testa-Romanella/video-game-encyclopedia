The pace of the big city is like clockwork.<br/><br/>It is now up to you to unleash chaos \u2013 as a seemingly innocent German Shepherd. Take control and attack unsuspecting dogs, cats, humans. In this virtual city, no police force is going to stop you. The animal control people have also taken a step back in this game.<br/><br/>There are many targets in the urban environment. Attack as many as possible to rack up the points and meat (I mean meet) your goals.<br/><br/>In these mean streets, you\u2019ll also find power ups. Gain strength and speed to do even more damage \u2013 faster.<br/><br/>Detailed 3D graphics give this game attitude and life. Just hit play and be a dog for a day, or a few minutes.
