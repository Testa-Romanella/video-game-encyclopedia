This aim trainer was made to end the game once the player loses all 3 lives. A life is lost when the player fails to click on a target before that target disappears. At the start of the game this should only take the objects 3 seconds to decay, however once the player has achieved a score of 1000, then the objects start to decay much faster.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T11:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da0/da0200e3c6037c4aa9be10e49ad5c8ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brandonhunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
