It is somewhat held up by the fact that there are things wrong with the day (Quantum Leap idea) and he needs to fix it before he can continue to tomorrow. At the same time, he uses this to gain knowledge of his love interest and say the right things to get her to like him.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam and I only stated learning game development about 6 months ago. Wanted to add lots more people to help or punish, some flesh eating Groundhogs to fend off that could be a random obstacle for the timed objectives, then perhaps more days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:51:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a2ec2325a1aa7ee5a3a3925f85983a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruling Spear"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
