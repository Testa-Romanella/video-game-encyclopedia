To use  the grapple hook use the mouse and right click at a given spot on the  rock areas around the player to grapple(note you must hit a physical  spot on the rock for the grapple to work. once grapple is enabled the  player can use WASD and jump to maneuver with the grapple hook to swing  around the obstacles. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>\r\nQuestions We would like answered\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. does the cool down on the grapple hook make the game play more enjoyable?</p>\n<p>2. How should we approach showing the lava relative to the player in the HUD? should it be a visual or just a number saying how close the lava is?</p>\n<p>3. At some point the speed of the lava becomes so fast that the grapple hook cant shoot fast enough to overcome the speed of the lava. Should we decrease the cool down of the grapple hook as time goes on to counter balance the speed of the lava?<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T18:58:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e8/6e8b7216684113d30a0ac79e4026a83f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Ogden"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
