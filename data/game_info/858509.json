Every time you look over at their home, they\u2019re often standing still. Sometimes they\u2019re flat-out watching your house. That\u2019s pretty creepy, but you have a buttload of work to do! Balance out the day app-testing and praying that your neighbor <em>stays in one place.</em></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p>- 13.5k word count</p>\n<p>- a neighbor that watches you</p>\n<p>- a math minigame (no, seriously)</p>\n<p>- your new house to explore</p>\n<p>- multiple endings</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was a project I finished long ago, but kept trying to rewrite and redo because I kept thinking that I could do more with it. However, I've realized that the scope of what I wanted was just too big and I've decided to leave it the way it is. I admit that there are flaws, but I want to move on and work on different projects in the future, so this might be as far as I'll take this game, aside from bug fixes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T11:59:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c7/2c7f26c43d0e16d74040abfc3c45e384.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PV Scylla"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
