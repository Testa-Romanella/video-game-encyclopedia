The theme for this jam was \"Only One\".\u00a0 Vortex Evac is a\u00a0\"Single-Stick\" Shooter, where the player only has one projectile at their disposal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The objective is to destroy the capital ship that is assaulting the station.</p>\n<p>When the projectile is shot, an opposite force is applied to the player. This is how the player moves. The projectile then returns to the player to be fired again. The player is effectively defenseless while the projectile is in flight, as it is their only means of defense and mobility.</p>\n<p>To destroy the capital ship, the player will have to balance precise movement with well timed attacks all while repelling hordes of aliens!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T22:53:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/986/9864cbbdbcb33f5c36193b11d87c37ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MichaelBer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
