In the end, we really do live in different worlds. I've come to understand that now. I'm sorry, Tomoki.\"<br/><br/>That was how we broke up.<br/>I wonder how many years had passed after we'd entered university when it happened? It really came out of the blue.<br/>That was the last thing that happened between us.<br/><br/>Several years passed by.<br/>I was an employee at a mid-sized company.<br/><br/>It was just another day...<br/>The former president decided to step down and let the vice president succeed him. <br/>The vice president was the president\u2019s son. He was genuinely a diligent and pleasant guy. On top of that, he was intelligent and handsome, but he let it get to his head. He was friendly man who despite being the vice president, he took an active role in the grunt work.<br/>He had a nice personality, he was kind, and everyone responded well to him.<br/>To be honest, I liked the guy, too. <br/>That was the man who was suddenly appointed to be our new president after his father who started having health issues.<br/>I was fine with that.<br/><br/>\"I am Shiho Kamiya. I am delighted to make your acquaintance.\"<br/><br/>That\u2019s what the woman standing beside our new president said.<br/>While I clapped as the others did, my heart was pounding.

I couldn't think of it as anything but a nightmare.<br/><br/>And my premonition turned out to be quite accurate.<br/><br/>After she had taken charge of accounting, the company changed. <br/>She was strict with management of necessary expenses, cracked down on the acceptance of receipts, and kept a constant eye on our activities.<br/>Naturally, the employees weren't pleased. But not only was the manager, the PRESIDENT'S WIFE, she was efficient, thorough, and productive. She was a shining example for the other employees in the company, so no one could say anything or go against her.<br/>But in the end, even if they understood it on an intellectual level, you couldn't help but feel an unconscious sense of dissatisfaction. <br/>And I too, was among those who harbored such frustrations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T04:06:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa06cde9581ca13754870525f738caec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Appetite"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["MangaGamer"], "esrb_rating": null}
