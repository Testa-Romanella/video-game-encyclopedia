I'm not proud of my time management and the scope of my game. But hey, at least I made something. I still hope you enjoy my game despite its flaws.</p>\n\n<p>In this box puzzle adventure, you play as a robot malfunctioning due to a missing piece of code. The goal is to trap yourself,\u00a0 making it impossible to complete the level. I was inspired by the way's people were able to trap themselves in the game Portal and so I created a whole game based around that concept.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>W/A/D - Movement</li><li>Mouse - Grabbing and moving boxes</li><li>Esc - Close Game</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T15:24:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/623/6239f5f4b358e595bc3e523a13219f2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JACBoy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
