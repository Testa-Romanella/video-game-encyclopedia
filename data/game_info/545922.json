How deep can you go?</p>\n<p>When I say \"roughly\", I really mean <strong>roughly</strong>. You play as Professor Lidenbrock and start your journey at the Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull in Iceland, and that's about it. I don't think there are any giant spiders in the book (or in Iceland), and don't expect to see any of the locations mentioned in it, it just goes down and down and down... I planned to have dinosaurs in it, but didn't get to making them.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:41:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff4/ff465a86c3381394232ae031df265585.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FeuerTiger86"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
