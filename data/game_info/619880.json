They want to become the best sandwich ever! They don't always see eye to eye on everything, but they always manage to turn it around in the end!</p>\n<p>You play as Peebs, freshly launched from the toaster. And since Jammy is being stubborn (as usual!), it's your goal to match up your pose with Jammy's. The closer you match the pose, the more Freshness your sandwich will have! The game continues until you've run out of Freshness.</p>\n\n<p>My entry to the GMTK 2021 game jam. Despite being the main mechanic, I couldn't fix a bug with the posing mechanic. If it helps, imagine the angle between the horizontal line facing right - think back to high school math classes. I'll try to fix it for a V1.2 release, but don't hold your breath.</p>\n\n<p><strong>V1.1 UPDATE:\u00a0</strong>Nothing big, just added a single line to speed the player up after each attempt. Technically this was made after the jam deadline (something came up last minute for me), so play the V1.0 if you're that picky about it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T16:31:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1b/d1b307cf6df513a1dbb41750c3e952a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["NickHenley"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
