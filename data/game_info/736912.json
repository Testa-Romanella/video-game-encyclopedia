Challenge was to tell a story and not use any art. \u00a0I will be honest and say the story is a bit whack but it\u2019s what I ran with to get something put together in a limited time. \u00a0You play as a game idea eventually maturing into a game?</p><p>Good luck!</p>\n<p>WASD to move.\u00a0 Navigate through a story describing the Game Idea's Journey from \"figment\" to fully realized game.</p>\n<p>Avoid the naysayers, bugs, and other challenges!</p>\n<p>The following were areas I focused on from a Game Dev learning perspective with this jam:</p>\n<p>-Using the Construct 3 ProUI Plugin for UI elements and control of dialog boxes and other elements.</p>\n<p>\u2014Plugin:\u00a0https://aekiro.itch.io/proui</p>\n<p>-Maintaining arrays of dialogue for different scenes and presenting it to the player so you can go forward or backward through your scene.</p>\n<p>-Incorporating voice over audio. \u00a0I had access to a great audio pack through an Asset bundle I had purchased previously.</p>\n<p>\u2014Asset Pack:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/voices/game-character-voice-bundle-133901</p>\n<p>-Continuing to make use of and get comfortable with\u00a0my lighting effect (which is a gamble! I have had some users / bugs depending on OS or device where the positioning is off. \u00a0If you have this problem, please let me know if you are using a MAC)<br/></p>\n<p>\u2014My C3 Procedural Lighting Effect:\u00a0https://foozlecc.itch.io/procedural-lighting-effect</p>\n<p>The story itself is inspired by the typical \u201cHero\u2019s Journey\u201d plot arc.</p>\n<p>I would have continued maturing it but we just our baby arrive! So game dev is on pause for a bit.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p>Cheers-</p>\n<p>FoozleCC</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:54:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c819de653bc9b6cc870fe26fbe2d46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FoozleCC"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
