Decided to take a short cut through a small out of the way, run down road to reach the main road, a bug hit me in my face. Then someone on a bicycle nearly hit me, then shortly after came a car down this barely-wide-enough for one person, let alone a car road. So I came up with the idea of an \"infinite runner\" bullet hell, with random monsters and bosses spawning periodically!\u00a0</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Z - Shooting</li><li>X - Bombing</li><li>Shift - Focused / Slowed Movement</li><li>ESC - Pausing / Menu Cancellation</li><li>SPACE - Menu Selection</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>See how far you can get each run!\u00a0Once you die, you'll have an oppertunity to upgrade the player / game experience and a chance to get even further.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u203b  Due to this being made during a weekend while working a full time job for one of the days, I\u00a0could only do a handful of monsters / upgrades. In the future I plan on updating / continuing development and I'll add a ton of extra stuff!\u00a0</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming, enemy sprites, bullet sprites were done by me!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music, particle effects, and the background were either royalty free or purchased in the past.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music : Juhani Junkala [SubspaceAudio]\u00a0(https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action)</p>\n<p>Background:\u00a0Ansimuz (https://opengameart.org/content/forest-background)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T18:56:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d2601c3e859d4c0b706df6e52020e0eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nick H."], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
