You look at the stock and your quest begins. This is the premise behind Fetch(working title). You are working as the stockcat to fetch the items needed for those oh so wonderful customers! The items just so happen to be drops from monsters that live in the backroom. Beat them to a pulp with your trusty broom and try and purchase HP and Inventory upgrades with your hard earned coins!</p>\n<p>This is just the first level and an alpha of what you can expect if you follow along with Fetch's development. The plan is to have you grab items from different floors as things get harder.</p>\n<p>Please leave me some feedback! I apologize for the lack of sounds, I thought of adding in some chiptune placeholders but it really didnt gel with me for the moment. I hope you can forgive me</p><p>Update _1</p><p>-Fixed Knockback issue of getting you turned around and made it a little less wonky</p><p>-Added a notice by the drop box, wasn't as intuitive as I thought<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:56:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/25082b97de10ab688da2967289f770a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spiral Mouse"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
