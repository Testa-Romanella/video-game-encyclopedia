Originally from the Varooom 3D project page.<br/></p>\r\nObjective\r\n<p>The game's objective is to match the Number in the Center (Known as the Center Number) with the Target Number displayed on top, and later moved to the bottom left-corner. The Center Number is in Hexadecimal and may over-or-under flow (i.e. 255 -&gt; 0 and vice-versa).</p>\n<p>You can shoot your Bullets by Pressing A, they are used to destroy and catch Enemies and Modifiers, respectively. Enemies will give you extra time if you destroy them and there are Enemy variations.</p>\n<p>You are also showered with Modifiers that when caught, are stored into the Modifier Slots. If you have gotten both Operators (+/-/\u00d7/\u00f7) and Numbers in their slots respectively (as seen in the bottom-right corner), You can press B to input and modify the value of the Center Number, You may also overwrite the existing Modifiers in the slots by capturing other ones.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left and Right Pads - Move Ship</p>\n<p>A - Shoot Bullet</p>\n<p>B - Input Modifiers</p>\n<p>Start - Pause or Start Game</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming by:\u00a0\u00a0Kaleidosium</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by: kathound</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>- exelotl, along with PyroPyro for Natu and XNIQ's code</p>\n<p>- Jeti for the fonts used or derived</p>\n<p>- Jonathan So\u00a0for <em>The Game Creator's Pack</em>, used temporarily during development</p>\n<p>- Mark Brown for the <em>Developing</em> series</p>\n<p>- Justburner for some minor math help</p>\r\nSource Code\r\n<p>The source code can be found on GitHub in our organization here:\u00a0https://github.com/EigenlightArts/HEXES, It is licensed under the permissive MIT License.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T07:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddd/ddd971cd300f11406f7cd1c6c8233a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Dania Rifki"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
