Find the Four Medallions and Get Out.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This project has multiple levels to it, but because of Itch's file size limit, I'm forced to upload\u00a0these levels as stand alone games... So more levels coming. Also, this whole project has\u00a0been more of a learning process for myself, which is why these levels will be free to download. If you like it, or you hate it, let me know in the comments. Any criticism you may have will be greatly appreciated!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, any of you Game Developers playing this, hit me with your\u00a0criticisms as well. Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T13:54:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/418/418e73cdbe007896552688cf44595806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 294, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["3_Beams_Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
