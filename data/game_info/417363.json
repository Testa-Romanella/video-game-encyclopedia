{"id": 417363, "slug": "puzzlepath", "name": "PuzzlePath", "name_original": "PuzzlePath", "description": "<p>Build stages yourself with random falling blocks, then run and jump across your creations to the goal! It's the first platformer where the difficulty setting is your own puzzle-solving skill.<br/></p>\n<p>PuzzlePath is both a falling block puzzle and platforming game\u00a0\u2014 one of the most ambitious crossovers in history. Not only does this make it a direct MCU competitor, but it means that your resourcefulness with random block spawns and foresight in building feasible levels will be your greatest tools.</p>\n<p>In each stage, you'll be tasked with placing blocks in a Tetris-like format, then you'll harness your inner plumber to jump across said blocks. Only certain block combos will remain solid for the platforming phase, so what will you do if you find yourself accidentally piling up\u00a0ineffective blocks? Will you risk adding to the pile in hopes of creating a platform at the right spot, or will you start placing blocks further away and increase the gap you'll have to jump? Choices like this are common as a time-crunched level designer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Legendary Tale Awaits You</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is no slouch in the narrative department. You'll play as Builder Baby, a young and aspiring\u00a0construction worker who just\u00a0built an apartment building by himself. As he's about to leave for the day, he realizes that he needs to grab his wallet that he left behind the building. But before he gets the chance, the whole apartment building collapses! It leaves a\u00a0bottomless chasm\u00a0between him\u00a0and the wallet. Builder Baby will have to use his magical falling block construction abilities to cross the chasm, but that's no easy feat when he's being hunted\u00a0by the apartment building's vengeful ghost.</p>\n<p>Excitement, joy, friendship, and even tears\u00a0\u2014 all these things will grip you along this memorable adventure. Be ready, because you'll be so captivated that you'll forget\u00a0there isn't actually\u00a0any story content past the beginning cutscene.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lots of Blocks</strong></p>\n<p>Permanent platforms are created when you get at least three blocks of the same color to touch. Arranging the blocks you're given into a winnable level will be your challenge.</p>\n<p>As you progress in the game, you'll come across blocks that possess special properties as platforms. Some will move side-to-side, some will vanish when stepped on, and some will have issues staying tangible. You'll be making important choices about which block types should go where.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Creator's Note</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is my first game, so I apologize about bugs you may find. If you find any, please feel free to comment about them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had an exciting time making this game. There aren't many things\u00a0more satisfying than creating your own world from scratch, and that inspires me to keep making more games down the line. With that said, I hope you have fun with this first one, and may the random blocks spawn in your favor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:55:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/824/824899e116a978c45ac1981112f2e389.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Decent Pretzel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
