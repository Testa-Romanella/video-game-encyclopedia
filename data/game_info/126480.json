Theme: Shapeshift</p><p>Fight back against boredom as you face down against waves of doodles in your school notebook! Enemies are attacking from up high, down low, and in between; you'll have to transform between three different heroes to keep the evil horde at bay. Battle for a high score as you shapeshift and shoot to hold off the baddies for as long as you can. <br/><br/>--Controls-- <br/>A / J ..........Become Giraffe (to attack high enemies) <br/>S / K ..........Become Human (to attack mid enemies) <br/>D / L ..........Become Creature (to attack low enemies) <br/>F / Space ......Fire <br/><br/>If the enemies reach you, you die. Sorry. <br/><br/>Take your shots carefully! If you fire and miss all enemies, you'll get a strike. Three strikes and you're shooting privileges will be revoked. <br/><br/>Successive kills will increase your score multiplier. Miss a shot, and it goes back to 0. <br/><br/>Leave your high score in the comments to see who is the best doodle destroyer of Ludum Dare! <br/><br/>------------------------------------- <br/><br/>This has been my fourth Ludum Dare, and my third time finishing. I focused a lot more on art this time, so while my gameplay is more simplistic, I'm happy with the amount of animation work I was able to get done in a weekend. <br/><br/>Please leave any and all feedback, and if you run into bugs I will try to track them down. Looking forward to playing everyone else's games! <br/><br/>------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Engine: Unity <br/>Code: C# <br/>Art: Adobe Flash and Photoshop <br/>Background Music: FakeMusicGenerator and Audacity <br/>SFX: bfxr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/45168fa2f930eb342d7d2c804746ebcd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["CarlsonAndPeeters"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
