In this alternative 1960s England, conformity is key. You\u2019ll have to fight or blend in with the drug-addled inhabitants, most of whom don\u2019t take kindly to people who won\u2019t abide by their not-so-normal rules.\n\nDiscover the retrofuturistic city\u2019s dark history as you play through the intertwined narratives of three quietly rebellious citizens of Wellington Wells. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses as they face their pasts, prepare for the future, and engage in activities that aren\u2019t exactly status quo in the artificially enthused society.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970e02b2c78fc815f950190861471975.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Xbox One"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
