The artwork reminds us that fantasy without reason produces impossible monsters, but united they give birth to marvelous creations.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Spell of Reason (Produces Monsters)</em>, a game artistically inspired by Goya's piece, you will traverse dreamlike landscapes  interacting with Fantasy, Reason and their products using different weapon-like artifacts. But watch out, because your attacks have downsides...<br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay notes<br/></p>\n<ul><li>This game plays as a first-person shooter and requires a certain familiarity with the genre. Having said so, I would not call it difficult, especially due to its brevity.</li><li>Although the story can be completed in a short time, the game includes an endless mode.</li></ul>\n<p>Technical note<br/></p>\n<ul><li>If you are experiencing overheating issues, try activating VSync in the options or pause menu.</li></ul>\n<p>Artistic note<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Goya's etching suggests rich, complex meanings. Diverse analyses can be found on the internet, while the author's own life and other works can shed more light or shadows on his piece. I do not claim to know Goya's intentions fully, as I would not even claim that there is only one way to play and understand my own game.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:36:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/362/362337af8f069fb8f4c28f82965bec81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polybiak"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
