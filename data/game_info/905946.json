The hardworking Libyan people are struggling, but hopeful about their future.</p>\n<p>You are a middle-aged farmer living in a small town, tending to your community while working at a nearby irrigation plot. Your main products are potatoes, carrots, and other ingredients, which you regularly sell at the local market.</p>\n<p>You recently lost your partner to heart disease, due to lack of preparation and shortages in healthcare supplies. This led you to focus on a singular goal: make it through the year without succumbing to health problems or going into debt.</p>\n<p>Life is hard, but you are determined to pull through. One decision at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Advice and core mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>Although the Great Man-Made River irrigates your fields, it\u2019s not enough to guarantee a stable income. Here\u2019s what you need to know:</p>\n<p>Basic:</p>\n<p>- Your goal is to survive a year (365 days). The game is over if your health drops to 0</p>\n<p>- There are four main stats: energy, happiness, health, and community</p>\n<p>- Energy is used to perform tasks, while the other three track wellbeing</p>\n<p>- At the end of each day:</p>\n<p>- Your energy is replenished to equal your happiness</p>\n<p>- The other three stats decrease by one or more</p>\n<p>- One unit of food and water is consumed; running out will have adverse effects on health and happiness</p>\n<p>Intermediate:</p>\n<p>- The core crux of the game is to balance your immediate needs with support for the future</p>\n<p>- The main actions have short-term benefits, but you can\u2019t survive the end of the year without some upgrades</p>\n<p>- Low health increases chance of illnesses, which cause a sudden drop of 10 health</p>\n<p>- The crops are watered by center-pivot irrigation, providing a steady supply each month</p>\n<p>- You can improve the available supply for the next months, or harvest to gain ingredients from the existing supply</p>\n<p>- Any unharvested crop at the end of the month withers and is unused</p>\n<p>- Education allows you to become more time-efficient; trained actions will consume more energy but convert much more value per action</p>\n<p>Advanced:</p>\n<p>- The market prices change with supply, and are randomized at the end of each week as traders bring new goods and buy others</p>\n<p>- Happiness usually drops by 1/day.
