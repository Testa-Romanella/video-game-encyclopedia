I figured a simple one-button game I could develop using the fantasy console Pico-8 would be a great starting point. It's been a great experience so far and although I'm pretty satisfied with the core gameplay, I might come back later and update the game with some extra juiciness. (Although it may be a while, I'm already burnt out doing all the sprite work. Nobody told me there would be this much sprite work!)</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was made completely be myself, though obviously credit goes to Dong Nguyen, the original creator of Flappy Bird for the inspiration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, a shoutout to Zep and the rest of the team at Lexaloffle Games for making the fantasy game console Pico-8 which made my work in programming, art, and sound much more enjoyable.\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/</p>\n<p>Lastly a huge thanks goes to Krystian of Lazy Devs whose tutorial videos and passion for game development helped tremendously in getting me started!\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdT68dsulMFouI2InvXWM5w</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:26:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bff/bffd4f423286bbe6f93d7da85c4717b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["TheRetroPaul"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
