Once you're in, you creep through their corridors, ambushing guards, hiding bodies, stealing new weapons, blowing them up from the inside, or hijacking their turrets and even the whole ship.<br/><br/><ul><li>Zoom smoothly from a view of the whole galaxy down to your character sneaking up on guards inside the spaceship you're boarding.<br/></li><li>All seamless: the ship you're on continues to fly around the galaxy as you sneak about inside, even as it gets into ship battles.<br/></li><li>Full modular destruction of every spaceship: shoot a fuel barrel to blow up the room and be flung into space by the vacuum. Rip ships in half, destroy secure rooms to form new entrances to dock at.<br/></li><li>Procedurally generated, from the shape of the galaxy, the trade routes between empires, the shape of every ship, and even the layout of the corridors inside.<br/></li><li>Be a bounty hunter, an assassin, a saboteur, or a hijacker. Earn money from your missions to buy better kit. That kind of thing.<br/></li><li>Lovely spacey music.</li></ul>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2017-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:03:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/658/658ee56f04d522faffc4d6009842b07d.jpg", "website": "http://spaceships.cool", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 34, "owned": 616, "beaten": 26, "toplay": 16, "dropped": 54, "playing": 12}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 68, "ratings_count": 94, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 94, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Suspicious Developments"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Suspicious Developments"], "esrb_rating": null}
