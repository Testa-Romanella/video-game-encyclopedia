But what happens to those memories that are lost during this process? Do they fade away never to be recalled again? Are they just filed into a different part of the brain that we do not yet know how to access? Do we really have memory at all, or is this all just a running simulation controlled by the machines that harvested our bodies as a power source? Of course not. These memories are collected and cataloged in The Mausoleum of Memory.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p><em>The Mausoleum of Memory</em> is an adventure locale\u00a0for Troika!, the Other World's favorite fantasy RPG. The Mausoleum is a place <em>between</em> the spheres that one may visit on their travels across humpbacked sky. But wait, there's so much more! Included within the confines of a pair of mini-zines are the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Details on what one may find in The Mausoleum.</li><li>Loose goals to draw your intrepid party of adventurers in and connect them to a larger narrative structure (I know, I know, quite clever indeed).</li><li>A micro sized depthcrawl suitable for a session of play (who needs to spend hours just to prep an adventure when you can generate it at the table?).</li><li>A bestiary, with 6 new potential adversaries (or friends, as I have no tangible control over how you use them. Just know that I'll know.).</li><li>Some interesting ways to mess with your player's characters (with their explicit consent of course).</li></ul>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Instruction on the assembly of the mini-zine can be found here if arts and crafts are your thing. If not, the Folio Editions have been conveniently arranged for screen viewing.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>\n\n<p><em>The Mausoleum of Memory</em> is an independent production by Josh Domanski and is not affiliated with the Melsonian Arts Council.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T10:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d1/6d19dbd220975b936aa7464e0e666121.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unenthuser"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
