Days are spent meeting your own needs as you work to the goal of a retirement (see: death) at the ripe old age of 100. To get there, you <em><strong>harvest</strong></em> (five)\u00a0<strong><em>ingredients</em></strong> and combine them in an ancient tradition to produce <em><strong>years</strong></em>.</p><p>Life outside the hive complex can be dangerous after nightfall though; most folk spend their nights engaged in whatever\u00a0<em><strong>work</strong></em>\u00a0at hand\u00a0interests them, often in exchange for additional years. Occasionally, these may influence the larger community around them, and lead to shifts in the political power of the hive's <strong><em>parties</em></strong>\u00a0(for the current version of the game, you begin with one in power\u00a0(<strong><em>sure</em></strong>), and two more - <strong><em>The 100%</em></strong> and <strong><em>US</em></strong>\u00a0- \"us\"\u00a0as in \"this is for us\")<em>.</em>\u00a0And given that\u00a0 policies enacted\u00a0by whichever party is in power are able to directly affect behaviour of citizens...everyday life sometimes gets a just a little\u00a0bit more complicated.<br/></p><p><strong>Plans for post-jam: </strong>Once voting for the game jam is done I'm looking forward to expanding on party mechanics,\u00a0fully flesh out two more parties, make (nighttime) working restrictable by parties so that getting involved in politics becomes more necessary, and address a bunch of balance issues in general. Also add some art and make it look a bit nicer heh :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/572/5729861a5fffad185061da62b158e05a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mithun"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
