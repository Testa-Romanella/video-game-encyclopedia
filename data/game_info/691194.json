{"id": 691194, "slug": "surfline", "name": "Surfline", "name_original": "Surfline", "description": "<p>Use the left and right arrow keys to avoid the rocks!</p>\n<p>Surfline is a game I made in just 3 hours for the Trijam #144. The theme was \"life line\", which also served as an inspiration for my incredibly original title.</p>\n<p>I decided to add a bit to the game which now means that my development time slightly exceeds 3 hours. I have adjusted my submission time accordingly, and I'm certain this is the right decision since the game is much better for it.<br/></p>\n<p>Also, lore explanation: The dark parts of the water are in fact <em>not</em> deeper bits of water, but were <em>always</em> intended to look like shadows from some weird triangular skyscrapers. The reason for this is simply that the surfer is in fact surfing along the (fictional) \"Very-regularly-spaced-triangular-skyscraper Bay\", located in the (also fictional) city of \"Very-similar-looking-rocks-all-over-the-harbour Harbour City\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:34:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b5/3b5ab6e3073bf04271ef0f9ed16eabb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VFuzzius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
