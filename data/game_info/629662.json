Alone with only your lever-action rifle and double barrel shotgun, will you be able to reach the train?</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>MINER MALFUNCTION </strong>is a whiteboxed singleplayer first-person shooter developed as a one-man student project during my graduation year of IGAD.<br/>Starting off as a personal project in my spare time, I made it into a year-long project focused on delivering a reinforced whitebox level for a full, closed-loop FPS game. From the core gameplay and its mechanics to the level design and whitebox art assets, this game was developed by me as sole developer. </p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>HEAVY GUNPLAY:</strong> With a manually operated lever-action rifle and a devastating double barrel shotgun, taking down hordes of enemy robots will prove to be both satisfying and challenging.</li><li><strong>WESTERN TOWN: </strong>Explore a semi-linear old mining town featuring side routes and optional areas, allowing you to choose your approach.</li><li><strong>ROBOTS GONE ROGUE: </strong>Fight against three different kinds of robots, each variation challenging you in different ways.</li><li><strong>TRICK SHOTS: </strong>Get a higher final score by challenging yourself to land headshots and sneak attacks, reduce deaths, and kill all robots!</li></ul>\n<p><strong>DESIGN INSIGHT MODE </strong>is an alternate mode  allowing users to fly through the game, see the level from different angles, and read comments that provide insight into the design process and decision making.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER! This is NOT a 100% finished game, and you will likely encounter bugs and glitches that may impact your experience. Most issues can be fixed by either exiting to main menu and going back into the game, or quitting the game and deleting the save file (DeathMatchShooter\\Saved\\SaveGames\\Save_Default.sav).
