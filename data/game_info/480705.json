However, only one mode can be active at a given time!

In crime break the default play mode is first person movement, but you have to pause the movement to interact with the world. You have to switch between these two modes to complete the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p><ul><li>First Person Movement: \u00a0W, A, S, D + Mouse</li><li>Pause: Esc</li><li>Interact: Left mouse button (While the game is paused)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T06:37:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0d/d0d2064caeb44ce7f2a5d823f0a099e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nupsi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
