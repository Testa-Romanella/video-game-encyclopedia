I want to fill it up.<br/><strong>Nim:</strong> Are you sure that is wise, captain? It might be a good idea if I remain as your lifeguard while you're in the water.<br/><strong>Joachim:</strong> Wise? I wouldn't call any of my decisions wise... I'm just bored out of my mind, Nim! I've gotta do something... So just figure it out alright?  That's an order.<br/><strong>Nim:</strong> Understood, captain.<br/><br/>Robot Island is a narrative-driven game where you play as a robot flight attendant on a space ship. It's only you and the captain though - people aren't taking space vacations these days! Sometimes he asks you to clean things and make him coffee... which is what you were built to do!!<br/><br/>Expect a charming and relaxing romp where you'll be <strong>mostly</strong> reading, choosing dialogue options, and exploring a 3D world from an isometric (like the Sims!) viewpoint. There's lots of little things to look at if you're feeling like doing so... you can talk to plants! But you don't have to. You can plow through the story too - speeeeeeed ruuuuun. Also, the music is good, the sound effects are nice, and it's quite pleasing to look at!<br/><br/>If you like visual novels and games that are mostly about story, you may like this game as well. <br/><br/>Nims are the most popular brand of humanoid robot in the galaxy. You start in a factory where you are activated and told your assignment - flight attendant! After that it's off to the ship where you meet the captain and learn that there are no other passengers. Over the course of 5 days, you and the captain talk about normal stuff. He doesn't like his job very much, and he has trouble opening up... sound familiar!?", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a40/a4094efdf5395463c6f85e55f7524132.jpg", "website": "http://newbeings.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 6, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["New Beings"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["New Beings"], "esrb_rating": null}
