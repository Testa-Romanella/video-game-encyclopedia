Within the gallery, visitors were able to engage with the explorers and discover all of the hidden wonders the world had to offer. Visitors to the experience were able to collect trading cards depicting the explorers and the creatures.</p>\n\n<ul> <li> <p>Engaging, Fascinating and deep. Thank you for an unexpected dip into an alternative reality. It was worth the journey a thousand times over. (Visitor Comment)</p></li></ul>\n<p>In this Explorers Edition, the original gallery piece has been tweaked to provide an explorable landscape to allow audiences to engage with the piece from the comfort of their own home and to especially cater for those who were unable to reach the gallery for a multitude of shielding and accessibility issues during the Summer of 2022. It is an explorable environment filled with things to see and hear; an ambient meditative game experience to relax and enjoy with a generative soundscape that changes each time you play.<br/><br/>Use arrow keys and mouse/trackpad to navigate around the world\u00a0and discover all of the mythical creatures and the explorers that inhabit the world, alongside a plethora of unusual sights and sounds.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a legacy project and as such will receive no further updates at this moment in time.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Arts Council England and Derbyshire County Council for their support of Level Centre and enabling this project.\u00a0https://levelcentre.com/</p>\n\n<p><em>Ashley James Brown</em><br/>Ashley is a digital artist, software developer and educator specialising in creative technology. </p>\n<p>Ashley\u00a0works in collaboration with many cultural organisations, businesses and individual artists to realise their creative potential with technology.\u00a0Ashley\u00a0has over 13 years experience working professionally with a wide variety of cutting edge and non-traditional software and hardware.
