Throughout the zombification process, they progressively lose their capabilities to use their\u00a0weapons:\u00a0At 50% Zombie, the player\u00a0can no longer handle the weight of their trusty shotgun and pulls out their pistol; At 85%, the player\u00a0loses control of both hands, and likewise their pistol,\u00a0therefore must resort to\u00a0scrambling about for a way to regain humanity.</p>\n<p>In order to regain\u00a0humanity, carry out Acts of Humanity\u00a0by finding medication pills or, for example, rescuing a cat that is stuck underneath the wreckage of a car.</p>\n<p>However, when taking damage, instead of losing health, the zombies will instead speed up the zombification process - they are unrelenting in changing the player into one of them, therefore the player must carefully manage their humanity to avoid defeat.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Movement -\u00a0<strong>WASD<br/></strong>Fire -\u00a0<strong>Left Click<br/></strong>Reload -\u00a0<strong>R<br/></strong>Pause -\u00a0<strong>Escape</strong><br/></p>\r\nAxolotl in a Bottle Studio:\r\n<p>Christopher Robertson - Our Star Programmer (also the only programmer)<br/>Benjamin\u00a0Emdon - UI and Level Design<br/>Tabbie Lawson - Environment Artist<br/>Jamie Vodden - Character Artist<br/>Jamie Carnell - Audio and Music</p>\n\r\nOther Credits:\r\n\n<p>Rock Bottom Font by Abas Creative:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/rock-bottom.font<br/>Buffalo Font by Peter Olexa:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/buffalo-2.font<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:06:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e5/4e51258f960292f3842f340707bbb0ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher Robertson", "Zynthful", "Tabbie Lawson", "Benjamin Emdon", "Jamie Vodden"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
