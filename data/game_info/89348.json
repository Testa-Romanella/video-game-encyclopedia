It\u2019s best to try it a few times until you get the hang of it. <br/>The current score can always be seen over the pause button (II). <br/>When all 6 rounds are complete, the game is over and the final score is displayed. <br/>Another Nine-pins party can begin! :) <br/>The number of players, balls per game-round, game-rounds and the computer-enemys(AI) skills can be set before the game starts! <br/><br/>Points and Winner: <br/>For every pin knocked over, the player gets two points. <br/>If all the pins are down, (this is called \u201cfull\u201d or a \u201cstrike\u201d), the player gets five extra bonus points. <br/>If all the pins are knocked down except the one in the middle (the Kingpin), the player bowled a Crown (\"Ring\") and gets ten extra bonus points. <br/>If only the Kingpin falls and all other pins are left standing, the player gets twelve points. <br/>If the player bowls and doesn\u2019t hit any of the pins, that\u2019s called a Poodle and the player gets one point taken away. <br/>The player with the most points wins. <br/><br/>What is Nine-pins? <br/>Nine pin bowling is a sport where a player rolls a ball in one direction at at a controlled speed. <br/>The goal is to knock down the most pins that are standing at the end of the lane. <br/><br/>Suggestions for improvements and Bug Reports: <br/>Customer is King and we really work hard, to make our German Bowling to the best and send you updates with great new Features!
