First contact was made with extraterrestrial life and Earth was brought into the Intergalactic Federation of Life. Earth suddenly found itself as one of the most profitable trade hubs in the solar system with demand for earth's goods and peculiar creations; items like rubber ducks and massage chairs, amongst many other seemingly mundane items, suddenly became highly sought after items offworld.</p>\n<p>You, the player, are Drone #626 of Deep Space Delivery's colony exports, and your job is to process orders as they come in. You will receive collection orders throughout the day for many items including misfiring rockets, Mammoth cubes and kitchen sinks. It is your job to locate these in a timely and appropriate manner, meaning don't drop them! Facility locations include exotic eats, holy housewares, rare resources, and oddworld oddities. Once items are dropped off at the collection point, proceed to the order terminal to receive your next order. Have a nice day, and remember #626, here at Deep Space Delivery, you\u2019re more than just a number.</p>\n<p>Breaks are only permitted between shifts.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong><em>Development Team</em></strong>\n<em><strong>Game Design:\u00a0</strong></em>\n<ul><li>Tyrone Mathlin - Design Lead,\u00a0Programming, Level Design</li><li>Henry Beech - Programming, UI</li><li>Taliesin Charles-Lewis - Programming, Level Design</li><li>Oliver Nutkins-Middleton - Programming, Level Design</li><li>Alvis Zinovjevz - Programming, UI</li></ul>\n<em>Game Art:</em>\n<ul><li>Elizabeth McMorrow - 3D Art</li><li>Charlotte Price - 2D Art</li><li>Bronwen Palmer - 3D Art</li><li>Cameron Damerall - 2D Art</li></ul><p><em>This project was created as part of a second year university brief at the University of South Wales, in association with Tiny Rebel Games.
