The game is quick to win, but also quick to lose, asking for the player to give multiple attempts before they make it to the end.</p>\n<p>And the end is only the beginning. Subsequent playthroughs can be augmented through timers and difficulties, beating each will unlock more files, revealing exactly what happened on this ship. After completing these challenges, a final encounter with the source of all the evil will be unlocked, the fight of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>The average playtime ranges to roughly 4 hours, or more for those who find it particularly difficult. In either case, you'll need quick reflexes, the will to persevere in the face of adversity, and an accurate\u00a0trigger finger if you want to escape this ship.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>CONTENT WARNING</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>Graphic pixel violence ahead</p>\n<p><strong><em>GAMEPLAY WARNING</em></strong></p>\n<p>This game is\u00a0<em><strong>hard</strong></em>.
