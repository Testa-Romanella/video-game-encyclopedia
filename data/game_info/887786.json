{"id": 887786, "slug": "zombie-land-survival", "name": "Zombie Land - Survival", "name_original": "Zombie Land - Survival", "description": "It is a post-apocalyptic game that takes place in 2025 on the soil of the Czech Republic. Maps range from 8km2 to 400km2. The game will have Czech dabing and all captions. It will also be published in English. Then just the subtitles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnreal Engine 5<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe maps are still being worked on, but there is already one to play.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe map will be for 24 to 200 players. From the start of the server, it will take 30 days for the map to start shrinking down to 1km2, but at least 16km2 towards the center of the map. This is where the map stops scaling. When it will be 90 days from the start of the server, the map will shrink to 0.5km2 and this is where the real battle will begin. After the finish, cards, rewards (special boxes) and statistics for the entire game will be distributed. The server is then restarted (wipe maps) and it starts again.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere will be maps in the game: landscape including populated areas. Or forests or barren desert. There will be animals and zombies on the map. A map that shrinks towards the center, so the rest of the map will be infested with virus and radiation. It will be possible to visit the extinct zone again, but only with a spacesuit and a filter. The filter will need to be changed. It's for 10 minutes. In the infested area, special zombie killers will begin to climb to the surface. They will be persistent and fast.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game will have RPG elements with perks.<br/>\r\nThe inventory is adapted to reality.<br/>\r\nThe backpack has a given load capacity and compartments.<br/>\r\nThe character is the same, but thanks to the levels and perks, the carrying capacity can be slightly increased, including health. The character will suffer from diseases, sometimes the player will not take care of him. Including hallucinations and fever.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game will feature cars, motorbikes, helicopters and bikes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe player is thrown into the game by jumping from a plane of his choice.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game there will be Quests, Jumpsquery, Merchants, puzzles, Events, but also Easter eggs. He will go to form Gangs, alliances. There will also be a safe zone in the game. You will be able to respawn only thanks to Airdrop. It flies every 30 minutes. If you die, for example, 3 minutes before the airdrop, you're lucky.<br/>\r\nAnyhow, 3 minutes after Airdrop, you're out of luck. This time can be shortened by having the Clan or a friend throw you a signal grenade for the airdrop. It can be bought or found. But he is more likely to buy it. It will cost less than a rifle but more than a pistol.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fuel in the game will be: Gasoline, Diesel and Ethanol. When you run on gasoline, it will wear out the engine. Because its quality is deteriorating. Diesel wears out the engine less. Ethanol: you can take a farm-farm, grow corn, then harvest it and then make Ethanol from it. Its use does not destroy the engine. The same canola oil.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnything can be grown, including raising animals.<br/>\r\nIt will be possible to have dogs to protect the farm.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is built on Unreal Engine 5 and it will include RayTracing, DLS and 4k image support. 8k is expected in the future. Distinction. It will be released on PC, later on PS5 and Xbox. We are working on technology that will eventually allow all players from the platforms to be connected to one server. Whether you play on PS5 or Xbox or PC. You can all meet on one server. That made the game more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is currently in Early Access and is in Alpha.<br/>\r\nIt is already possible to build in the game. Eat, drink and craft.<br/>\r\nAlternation of day and night. Changeable weather, raining and snowing and blowing. When there's a storm, there's thunder plus lightning and it's with sound. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game has been in the works for the 3 week.<br/>\r\nI will always release at least 2 updates per month.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T05:28:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee8/ee80d14a693b89debd820f77c71bea85.jpg", "website": "https://dingdong.style/?p=group/zls", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FussyCraft"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["FussyCraft"], "esrb_rating": null}
