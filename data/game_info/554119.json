The player needs to shoot and fight against the giant monsters to stay alive. Our game is special in that once the player shoots, bullets will be scattered everywhere. Referring to the theme this year, lost and found, you will lose your bullets while you shoot and you need to find the bullets you just shot in order to shoot again. Hope you enjoy and support the game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This idea has a preliminary world view and story after the event. The size of the development depends on everyone's reaction. I will review and decide after a while, So if\u00a0you like it, please share, leave a message and donate to support! :D</p>\n<p>#action #FPS #Japan #Fireworks #vfx #shooter  #other #adventure</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T08:23:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e37/e3779795c7095cccfdadbaae539c423a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TigerHoo"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
