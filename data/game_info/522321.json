Something small and something to get me started in a more fun way of game development. Please feel free to leave feedback as I will need as much as possible.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In this game you play as a tailor's ghost that is trying to get the shirt buttons to the other side of the level. The theme was 2 buttons, so I have managed to use the theme in 3 possible ways. There are only 2 shirt buttons you have to move to put on the push down buttons while only using 2 keyboard buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy</p>\n\n<p>You can keep tabs on what game jam I'm doing or any updates at\u00a0https://discord.gg/2CNx7Hp\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:54:57", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JACKO4590"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
