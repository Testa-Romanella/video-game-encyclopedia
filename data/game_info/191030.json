Each shape could move, jump scale and rotate. After some testing I decided to remove rotation as a) it was buggy and b) I couldn't think of a way to use it. <br/><br/>Later on I decided to add an energy system, this meant that every action cost some energy, and without that energy you can't 'shapeshift' <br/><br/>Due to time issues I was only able to complete 3 levels and I am disapointed that I could not add more levels with more interesting uses. I am considering doing my first post mortem, although I will likely forget :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c9/2c95d3693671b9f03ce31d48fd430b0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["emilyp"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
