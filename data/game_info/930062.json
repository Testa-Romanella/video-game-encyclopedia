You're nothing but a shadow with a depressing scene behind you. You must adventure through the lands to find out what happened, and where it leads you. Who knows, along the way you may find yourself some friends!</p>\n<p><em>Early Access - This game is meant to be an immersive experience though currently, it's nothing but the first level, which in itself is subject to change. Over the past 2 years, I've been learning to create in Unreal Engine 5 and this is my latest game. I'm only a student who wants to make indie games for everyone to enjoy so please donate if you like what you see and want to see the project finished.\u00a0<br/></em></p>\n<p><strong>When finally\u00a0released\u00a0this\u00a0game\u00a0will\u00a0cost\u00a0\u00a35\u00a0-\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0donate\u00a0\u00a32\u00a0or\u00a0more\u00a0you\u00a0will receive\u00a0the\u00a0final\u00a0game for\u00a0free.</strong></p>\n<p>To find out more, visit my website<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T15:07:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c2/1c22c277d58ed153b5e29fe5faac8923.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["downofwar5000"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
