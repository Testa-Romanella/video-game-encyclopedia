The idea was to make 10 games in 10 different genres in the first 10 days of 2016. Consequently, most of the games here are very simple and relatively unpolished. Still, they were a lot of fun to make and I hope you get some enjoyment out of them. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f08cfed9d8cc3a745c26758488c96f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Matthew VanDevander"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
