However, this takes a toll on the car\u2019s power levels so the car has to collect batteries on what seems to be an infinite road trip to the safe house where the car can spend its time without worrying about the IRS.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tAfter some relaxation time in the safe house, the car ends up upgrading itself with a strafing ability at the sacrifice of acceleration and deceleration which leaves some room for the ability to dash, although that also comes at a price for its Super Extreme Mega Exothermic Nitro system or S.E.M.E.N system for short only has a small amount of power dedicated to it for the car to strafe side to side faster than usual, right after developing the S.E.M.E.N system The IRS discovers the location of the safe house where the car is located once again, so the car is back on the run with it\u2019s newly acquired S.E.M.E.N system the car starts its operation to flee from the IRS once again.\r\n</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p><strong>Code -</strong></p>\n<p>SuperSackBoy200</p>\n<p><strong>Art -</strong></p>\n<p>Ekulam</p>\n<p>SuperSackBoy200</p>\n<p><strong>Music -</strong></p>\n<p>ISTAREINURSOL</p>\n<p><strong>Car designs -</strong></p>\n<p>SuperSackBoy200</p>\n<p>Ekulam</p>\n<p>ISTAREINURSOL</p>\n<p>Toasted_Popcorn</p>\n<p>Jaxon</p>\n<p>The_Bush</p>\n<p>TNTdeath</p>\n<p>tazfantic</p>\n<p>ClayTheHero</p>\n<p>MemesHQ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T04:30:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/998/998865290a06a79c51b0641d0312696b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperSackBoy200"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
