{"id": 949994, "slug": "beyond-these-stars", "name": "Beyond These Stars", "name_original": "Beyond These Stars", "description": "\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>\nFrom city building to RTS, space exploration to ancient history, see more indie strategy, simulation, and RPGs from Hooded Horse.<br/>\n\nRecovering from uncertain times, the Peeps find themselves on the back of Kewa - a lonely Space Whale journeying across the universe. Building a city on the back of a sentient creature comes with its own set of challenges, but as you build your relationship and travel across the galaxy, you'll come across great opportunities for exploration and stable expansion. Meet other species, pursue the needs and wants of your Peeps, and seek the truth about their ancestors, and the Space Whales alike.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Peeps have managed to establish a fledgling settlement on Kewa's back. Now you must grow your civilisation and relationship with Kewa if you are to survive the challenges of the greater universe, navigating the limited space and resources available on Kewa as best as possible. Will you establish massive industries at the expense of your relationship with Kewa, or use Kewa primarily as a home, gathering resources at your settlements when possible instead? Watch out for pollution that upsets Peeps and Kewa alike, and consider approaching city-building in a sustainable way to maintain the happiness of the Peeps without destroying their future. Learn to harness the benefits of each season as Kewa travels closer to and further away from suns, but be wary of seasonal dangers to your survival, and the vagaries of Kewa's desires.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKewa is an intelligent and ancient being, traveling as they please across the randomly generated universe. The Peeps must first build a relationship with Kewa if they wish to influence their travels. Will your decisions be at the cost of Kewa's happiness, ensuring the Peeps are taken care of above all, or will you care for Kewa as well, limiting your exploitation, and potentially upsetting the Peeps as their demands aren't met as often? As the bond grows, you will journey across the galaxy and establish small settlements on planets to access new resources, coordinating the movement of goods from them to Kewa and back. Deciding where to go and who to engage with will determine how the Peeps progress - will you prioritise industrialisation, cultural prosperity, or both hand-in-hand? Besides planets and asteroids, alien races will have mysteries of their own, presenting new opportunities and advancements to your Peeps.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThough Beyond These Stars is primarily a city-builder, asking you to manage the puzzle of limited space, having you juggle access to one resource at the cost of another, or giving you advantages when using specific layouts, your settlements aren't the only things you'll be building. The relationship between the Peeps and Kewa is a crucial aspect of your survivability, and to that end, you'll be concerned with keeping Kewa happy while keeping the Peeps alive. Your approach to sustainability and pollution will further influence how others feel about your Peeps - they all have something to offer, but only to those they like. From additional objectives and their subsequent rewards to new technologies and the doors they open, your progress is determined by the way you treat the world around you. Will you focus on being self-sufficient at the cost of sustainability, or will you prioritise these relationships with others at the cost of your civilisations efficiency and happiness? Success in Beyond These Stars is not simply a matter of exploitation and organisation, but instead, it is a matter of the relationships you nurture, and the symbiotic relationship between your Peeps and the universe around them.\n<br/>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T07:49:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a45f8385594467421ec3d3b22278359c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 551, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Balancing Monkey Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Hooded Horse"], "esrb_rating": null}
