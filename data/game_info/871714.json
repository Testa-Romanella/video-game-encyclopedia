{"id": 871714, "slug": "rendezvous-in-space1", "name": "Rendezvous in Space.1", "name_original": "Rendezvous in Space.1", "description": "<p>** This version of Rendezvous in Space has a more defined particle trail. The premise is the same. Fly forward through the particle trial to find the other ship you are to meet up with. If you leave the particle train you can look around to find it and try again or just hit R to restart. I\u00a0am at the learning stages, but have a lifelong passion for space and hope I\u00a0can work with a company\u00a0or build a space game people can have a bit of fun with and enjoy. Thank you for checking this out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>** New cockpit. It is actually more of a deck instead of just a small cockpit. </p>\n<p>The goal is to find the other ship you have to meet up with to warp out with. Just move forward, and stay in the particle dust field. When you see the ship fly up next to it to warp out.</p>\n<p>-\u00a0 'A' Turn Left\r\n</p>\n<p>- 'D' Turn Right\r\n</p>\n<p>- W Rotate Up\r\n</p>\n<p>- S Rotate Down\r\n</p>\n<p>- Hold Space Bar to increase Acceleration\r\n</p>\n<p>- Hold Left Shift to Decelerate\r\n</p>\n<p>- E to Rotate Right\r\n</p>\n<p>- Q to Rotate Left\r\n</p>\n<p>- Mouse to move your head around\r\n</p>\n<p>- Follow the rings to get to the other ship\r\n</p>\n<p>- Move close to that ship to initiate the cutscene\r\n</p>\n<p>- Will loop back to stat after the cutscene\r\n</p>\n<p>- R will Restart at any point\r\n</p>\n<p>- 'ESC' to Exit the app\r\n</p>\n<p>The first 15 seconds is a scene you cannot control. After that, you are able to move the shit. The gold is to simply move forward to the other ship you will see as you move forward. I\u00a0may change it so the player will have to really navigate at least a decent turn to meet up with the other ship.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-28T08:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9d/f9dc3d56f0be683e23f23562d42225e7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MauroDot"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
