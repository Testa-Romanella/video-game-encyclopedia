There is a player which is a red cube and his goal is to make it to the end without hitting any obstacles in its way. Once you hit an object you will lose the game and restart. The player travels at a high rate of speed making it a challenge. Once you get to the end you will have successfully beaten the game and can restart if you like. Hope you enjoy and have FUN.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-17T03:14:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/439/4398066e7e9714267b6af31e7d366b8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["MueezRiaz24"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
