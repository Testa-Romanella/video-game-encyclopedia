So why not make a game about it? Introducing Puffy Man. It's a\u00a0sidescrolling platformer inspired by the gween donkey about a hero of the same name.\u00a0<br/>Play as\u00a0Puffy Man - the balloon thing -\u00a0as he attempts to stop the evil Red Magician who has used his signature \u201cMake Mean Powder\u201d on the world\u2019s inhabitants. You'll have to\u00a0\u00a0jump, puff, and cute your way through the world to get to him and foil his plans.</p>\n<p>For anyone wondering, yes this was mostly all drawn by hand with a few things accomplished with a little editing (like Check's animations and\u00a0Dark Puffy).\u00a0Would not recommend doing this if your somewhat new like me (it's an absolute pain).<br/></p>\n\n<p>Notice: I'm planing to take a break from this for about a year or so to get better at game making and am planning to change directions (unless a lot of people are happy with the main gimmick)\u00a0when I come back to it. I am considering adding 1 more level OwO and a trailer. Sorry about the numerous little imperfections like the seams in the tiles\u00a0and the results screen being so barren. As much as I would love to spend a few days fixing those things this was made for a long term school project so I had to go with the flow sometimes. \u00a0Also: I currently don't have a true Windows/Linux port (yeah I've got a Mac sue me) so Windows users (sorry no plans for Linux port)\u00a0will have to put up with the choppy but still playable Flash version (dun dun). \u00a0whew that was a\u00a0mouthful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e4/6e4ef67e3fc0b5dac425fe5bcce6ec55.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NerdinaNutshell"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
