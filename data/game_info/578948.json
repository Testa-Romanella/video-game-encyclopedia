I can change it later.) It's a casual/puzzle mobile game that you can combine three or more same valued tiles to make more valued tiles and get more score. If you combine fives it also combines the tiles nearby itself.</p>\n<p>I'm just interested in coding and I don't have any art skills, so in demo there is no remarkable things about art. If you want to help me about this you can contact me freely.\u00a0 (Contact info is in my account.)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!
