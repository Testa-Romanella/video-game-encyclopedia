Create colorful circuits, build integrated circuits from simple gates, or even create your own microprocessor. The only limit is your imagination!</p>\n<p>Hardware Simulator was created from an interest in electronics. The desire was reinforced after taking a hardware class where complex circuits were shown to be created using basic parts. Unfortunately, curious cats and a small apartment are not conducive to building circuits. The challenge to replicate the experience using Unity was fun and, finally, a 2D hardware simulator is here for all to enjoy!</p>\n<p>*This game has educational application, but at this time it is not intended to teach the user about hardware circuitry concepts. There are more mechanics we want to implement in future updates, but they are not our immediate priority.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T05:33:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ad/4adaae73aad136f76e7aec4ddc19877d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LoneZGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
