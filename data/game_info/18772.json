It is best experienced in a dark room, alone, while wearing headphones.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAbandoned by your friends, you leave for the day to tear up a new part of the mountains on your quad bike. It feels good to be outdoors. The wind whipping past makes you feel alive. You weave between the sparse trees. Then, a harsh pain across your chest. There was a cable tied between those last two trees! The bike keeps going, but you are stopped mid-air. Then you fall into darkness. You wake up dazed. There is a woman outside digging...but digging what? It doesn't feel right. You have to get out of here!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDiscover the secrets of the town of Erusal, escape a horrible maniac, and get spooked by this epistolary horror.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d17366758fbf7de9c77fbdfd1d4054.jpg", "website": "http://spacewedgiegames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 39}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Space Wedgie"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Space Wedgie"], "esrb_rating": null}
