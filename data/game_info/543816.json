So that was a challenge. Before making this game, I implemented some ragdolls in my main project Windshire, so I wanted to stick with some physics.</p>\n<p>But again, making a game centered around nothing can be pretty difficult. I\u00a0went through multiple ideas, but none of them felt like they fit the theme I had in mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0took the project into an artistic approach and realized that the entire map can be nothing, but as you attempt the levels, you paint the background using the balls that are attached to you. Going in this direction, I thought of different gameplay elements, but platforming just felt right. So I decided to go in that direction.</p>\n<p>You start off with some tutorial levels, and the last few levels get into what the game was supposed to be. You have no platforms, just you and the balls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your ability to bounce off your own balls allows you to gain\u00a0greater heights, and as you bounce, you leave a trail behind you. This leans into the artistic side of the game, where the map starts off as white, but you have the ability to paint whatever you want as you go through the level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This is a difficult game</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>So I\u00a0guess this is technically SOMETHING, but hey you can't make a game literally about nothing :) I\u00a0challenge you guys to that idea of nothing and make a game of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T07:44:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e3/5e3a411a89432f88e44e265b28e7712c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zalop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
