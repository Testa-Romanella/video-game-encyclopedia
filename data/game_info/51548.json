His dreams are the essence that connects our world to reality. All planes exist within his mind, cogs in a machine none can comprehend. Often, his dreams are pleasant, bringing light to everything he touches. But when his dreams are dark, the nightmares that plague his mind run wild through forgotten realms. Step into his dream and explore that which is the Void King's nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOutrealm is a top-down roguelike hack and slash title. It combines traditional hack and slash gameplay with modern-day roguelike mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach realm has a required kill count to activate the portal there, increasing in each successive level. However as time passes, monsters grow in strength and resilience. To survive, you'll have to constantly rack up kill count and loot to become stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraverse varied worlds, from rain-drenched highlands to mushroom-filled catacombs. Each realm comes with it's own unique enemies and mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are seven playable characters with their own playstyle and specialist moves which set them apart from the rest. The first character unlocked is the Blade Master, an all-rounder designed for old-school Zelda players to pick up and play. However, characters such as the Boreal Hunter and Smasher are designed for advanced players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are eighty different items to loot within the game. Items come in chests spread throughout the realms, sometimes in plain sight, sometimes hidden. Items have many different effects, from increasing your raw damage, to providing defense boons, giving crowd control effects or triggering an attack.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you play, you'll collect achievements which in turn unlock new items and characters. There are also Item and Monster logs which fill in as you loot more and defeat monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith seven different playable characters, six vibrant worlds, eighty items to loot and over twenty achievements, Outrealm has plenty for the roguelike enthusiast to sink their teeth into.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/238/23833bb90fd060b526fbf33abaddfb1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rainbow Street Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rainbow Street Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
