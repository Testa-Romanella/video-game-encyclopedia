WebAssembly, recompile to allow itch.io hosting\r\nv2.01\r\n- Adjusted spike hitboxes to be more smaller/more lenient\r\n- Slightly tweaked the positioning of the stars and spikes in challenge mode screen 3-6 to make it\r\n  more difficult\r\n- Fixed a bug where climbing adjacent to a spike tile would result in being unable to climb downward\r\n- Removed most instances of being able to stand on the very edge of a spike tile\r\n- Dash or jump inputs that close the pause menu no longer cause a dash or jump once the menu is closed\r\n- Wallclimb no longer initiates from a grounded state (you need to be falling or jumping),\r\n  so walking into a wall no longer puts you in wallclimb\r\n- Fixed minor timing alignment of stars in screen 3-6\r\nv2.00\r\n- Added challenge mode -- a complete set of new, much more difficult levels that will really put\r\n  your abilities to the test!\r\n  Challenge mode is unlocked after finishing the game (persists across sessions)\r\n- Added a title screen which also functions as the menu for selecting between normal and challenge\r\n  mode\r\n- Added a pause menu option to quit to the title screen\r\n- Added a pause menu option to retry the current screen (in case you get stuck somehow)\r\n- Added unique background particle effects to each world\r\n- Lightened the background a bit and made the player/crows darker for world 3, to make them easier to\r\n  see\r\n- When dashing out of the initial phase of a walljump, you can now control your dash direction by\r\n  holding the desired direction while pressing the dash button (by default you dash away\r\n  from the wall) -- this allows dashing back into (or over) the wall you were climbing on\r\n- Changed in-game text to prefer saying \"Press C\" instead of \"Press Z\" (both still work)\r\n- Fixed an input bug that caused jump and dash inputs to carry over across respawns and transitions\r\n- Made mushroom bounce distance consistent -- previously the exact distance depended on your\r\n  position as you triggered the mushroom\r\n- Fixed a rare bug where you could stand on the edge of a mushroom without bouncing\r\n- Tweaked some physics code slightly, mostly noticable for mushroom bounces\r\n- Tweaked moving platform code slightly\r\n- Water edges and waterfalls now push you upward or downward when climbing on them\r\n- Water no longer pushes you while in initial dash startup or dash end cooldown\r\n- Squared up some corner tiles in world 3 to fit better against the spikes\r\n- Very slightly tweaked the water tile visuals in screen 3-7\r\n- Fixed a slight visual layer opacity issue in screen 2-4\r\nv1.04\r\n- Reworked cutscene text to be more consistent and easier to read\r\n- Changed the cutscene screen tile layout slightly to accomodate the new text position\r\n- Minor first-time initialization performance improvements\r\n- Added a tile to screen 3-7 to make it slightly easier\r\n- Fixed a minor visual bug where waterfalls could become out of sync when backtracking\r\n- Added \"Press Z to Continue\" prompt for first cutscene if you don't press anything for a bit\r\nv1.03\r\n- Fixed a minor tile collision issue in screen 2-4 introduced in v1.02\r\n- Added jump input buffering -- jump inputs will now carry over into the next few frames, so you'll\r\n  still jump even if you pressed the button slightly too early (e.g. while you were still falling)\r\nv1.02\r\n- Changed the collision of the starfish to use circles instead of squares, so they are consistent\r\n  regardless of orientation\r\n- Changed the last part of screen 2-4 to make it more clear that you need to jump before dashing\r\nv1.01\r\n- Fixed a framerate-dependent input bug that would sometimes cause jump or dash inputs to be dropped\r\n  (patched forward from v0.04 compo build)\r\n- Decreased minimum jump height and made jumps end more quickly when releasing the jump button\r\n- Reworked the end credits screen and added a function to restart the game\r\n- Added version number to the end credits screen\r\n- Track total time taken (pauses during menus, screen transitions, and cutscenes, but not respawns)\r\n- Added time taken and total death count display at end screen\r\n- Added a pause menu, available by pressing Escape, P, or Gamepad Start\r\n- Added menu function to restart the game from the beginning\r\n- Added menu option to show game timer and death count in-game (for speedrunning)\r\n- Added menu option to skip cutscene text (for speedrunning)\r\n- (The above two options persist across game sessions)\r\n- Fixed a few missing tiles for a screen transition at the very end of the game\r\n- Made a minor change to the mushroom bounce code that could prevent some potential issue with\r\n  getting \"stuck\" repeatedly bouncing on a mushroom\r\nv1.00\r\n- Added brand new tileset for world 3\r\n- Made the spike dash jumps in screens 3-5 and 3-8 more lenient to time\r\n- Removed one of the starfish at the beginning of screen 3-8 to make it easier\r\n- Slowed down the starfish at the end of screen 3-8 slightly\r\n- Removed a spike tile in screen 3-6 to make it easier\r\n- Slowed down the middle two starfish in screen 3-6 very slightly\r\n- Tweaked initial timing of platform in screen 3-5 to make it easier to retry\r\nv0.21\r\n- Moving platforms and enemies now reset on death and room transition for timing consistency\r\n- Tweaked the initial position of the first starfish in screen 2-2\r\n- Added additional control bindings, the new set is listed below:\r\n- Movement: Arrow keys, WASD, Gamepad Left Stick, Gamepad DPad\r\n- Jump: Z, C, J, L, Space, Numpad 1, Numpad 3, Gamepad A, Gamepad Y\r\n- Dash: X, K, Numpad 2, Gamepad X, Gamepad B\r\n- Advance Text: [any jump key], [any dash key], Return, Gamepad Start\r\n- The new bindings give you the flexibility to use Arrow Keys for movement + ZXC for jump/dash,\r\n  OR use WASD for movement + JKL for jump/dash as you see fit, with Space as an alternate jump key\r\n  in either case\r\n- Updated the first tutorial message to give you the choice between Z or C for jump\r\n  (other control bindings aren't referenced, it would be way too lengthy to list them all)\r\n- Fixed a minor tilemap issue in screen 1-5\r\nv0.20\r\n- Added brand new tileset for world 2\r\n- Added background detailing for world 2\r\n- Added white outline to text in certain cutscenes to show better against the new tileset\r\n- You can now climb by walking directly into a wall (without jumping)\r\n- Increased speed of climbing downwards\r\n- Reaching the floor while climbing downwards now makes you let go instead of stopping you\r\n- Letting go of the bottom edge of a climbable surface happens a bit earlier, to avoid mid-air cling\r\n  look\r\nv0.12\r\n- Disabled dropping from climbing by pressing the opposite direction (you need to either jump or\r\n  drop with jump + down now)\r\n- Made screens 3-4 and 3-8 easier\r\nv0.11\r\n- Fixed obstacles in screen 2-8, which was completely broken\r\n- Made screens 2-3, 2-4, and 2-8 slightly easier to avoid ramping up difficulty too quickly\r\n- Made most of world 3 more difficult to increase challenge, especially the last screen\r\n- Climbing now \"snaps\" onto the top of platforms earlier, to avoid awkward mid-air cling look\r\nv0.10\r\n- Added 3 brand new screens to world 3\r\n- Completely reworked screen 3-5 (previously the last screen of world 3)\r\n- Tweaked world 1 and world 2 screens slightly\r\n- You can now drop from climbing without walljumping by holding down while pressing jump\r\n- Dashing into a wall while holding towards the wall now interrupts the dash to climb immediately\r\n- Dashing while climbing or letting go from climbing now always dashes away from the wall\r\n- Tweaked the camera focus region for several screens, so you can more easily see what's ahead\r\n- Camera now \"settles\" more quickly when reaching its focus point\r\n- Very slightly increased the grace window for jumping after running off of a platform\r\n- Starfish in world 2 now rotate according to their paths instead of all spinning the same direction\r\n  forever\r\n- Improved performance by disabling offscreen objects\r\n- Maked the initial positions of timed obstacles consistent\r\n- Added proper gamepad support (for xbox controllers, A = jump, X = dash)\r\n- Properly center player position during cutscenes\r\n- Fixed some minor graphical issues (cleaned up some sprites, added missing tiles for screen\r\n  transitions)\r\n- Water and moving platforms no longer move the player during respawn\r\nv0.04 (Compo Version)\r\n- Fixed a game-breaking collision bug introduced in v0.03 that caused world 3 to be unfinishable\r\n- Fixed a framerate-dependent input bug that would sometimes cause jump or dash inputs to be dropped\r\nv0.03\r\n- Fixed flipped water animation bug in screen 2-8\r\nv0.02\r\n- Fixed delayed audio initialization bug (esp. in Chrome browsers)\r\n- Added short Cocoa Moss intro scene\r\n- Added version number to the title screen\r\n- Fixed some misaligned and missing background graphics\r\n- Filled in some missing background tiles\r\n- Made one set of moving platforms slightly slower in area 1\r\n- Wait a bit before showing the first tutorial message\r\n- Slightly tweak cutscene timing\r\n- Improve tutorial text display a bit (now positioned in worldspace, etc.)\r\n- Improved camera panning during ending cutscene\r\n- Fixed a bug where you can climb invisible walls after certain cutscenes\r\n- Make sideways mushrooms very slightly easier to collide with\r\nv0.01\r\n- First release!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:25", "background_image":
