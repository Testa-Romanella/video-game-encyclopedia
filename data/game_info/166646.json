Having a deadline was a massive help for me to actually get something finished!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tIt's a short story about writing horoscopes and the technological singularity. It's also kind of a rhythm game.<br/>\r\n\tI did the coding, story, art and some of the music. Big thanks to Urban Fox for the exclusive track which you can hear at the beginning.<br/>\r\n\tIn the coming days I will add some of my thoughts and some technical information on my blog. This is the first release by sleepy agents which is the name of my game dev studio - which isn't much more than me and a laptop at the moment!\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t---\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t2 Endings<br/>\r\n\tInteractive Audio - the music will be different depending on your choices and the timing of your choices<br/>\r\n\tApprox. 20 minutes long / 2000 words\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\t---\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tI'd love to receive any feedback. Can you read the text OK? Does this work on Linux and Mac? I haven't been able to test on those operating systems!<br/>\r\n\tAlso would you say this is \"too experimental\" or \"not experimental enough\" for your tastes?\r\n</p><p>Twitter @sleepyagents</p><p>---</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>If anybody would rather play on android I have now uploaded an APK.<br/><br/>http://www.mediafire.com/download/910lqw45y94fn07/NewPisces-1.9-release.apk<br/><br/>Or to download through the play store please join the play test Google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sleepyplaytest<br/>And once joined you can download through the play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sleepyagents.newpisces<br/><br/>This APK is a beta, I have not optimised for mobile devices so I won't be putting this on the public play store. I'll consider this in the future, but for now I'm shifting focus to my other game which will have a full android release.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/204/204d5f5c7ec71dc2188dff3919a7653a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sleepy Agents"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
