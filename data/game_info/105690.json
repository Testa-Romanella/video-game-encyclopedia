Currently no support for Linux or OSX, but perhaps in the future! </p>\n<p>Hyper Spacetime was developed by Ben Leggett and funded by Northern Ireland Screen, The Arts council of Northern Ireland Lottery funding. <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c51/c51b706ee6eabbdc2b788643437c3557.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Leggett"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
