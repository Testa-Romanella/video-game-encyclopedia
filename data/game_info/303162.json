It was a Bitsy game based on the old Nintendo Gameboy game Super Mario land with the goal to \u201cto emulate the game-play as exactly as possible\u201d by doing it best to mimic side-scrolling/plat-former genre. While I like the side-scroller idea at first, I feared that this would limit the amount of direction of movement, so I decide to put most of the game under the sea, since it would make more sense to why a person can move in all direction other than flying or being in space.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/608/6089f6752b6ef5374c153332496045bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SuperOni"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
