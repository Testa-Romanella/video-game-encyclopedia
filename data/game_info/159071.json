Well before the end came, a sleeper-ship was launched, hastily built and aimed at a distant star. It was an ark, full of cryogenically frozen people and enough genetic material to give humans another chance on a new world, if they could find one. That was 300 years ago. Contact was lost just as the ship reached Beta Persei.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, climate change ravaged those remaining on Earth. Against every prediction, humanity survived - barely. After many generations Earth has become habitable in some areas but there aren\u2019t enough people to perform the work that will need to be done to re-establish infrastructure. Each generation is smaller than the last. Some technology from prior space programs has been salvaged, and a small crew was sent to bring the sleeper-ship home so that Earth could rebuild and survive.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The players take the role of this small rescue crew; a space crew with insufficient training and equipment. Even at more than 99% the speed of light, roughly 200 years will pass on Earth before their return home from their voyage. The Earth they find upon their arrival will be unlike the Earth they had left behind; everyone they knew will be long dead, the geopolitical map will be rearranged, the globe will have endured centuries of meteorological upheaval. The crew will may be received as heroes, but also as strangers. Personally, they will come home to nothing, for better or worse.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Redshift</em>\u00a0is a science fiction scenario that explores the implications of the time dilation resulting from interstellar travel at near light speeds, and incorporates techniques to simulate the microgravity environment, interstellar communication, and internal duality.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Redshift</em>\u00a0premiered at\u00a0Fastaval 2018, and was nominated for the \"The Special Award\" by the Fastaval judges.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Practical: 7 players, 4 - 5 hours, extensive material preparations required.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3bac4139c6e5296a95630b8147ae5de3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Act Apart"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
