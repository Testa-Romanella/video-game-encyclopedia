All you have is a lighter that you light your way. Walking through the corridors you see old and rusty toilet cubicles, rusty showers, old sinks, vile insects run across the floor. You clearly do not want to stay here for a long time, so you are looking for a way out of this nasty place. Along the way, you will meet both characters who will help you, and those who will simply kill you.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This is a demo and not the final product, a lot can change on the release.
