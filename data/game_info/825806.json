It is a drag-and-drop game in which you have to place the flags of different nations next to each other. But watch out, when the time runs out, the game is over!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Game objective:<br/>Fill the entire playing field with flags while collecting as many points as possible. You get two points for each matching colour. Be quick: The faster you are, the better you can achieve time combos that increase your points.\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>In the right field you have six flags, from which you can choose, which one you want to drag and drop into the left field. There you can place it next to any flag (preferably one that has the same colour on the connecting side, to get points).\r\n\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>The following colours are available: black, white, yellow, orange, red, dark red, green, light green, blue, light blue.<br/></p>\n<p>Unfortunately we only had time for 106 (out of 196) flags. We are sorry for every flag we did not have time to draw!\r\n\r\n</p>\n<p>And now: Enjoy the game!\u00a0</p>\n<p>---------------\r\n</p>\n<p>We used the following applications:\r\n</p>\n<p>Game development: Unity Engine\r\n</p>\n<p>Graphics: Paint 3D\r\n</p>\n<p>Sound &amp; Music: Bosca Ceoil<br/></p>\n<p>The background is from\u00a0Pixabay (Image ID: 1074131)\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T08:07:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab5/ab5c39ea951fd1d6cee56ea9b1c15148.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lapotator"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
