Raster revolves around the song <strong>Randomly, A Train Appears</strong> by <strong>A-D-D-F_Toxic</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong>Valkoy and I were dreaming about making a top down RPG where bosses time their attack to the beats of the song, but we knew we couldn't make it in time. Coincidentally, we ended up watching some \"Just Shapes and Beats\" gameplay and decided to make something similar for the Jam.</p>\n<p>For that little bit of spice, we sprinkled in an object that acts similar to an \"Enter the Gungeon\" blank that could clear all bullets on the screen, if you reach it quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>\n<p>Songs:</p>\n<ul><li>A-D-D-F_Toxic - Randomly, A Train Appears: Main Level</li><li>Corell - Melting Ice Cubes: Menu</li><li>Steve Wilder Blumenthal - quiet blur: Ending Theme</li></ul>\n<p>As well as a host of sound effects made using\u00a0bfxr + sounds from Open Game Art. The font used is Silver, one of my favorite.</p>\n<p>Developer: Thuleanx</p>\n<p>Artist: Valkoy</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to<strong> A-D-D-F_Toxic </strong>for the song as well as helping me get the tempo right.

Interact with the song list will allow you to load the game's levels (in this case there's only 1 map).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T08:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/51e/51e52efeeaa00810421c60a826469748.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Valkoy", "Thuleanx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
