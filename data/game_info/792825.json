This is a single-player 5th Edition adventure that can be played without a dungeon master. To play this game, you will just need a 2nd level character, some dice (or a digital dice-roller), and a very basic understanding of the 5th Edition rules. Due to technological limitations, this story uses a slightly simplified version of the game, so some options that are typically available to you as a player may not be here. Regardless, I hope you will enjoy this adventure!\r\n</p>\n<p>This story is a retelling of the quest of the same name from RuneScape, an MMO by Jagex. Special thanks to Jagex for the inspiration. A special thanks also goes to Seth Jones, whose guide I used to create this adventure.
