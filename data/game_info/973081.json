It starts as a relaxing, colourful VR romp that's casual then demands higher levels of skill from the player, eventually evolving into a brick-breaker that is as challenging as it is fun.  Walls slide closer to the player, multiple balls appear, explosive balls help destroy the bricks while bonuses in the form of extra lives, larger and dual paddles fly at the player. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe levels are visceral and the environments provide ample food for the senses.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-08T06:52:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55fb0c786f3012fe64d1f9522c2aa866.jpg", "website": "https://www.mydigitalgarden.au", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["My Digital Garden"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DP Image Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
