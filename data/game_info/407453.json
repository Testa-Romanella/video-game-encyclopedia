He has transformed three parts of the world into a military war zone. Rumor has it that he has captured a Gun boat and he is heading towards the UK ports in order to cause even more havoc.</p>\n<p>Armed in a heavy armored tank. Your mission is to battle through three different battle zones, which is heavily guarded by the agent's army. The enemies are based on ground, air and on water. Some enemies will aim for your tank's position . Others will just fire the direction they are facing. Luckily help will be at hand. There are power ups which can be collected in order to allow you to fire your bullets more rapidly.<br/></p>\n<p>At the end of each stage is a large boss. Fight the boss in order to complete the stage more quickly. You will then move on to the bonus stage, where you are placed at a firing range. Simply blast at those targets and rake in as many points as possible before moving on to the next stage. <br/></p>\n<p>Can you reach all the way to England and sink the Gun Boat with the agent inside, or will chaos reign across the world? Good luck.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<p>Game design, graphics and sound effects:<br/><strong>Alf Yngve </strong>and <strong>Richard Bayliss<br/></strong>(Created using the Shoot Em Up Construction Kit by Sensible Software)</p>\n<p>SEUCK Redux and Tape loader source by<br/><strong>Martin Piper</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Additional programming and char set:<br/><strong>Richard Bayliss</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Loading picture artwork by:<br/><strong>Arcadestation<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>(C) 2020 The New Dimension for Reset issue 13</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>*** COMING SOON ***</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T03:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d89/d896bfa0d906cd97b008105743ad12e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
