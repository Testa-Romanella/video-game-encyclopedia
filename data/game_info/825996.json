May it be by collecting coins (10 points for each) or activating paints (3 points for a orange one, 1 point for a pink one).</p>\n<p>Your enemy is your past self \u2013 every time you pick a coin, a memory of your movement appears. You have to avoid those memories\u00a0to stay alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Orange and pink paint drops result with a temporary effect. Orange paint makes coins disappear, so you cannot pick them. The pink one makes your past selves disappear, making you invulnerable.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>arrows \u2013 change player's movement direction</li><li>enter \u2013 pause and\u00a0open menu</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T09:25:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa0b23981010f2c7b47d883d93f726e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beetroot Paul"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
