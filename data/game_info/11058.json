During combat, players give high-level commands to a small fleet, positioning their ships, ramming and boarding others. Ships and terrain are fully destructible: they can catch fire, explode, break apart, and fall. Players can also compete against one another in Internet and LAN matches.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe ships are highly detailed, teeming with sailors moving around at their individual tasks, like an ant farm or a cut-away drawing. The player's choices in ship layout are crucial, and an important part of the game is exploring the design space of different airships and their matching tactics.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-02T13:09:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd1ef2a47e6a17011eb6d80e79484c84.jpg", "website": "http://www.zarkonnen.com/airships/", "rating": 3.57, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 75, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 8, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 14, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Zarkonnen", "David Stark"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Fighting", "Indie"], "publishers": ["David Stark"], "esrb_rating": null}
