In the main campaign mode you must complete quests from different characters to earn money and unlock new equipment and upgrades. You must explore and make money to unlock new parts of the cave and find rare and expensive minerals. In order to thrive you must watch your back for different species of slimes who call the cave their home, they don't take kindly to visitors.<h3>Early Access Features</h3>Although the game is in Early Access the base of the game is still there and a lot of content to go with it. We already have things like Quests, Multiple Unique Areas, lots of Resources to collect, Enemies, and some Machinery to unlock. You already have a very large abundance of Pickaxes and Equipment to choose from and unlock. Over time I will release new content until I feel that the game is ready for a full release. This does not mean the content will stop though, I will try to continue to update the game over time adding more content and polishing it if the community supports it.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T02:34:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/901/9017b5846d9e9302da5a63b032498908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LethalLizardStudios"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LethalLizardStudios"], "esrb_rating": null}
