I put a lot of work into this game and I didn't plan on releasing it to the public. This game was made for my small friend group who used to make dump YouTube videos in high school.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game aims to capture the video series we made about our friend, Mark, who is the fastest sprinter in the world. Gameplay is similar to Mike Tyson's Punch Out in the respect of trying to beat x number of racers in order to become the champion before you lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like Mike Tyson's Punch Out, each level has a different gimmick. Usually having different obstacles or the controls may change on certain levels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have made several YouTube videos on how to beat each level for anyone who gets stuck on a live. Some levels are easy, some are hard. Most are skill based, some require problem solving. SPOILERS,\u00a0here is the full playlist of videos:\u00a0https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsQCzLpVS_BK4Mgtainv_ZfvgfSAwZ7Bh</p>\n<p>The main objective is becoming champion. There is a side quest of collecting keys, so feel free to do that as well. There are characters you can unlock as well as decorations to decorate your house.</p>\n<p>Please message me if you have any questions of requests. I do have physical copies available that comes with a box, \u00a0manual, and cartridge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was also the first game I have ever made. Graphics and music\u00a0are not my strength. I am thankful for the following creators on itch and resources that let me use their asset packs for free: GBStudio, hUGETracker, sonDanielson, GibbonGL, Gavin, MonkeyImage, MaterialFuture, Parabellum Games, and Rekkimaru. Thank you again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T08:33:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe0/fe009ff1c8b616647cd839e2a3c69855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GrandpasGameBox"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
