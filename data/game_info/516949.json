If you fail you get to watch SN8 blow up to small pieces.</p>\n<p>The game offers 5 different landing pads of increasing difficulty. The player can freely choose between these pads. A scoring system &amp; statistics are offered after each flight.</p>\n<p>Starship SN8 is fully controllable. Each of the 4 control surfaces is individually controlled. The landing legs can be deployed by the player and the throttle /\u00a0roll /\u00a0pitch / yaw controls that are familiar from games such as KSP are all included.</p>\n<p>There are two game modes included:</p>\n<ul><li>Normal:\u00a0<ul><li>The default mode, control surfaces only offer some lift and even with the engines turned off the player can control SN8 with normal roll/pitch/yaw controls.</li></ul></li><li>Hard:<ul><li>Special super hard mode. When the engines turn off the player loses all roll/pitch/yaw control and has to rely on the control surfaces / flaps to control SN8.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Fly and land Starship SN8! Get a highscore! Or crash and burn! The choice is yours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:50:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae6/ae672b0f8fe5031b5b387e90417dd2a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["olliarkko"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
