This means online matches, the culling store, and all online features will no longer be available.                                                             </p>\n<p>Welcome to The Culling. As a contestant on this deadly game show you must explore, scavenge items, craft weapons, and build traps that will enable you to slay your fellow contestants and emerge victorious before the end of the round. Only with cunning, skill, and a little luck will you be able to prevail and survive the match.<br />\nUnlike add-on modes in open-world survival games, The Culling redefines the Battle Royale genre by providing a tightly focused stand-alone experience that delivers incredible thrills and endless story-worthy moments.<br />\nFeatures at Early Access LaunchGame ModesThe core of The Culling is an online 16-player battle royale, played solo or in teams of two. Matches last approximately 20 minutes, with deadly poison gas slowly constricting the arena in the final stages. The winning player (or team) is the last left alive.<br />\nThe new, fast-paced Lightning Round mode pits 8 contestants against each other in a smaller arena with a 10-minute  timer, where everyone has immediate access to some of the most powerful weapons in the game.<br />\nWith no respawning on death, you have to make every action count. Play too cautiously and you won\u2019t be prepared for the final clash at the end of the match, too aggressively and you might not make it past the first few minutes. We leave the balance, and the killing, up to you.Weapons and CombatThe Culling focuses heavily on melee combat. Use jabs, charged swings, blocks, and shoves in a system that\u2019s simple learn, but requires practice to truly master.<br />\nThere are 32 melee weapons in the form of blades, axes, bludgeons, and spear. Weapons are divided into tiers based on damage, from the lowly crafted stone knife to the mighty Sledgehammer. Different weapons types also apply different wounds, which factor into combat strategy. All melee weapons can be thrown, adding the potential for ranged combat in any encounter.<br />\nThere are a variety of ranged weapons, including bows, blowguns, and even firearms. A gun isn\u2019t a guaranteed kill, however, as ammunition is in short supply and ranged players can be disarmed by melee strikes if they don\u2019t keep their distance.TrapsPlayers who thrive on outwitting their enemies can sample from a collection of traps in the form of snares, mines, remote-detonated explosives, caltrops, and punji sticks. Matches are fast-paced, so sneaky players must lay their traps in hot spots (such as near an airdrop landing pad) or use themselves as bait to lure opponents in.ItemsA wide range of utility items are at your disposal, with everything from backpacks to smoke bombs, run speed stims to stun guns, player tracking devices to bandages. You start each match empty-handed, so you must explore to survive. Inventory space is extremely limited, forcing you to think carefully about how you intend to play and what you want to carry.CraftingThe Culling utilizes a unique crafting system that is very simple to use (no bulky UI-heavy inventory management) but still offers a wide range of recipes. Players can craft rudimentary weapons, a wide range of traps, and a handful of useful items, including bandages, satchels, and even body armor.PerksEach contestant chooses 3 perks before the start of a match. There are dozens of perks available, and they range from combat bonuses (increase the backstab potential of your blades) to crafting skills (reduce your trap placement time), to general utility (begin the match with a tracking device in your inventory).<br />\nAll of the perks are available to all players from the start with no unlocking required. You can use perks to define and enhance your personal play style, whether it be focused on ranged, melee, or trap-based strategy. Advanced players will find helpful synergies between their perk load-out and their airdrop selection.AirdropsPlayers select a personal airdrop to call in during the match. Air drops are deadly care packages containing a predefined variety of weapons, traps and items. Be careful, because calling in an airdrop draws attention to you and can be stolen by other players.Game Show EventsThe Culling is the most popular game show in the history of the world, and for good reason. The show\u2019s producers have devised events that take place at random during the match. If you choose to participate in these events, the rewards can improve your chances of winning, but don\u2019t be surprised when other players arrive to challenge you.FUNCFlexible Universal Nano-Compound, or FUNC, serves as the primary in-game currency. You spend FUNC to craft, call in personal airdrops, and open certain types of item chests. FUNC is gained through combat and exploration.Character CustomizationPlayers can customize every aspect of their appearance: Hair, Clothing, Skin Tone, and Gender. There are hundreds of unlockable items.<br />\nThe Culling also features customizable Taunts, Victory Celebrations, Culling Cards, and Weapon Skins.<br />\nIn all, there are more than 1,500 cosmetics to unlock.AudioThe Culling places a heavy gameplay emphasis on audio. Making noise by sprinting through the jungle crafting items, slamming doors, and engaging in combat will draw the attention of nearby contestants.<br />\nUsing audio cues to locate opponents and using the crouch mode to conceal your movements add tremendously to the game\u2019s suspense and immersion.MapsThe Culling features two maps: The Island, set in a tropical paradise, and Cul County Correctional, a former prison facility converted to game show duty. The maps have been carefully tuned to provide just enough space for 16 contestants, but also to ensure than no one is safe for long. They are populated with landmarks, buildings (full of lockers and crates containing items), hidden caches, and hazards.<br />\nMany of these elements are random, meaning map knowledge is important, but offers no guarantees. When the match starts, you can choose to immediately set about crafting some basic survival tools, or sprint to the nearest building in the hopes that it will contain valuable items.Tutorials and Offline Training ModeThe Culling can be intimidating for new players, so we\u2019ve included a basic tutorial and a training range to help you get your feet wet.<br />\nIf you\u2019re still not ready to face players online, there is an offline practice mode against basic AI-controlled bots that will allow you to practice in a low-pressure situation.Player XP and LevelingAs you compete online in The Culling, you earn XP, which levels up your character and awards you Cull Crates full of new cosmetics. The better your performance, the faster you progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T00:16:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559e4c7b865d533ad3079d50f770d013.jpg", "website": "http://www.theculling.com", "rating": 2.48, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 705, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 66, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 40, "ratings_count": 101, "suggestions_count": 469, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 101, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Xaviant"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xaviant Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
