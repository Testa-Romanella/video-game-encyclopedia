Welcome to the Neta-Vark where the Wamnis live and celebrate the beauty of the universe. And not even the invasion of the dangerous Trogoglux will stop the party. The Doldazan Gods will save the Wamnis so that nothing will stop the celebrations. Nothing? Or is there something which could actually ruin everything?</p>\n<p>What about <strong>vridniX</strong>? A hero that can't stop running! He bounces against walls, hangs on to the ceiling with his massive tongue, can do backflips in mid-air and above all... he has the unique ability to rotate the levels by picking up special orbs! The problem: He is a selfish brat. And our main character. <strong>vridniX</strong>, is a lazy kid who wants others to worship him. It's when the Trogoglux come to the Neta-Vark that <strong>vridniX </strong>will stand up to be the first one to stop them. But on his way, by using his ability to rotate the zones, he will eventually destroy all the places he passes through.</p>\n<p><em><strong>vridniX </strong>mixes frantic platformer gameplay and an original story that will continually surprise you!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><em>\n<ul><li>Never stop running!\r\n</li><li>Make the levels rotate\r\n</li><li>Survive in 6 strange worlds and over 100 frantic levels\r\n</li><li>Meet many twisted characters in funny cutscenes\r\n</li><li>Fight epic bosses, but you can't attack!\r\n</li><li>7+ hours of gameplay!\r\n</li><li>Destroy everything you love\r\n</li><li>Face the salt</li></ul></em>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d62/d62e1c632da348b4f1bf31ba4ccf25b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Uncanaut"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
