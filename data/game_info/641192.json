The switch mechanic allows you to toggle between square and circle mode. Square has time altering capabilities whereas circles can fit in smaller areas. I\u00a0learned a lot from making this game for GeoJam. I reused very few assets from previous projects, and the ones I\u00a0did reuse I\u00a0modified heavily such as my player controller and scene transition code. Be sure to leave some constructive criticism on how I\u00a0can improve the game in future updates, and thank you for playing. I\u00a0joined the jam late and ended up making this in essentially 24-48 hours and I am proud of the result.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T07:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2cf6635199be828d3dcc0429943488f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["J053PH"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
