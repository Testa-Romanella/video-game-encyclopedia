Made for the 2022 Cozy Fall jam.</p>\n<p>An update with SFX will be coming soon, because I didn't have enough time to add them during the jam. Also, in the first downloadable, you can't finish the game, so just download v.1.2.</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS: The pause menus' a bit broken and I mean in the sense that It will literally destroy the entire game if you use it. So try not to too much :D. Also, the checkbox for the speedrun timer doesn't work, (there is a timer no matter what).\u00a0 Maybe I'll fix it later though\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T05:34:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fc/5fc0863c72ad1e69bb7d63ccd58353ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CodeMassi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
