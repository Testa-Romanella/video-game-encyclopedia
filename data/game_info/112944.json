You either will go through this game to the end, while in berserker mode, or you will go to the surgeon to sew on your torn fingers. And then back to Dungeon Pain again!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Whether Geometry games are the ordinary runners? Forget it! Dungeon Pain will be your personal hangman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0All your life's difficulties and problems are children's babble compared to the feelings, which you will have when playing this game.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It is impossible to overcome this dungeon in one way, that\u2019s why you will feel a crazy delight again with each new passage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Before starting the game, it's best to immediately register for an appointment with a psychiatrist. And before taking a psychiatrist, advise him to also make an appointment with a psychiatrist!</p>\n<p>\u00a0Are you ready to learn the limits of your capabilities?</p>\n<p>\u00a0Then remove the animals from the screen and forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Swing faster, while Dungeon Pain isn\u2019t aligned to the mass destruction means, because it is much more powerful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  This is a crazy adventure of geometric shapes, perhaps in one of the most complex and impossible games. Have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f15/f15a1e178e4015d9a0abb0776aaf9392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BigStakeGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
