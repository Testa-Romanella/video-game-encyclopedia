A quick-ish, multi-ending Twine game looking at what it's like to talk a big game but never deliver. An exploration of trying to cover up one's mistakes rather than trying to fix or learn from them. Perhaps something of a digital diss track, but whatever. It's (mostly) in good fun.</p><p>(Threw it up as a download instead of play-in-browser because some of the passages are pretty hefty, and scrolling didn't seem to work.
