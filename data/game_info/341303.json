{"id": 341303, "slug": "tiltanium", "name": "Tiltanium", "name_original": "Tiltanium", "description": "<p> Tiltanium is a mobile, skill based, action packed, race against the clock. The goal is to collect all of the objects in a level (currently just the gears) before time runs out, while avoiding obstacles that will reduce your time. It uses tilting mechanics to move the ball around and does have simple puzzles, but currently the real key is speed and control. Touch mechanics are also used but not highly broadcasted in the gameplay.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support the development of Tiltanium\u00a0 please let me know via email at TiltaniumDev@gmail.com, on the game's page, or by donating when you download Tiltanium!\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you play Tiltanium please fill out the playtest survey here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/uoFkEgPvjojWeZjE9</p>\n<p>Gameplay Vid:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qra5zhNekSL6S-QiZm5PmcK4UeOjDHHm/view?usp=shari...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ada/ada526ff09872bc15815455c848d4e83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Angel5"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
