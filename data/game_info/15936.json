You must understand what is happening, who is behind it all and how to stop it, if it can be stopped. To search for evidence you need to be as careful as possible, but not concentrating on just one thing. This can play a trick on you!<br/>And yes - you are the only one who was sent to this city. The government believes that some large sect has been located in the city, so residents are not allowed to get in touch. Officially, your task is a diplomatic visit. If you fail, the question will be raised about military intervention, which threatens a transition to a full-scale war and, as it turns out, people around the world will be killed by what people are not able to realize.<h3>Features:</h3><ul><li><strong>Pretty unusual horror game to play.</strong><br/></li><li><strong>Say \" NO !\" to darkness in horror projects!</strong><br/></li><li><strong>No scrimmers!
