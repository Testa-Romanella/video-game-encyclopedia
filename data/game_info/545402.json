The 48 hours were spread around my\u00a0Christmas holidays. The jam was done by four Godot devs (including me) and will be documented in a YouTube video \ud83d\ude01</p>\n<p>We all used the same art asset:</p>\n<p>https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Yes, all the things in this game are from this pack (Except music and fonts). I\u00a0created some shaders using some generated noise.</p>\n<p>Music is all CC-BY or CC-0 licensed music, so THANKS a lot to the cool bands!</p>\n<p>The game has some bugs or at least annoying things - it's a gamejam game and the time limit put up some limitations. <strong>But I\u00a0am thinking about making the game a bit bigger and releasing a \"full\" version. Let me know what you think about that in the comments!</strong></p>\n\r\nWhy I REALLY made this game?\r\n<p>First, as an escape. An escape from the daily covid insanity, a little escape from my main hobby project Bottomless. A little room to feel free - To let out the feelings that are deep inside me - <strong><em>The love for METAL, V8 ENGINES, SMELL OF GASOLINE, EXPLOSIONS, DUMB DIALOGUES, MAD MAX, POST-APOCALYPSE, A LITTLE INSANITY and GUNS.</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T04:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae9/ae928a43a285aa0972eee9bf4f1642f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Raffaele Picca"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
