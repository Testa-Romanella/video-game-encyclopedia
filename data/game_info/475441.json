Have an accurate New York Millennials Blaseball experience in the comfort of your own home! Please note that this is a fan-made game and is not affiliated with the commissioner, who's doing a great job! Not sure what Blaseball is? Check it out here: https://blaseball.com<br/></p>\n<p>This is a short Choose Your Own Adventure game. It's similar to the CYOA books you might be familiar with except instead of turning to a page all of the choices are links you can click on.</p>\n<p>Generally if you see a link at the bottom of the passage it's a choice you can make. There are also links that are embedded in the story passage text itself. Clicking these provides you with further information or context.</p>\n<p>This game was made using the Twine engine and the Chapbook story format. See https://twinery.org/ for more details.</p>\n<p>This is the first time I've made a Twine game or uploaded anything to Itch before so if there are any bugs or you have any other difficulties please let me know!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:54:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e19/e19e7331a8a5d0972da5878f70606a19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sarksus"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
