This my second try of ludum dare, I think my performance is better than last time:)</p><p>The theme is \"two button controls\" and \"growing\", and I decided to use both at begining, and then I thought about what to make for a long time\u2026\u2026The final answer is the classic \"snake\".</p><p>But my snake is not a normal one. It grows without eating!
