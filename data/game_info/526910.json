You control a Purple rectangular prism and your goal is to get from the green platform to the red platform. You may turn your camera 90\u00b0 at any time, which may change your perception of the level.</p>\n<p>Ortho is the first game I've ever developed and although it's a small project I'm quite proud of it. I hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I did creating it!</p>\n<p>*Ortho is currently only available for Windows*</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:57:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/323/323e77a2f30c1c6483cbef42c0935d3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jargonloster"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
