Despite the small scope of the game, it was fun to work on this project and I hope you enjoy playing it too.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:00:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0d/a0dff29641bc6fb56ee17c5c4082f54c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZubatSoup"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
