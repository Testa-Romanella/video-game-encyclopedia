Avoid the red primitives and steep declines as you help Ball navigate the giant structure for an end that is unknown. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tInspired by the classics of the 80's and 90s, Forgotten Ball is not just your ordinary 2D platformer. At the corner of a play area, the game rotates by 90 degrees to allow movement on either the X or Z axis. \r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tForgotten Ball is an enjoyable but challenging experience, some areas are easy\u2026some not so. Just make sure you don't go the wrong way. You can also unlock over 24 ball surfaces in the game and 2 additional hidden abilities. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8d/a8d0a73a4c06901b32817c9efb3df005.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["littleGigantic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
