Players must build and manage their \n      growing empires in turn-based strategy, and then engage in all out \n      starship combat in real-time action.\n    </p><p>\n      Strategically, players must effectively manage their limited resources \n      to expand their empire. Players can decide how to best achieve \n      objectives\u00a0by managing fleets, admirals,\u00a0building support structures, \n      researching technology\u00a0and engaging enemies in\u00a0combat.
