You have been accused of a terrible crime. The law has said you are guilty, a pardon isn\u2019t going tohappen, and on the eve of your execution you begin to wonder how you got to this point in your life. This is your final moment on earth.</p>\n<p>During the game you will traverse your Memories, reconstruct your life, and find deep regret or peaceful solace. Each player represents a different Memory that led to your execution. You may find that you are entirely innocent; or you may find that you are as guilty as they all say. Either way, you\u2019re here and it was your choices that landed you on death row.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T07:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/2784fa956f20b1ded8b3baf4550f1ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the_closetgamer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
