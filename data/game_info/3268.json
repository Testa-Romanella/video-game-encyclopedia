{"id": 3268, "slug": "the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter", "name": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter", "name_original": "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter", "description": "<p>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a horror adventure game, heavily focused on the narrative. You are Paul Prospero, a detective with paranormal abilities. You get a letter from a boy named Ethan Carter, who cries out for help. You have nothing to do but go to his town and find out what happens to Ethan\u2019s family.<br />\nThe game is focused on puzzle solving and exploration, and set in an open world environment. The superpowers you obtain make your investigation easier: you can sense where hidden objects are and restore the circumstances of the crimes you reveal.<br />\nAs a rule, the game shows you the path (literally and figuratively), but any derogations add details to the atmosphere of the game. So you can freely explore locations, read numerous notes and learn more about the inhabitants of the town you came to. On the other hand, you can follow the main line directly, and it won&#39;t be spoiled by the lack of details. In the end, the game becomes something between an interactive drama and a detective quest.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2014-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-03T08:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/90c/90caf1fcb836cad70013452f6f239008.jpg", "website": "http://EthanCarterGame.com", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 299, "owned": 2487, "beaten": 580, "toplay": 176, "dropped": 154, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 667, "suggestions_count": 548, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 671, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["The Astronauts"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["THQ Nordic", "The Astronauts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
