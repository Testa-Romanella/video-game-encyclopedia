The game takes place in a <strong>dark dungeon</strong> where the we have to guide the rat to the exit by finding the path and placing cheese in such a way to <strong>guide the rat</strong> in the right direction. To avoid going out of bounds, place the lights to figure out the path in the dark and place the right amount of <strong>cheese along the way</strong> in order the rat will follow. Let's see if you can clear all <strong>6 levels we have included</strong> and let us know your feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T07:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c87d716a29f03a7a904bb6d77ea313.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["berry410"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
