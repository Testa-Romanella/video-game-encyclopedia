Using strategy and a bit of luck, you can stack and move the cars along the roundabout to their designated exit.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent of games such as number stacking and block push puzzle. Beat the score of 180, and then 360, and then if you are good enough, go for the highest score well beyond that. There is no limit to what you can get for your high score. Get on the leader board to show what you are made of.</p>\n<p>With nostalgic design as the background, and a soothing music to accompany the experience, enjoy a fun-filled and challenging game that hopefully will rattle the brain and unwind at the same time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T05:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf4/bf4876881384d62230316661cbc74e6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pl41d"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
