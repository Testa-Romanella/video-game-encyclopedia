You are the cheapest and fastest way to get a rough idea of where water might be on that barren but probably totally fine unexplored planet down there. Take this stick and hold it like so, and when it points toward the ground, shove one of these stakes where it's pointing and we'll drop a well as close as we can. If the well detects something, it'll signal us, and we'll throw down some habitat pods. Apologies in advance for any bad trajectories. We're all doing our best up here. Anyway, you'll probably need to move the pods to get them close to the wells. They'll take care of the rest, but they can be a bit of trouble to move, so we're giving you some boots, too. These are real nice, latest steel-toe tech, really fashionable and very chic boots. They also have excellent stomp ability, and just first rate kick action. Go ahead, give 'em a little walkabout. So anyway, that's it. If you'll just, uh, get in, and, yeah, you may need to, uh,\u00a0oh, you got it. You good? Cool.

I haven't tried serialization in earnest before, and struggled through the final hours\u00a0to get it working on a looping planet. But I think it works. I'm pretty sure it works. Please let me know if you try booting up the game a second time and see your past works spread before you.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T21:25:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f4/5f41f8289b8b3f15ec68940630e47796.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jamblefoot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
