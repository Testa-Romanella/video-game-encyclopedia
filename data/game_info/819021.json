The result of the dice roll determines the damage.\u00a0At the start of the game you're given a choice between different dice, which can be three different types:</p>\n<p>D4: four sides | D6: six sides | D10: ten sides</p>\n<p>You will see the sides of the dice when you choose, these sides can come up equally likely.\u00a0 The higher the sides of the dice, the slower they are, and the slower your reload. D10 gives you the chance for great damage, but it's slow to use.</p>\n<p>The game also randomizes each level and multiple game mechanics on that level</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p><p>Created by: Bluegru, Daemon</p><p>Art by: Pebll</p><p>Music by:\u00a0\u00a0Retcon187</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T14:47:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c3/7c377cf94cd1e52b22bd2ec1a0ef2392.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Daemon", "Bluegru", "pebll", "Retcon187"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
