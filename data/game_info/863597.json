How do they open? Why do the blinds work like that? What does it mean to \"kippen\"?\u00a0</p><p>I thought it would be fun pay tribute to my home for the past several years and use the Playdate's crank to simulate pulling on the pulley thing. <br/></p><p>Step one of this was intended to just be when you opened the blinds a different scene was displayed, and then step two would involve a light game in trying to balance on a thermometer the room temperature by openings/closing/tilting the window and lowering the blinds. But this month was just too crazy to have the time for all of that. Hopefully one day! <br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T22:25:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ca/3ca2b5334a31f2f133258d1a1d9a3335.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tannerbaum"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
