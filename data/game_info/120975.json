Ours was to create an impressive amount of content for a jam game (duh, 2 game designers).</p>\n<p>We are satisfied with our results, and hope you will share our feelings too :3</p>\n<p>At least you can check the amount of level design we did:</p>\n\n<p>To be honest there is much more hidden rooms and secrets, than normal level design xD</p>\n<p>So, for Metroidvania we made it clear xD</p>\n<p>As for Bubble shooter we used a few concepts:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Shoot clusters with appropriate color to remove them.</strong></li><li><strong>Shoot monsters with appropriate color to damage them. Other colors will not deal damage!</strong></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Also we should mention that some monsters have invulnerable zones.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shoot with blue bubbles at walls to create additional platforms.</strong></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>A,D</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Movement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>Space</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Jump</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Aim with mouse</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Mouse Button</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Shoot</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mouse wheel</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>Q/E</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0<strong>Switch to next bubble color (if you have those colors)<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>J - Re-play the effect after all stars collected :3</strong></p>\r\nPostLD Changelog:\r\n<p>I think this is important to say what the difference between our LD41 and PostLD versions. <br/></p>\n<p>Here you can check the  LD41 version.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>1. Added enemy hitting animation<br/>2. Finally finished parallax effect :3<br/>3. Minor fixes of level design in two rooms<br/>4. Added a rewarding effect for those who collected all the stars :3<br/>5. Fixed minor visual bugs (a few objects was on the wrong layers)<br/>6.</strong><strong> Added tutorial boards<br/>7.
