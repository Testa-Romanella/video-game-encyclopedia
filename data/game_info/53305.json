Both were released in the fall of 2001 in Japan, neither have been officially translated into other languages. However, an English fan translation of the video game was completed in 2013.<br />\nUnlike other areas of the Suikoden franchise, in which the storyline is a major element of gameplay, Card Stories focuses mainly on the card battles themselves and less on the plot.<br />\nMost of the cards feature characters who appear in both Suikoden and Suikoden II of Konami&#39;s role-playing video game series. Several cards also feature characters who would later go on to appear in Suikoden III.<br />\nThe GBA game retells the story of Suikoden II with a few changes to how they transpire.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-16T09:33:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/83d/83df7b31c6049e7d36019ce5d40580c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 270, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Will"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Konami"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
