The idea was to create a remake from scratch in a short amount of time. We decided to participate with a remake of the MSX game\u00a0Road Fighter: a simple racing game that would be doable before the deadline and still be fun to play (oh the nostalgia!).</p>\n<p>In the end we met the deadline (barely!) and sent in our entry. When finally the results came in, we finished 7th out the 83 entries. Not too bad for a 2 month project :)</p>\n<p>Source code available at Bitbucket -\u00a0Road Fighter</p><p>Original source code by Brain Game -\u00a0Road Fighter</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1da559267828c1839085eb8e6909c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Wild Spike"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
