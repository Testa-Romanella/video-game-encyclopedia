(To make the maze more navigable, you can also reverse the snub operation and break the octahedron's symmetry; these aren't strictly necessary.)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T05:45:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47e/47ea8b222b7149ba7ef40c2528ff3710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hyperpixel"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
