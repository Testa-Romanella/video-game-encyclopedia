The deposits are<br/>deep beneath the surface, trapped within caves that descend in to the<br/>alien planets core. You must navigate your shuttle pod using the \u2018z\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019<br/>keys, this will activate the pods side thrusters and move you from side to<br/>side, but once on the move the shuttle will continue to move in that direction!<br/>You must avoid hitting the cave walls, while trying to navigate on to the \u2018O\u2019<br/>deposits. This is harder than it seems however, as the magnetic properties<br/>of the walls are playing havoc with the shuttles thrusters! Trying to navigate<br/>on to the vital \u2018O\u2019 deposits is\u00a0extremely difficult as you must be<br/>precise in order to get the vital energy.<br/>If you successfully manage to grab the \u2018O\u2019 you will hear a confirmation beep, but you<br/>must stay alert! Successfully grabbing some \u2018O\u2019 will increase your score by 50 points!<br/>So it is well worth pursuing. Hitting the walls will result in instant death! And the game will start again. Be warned though.. the cave walls get narrower every 100 points and the amount of \u2018O\u2019 depletes the deeper you go. Try to stay alive for as long as possible and collect as much \u2018O\u2019 energy as you can on your way down! Carry on commander!<br/>And good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-15T07:18:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d2a3a177b6f276c9f1e3d04a796092a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Loudscotsbloke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
