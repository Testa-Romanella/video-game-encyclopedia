The world of the 9-5 office job is a soul-sucking hell, and that hell is only exacerbated when the boss man refuses to pay you your worth. What's that? \"Go find another job,\" you say? Well, sometimes it's not that easy, especially when you have rent and bills to pay, and you can't really afford to take a gamble on quitting your job in the hopes of finding something more meaningful.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the story of Shane, an office grunt who works at Red Cherry Bicyclery producing excellent video content that not only brings eyes to the product, but also a lot of cash in the form of ad revenue. Of course, the vile Mr. Cuoc doesn't care about any of that, because so long as he's lining his pockets with more green, it doesn't what happens to his employees!</p>\n<p>Death at Nine to Five is a short text adventure experience that runs you through Shane's 90-day probationary review. You'd think this would be the time for a raise, right? Well, think again!</p>\n<p>Note: Death at Nine to Five is part biographical/part autobiographical. I have taken the recent experiences of both myself and close friends at a 9-5 job where we were all miserable. It was hell. I hope you are as frustrated playing this game as we were living it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77cc39df8d8267db930fa1de62b66c4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greasy Beagle Game Manufacture"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
