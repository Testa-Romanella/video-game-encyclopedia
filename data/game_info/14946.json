Then, it presents itself in a much more focused game that gets you into the action easier and faster. 4089 takes more influence from the roguelike genre &amp; has more emphasis on stealthy elements than ever before.<br/><br/>You'll be able to battle &amp; sneak through a procedurally designed ship. Hack cameras &amp; locked doors. Build walls for cover. Break down secret walls to discover new paths. Choose whether you are playing for the full adventure, or just a quick challenge.
