Each would have their strengths and weaknesses. You main goal would be to conquer fortresses but unfortunatly i have not yet achieved this level of skill, so, for now, we have this amazing super \"balanced\" clicker game. Its horrible, but playable.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T02:52:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/315574c55117606719cc74ac04be3d02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pupulor"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
