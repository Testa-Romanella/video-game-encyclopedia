The celestial forge creates some of the rarest, most precious resources in the universe. However, these novas are particularly hot and take a while to cool down, preventing ships from entering and mining the resources.</p>\n<p>Once, an Enryonian engineers a ship able to reach the nova. Despite these inventions, the leadership doubt them. The Enryonian is thus forced to explore the star by themselves. Despite this, they are determined to bring back crucial data and prove the Enryonian leadership wrong.</p>\n<p>Pilot a specialized nova-diver ship in <em>The Novavis</em>, where you'll learn to fly a spaceship not meant for starfighting, but more meant for exploration. Find waypoints, chart them and bring them back to the leadership to prove to them that your ship works.<br/>-<br/>This game takes 8-20 minutes to complete, and is played with a mouse and keyboard. All keybinds are instructed to you by the game.<br/><br/>The game can be downloaded and has a fullscreen, but no audio controls within the game.
