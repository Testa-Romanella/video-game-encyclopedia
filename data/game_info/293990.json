It's a Super Mario-styled platformer. There are 2 teams of mobs that battle for the control of several flags in the level. The flags can be captured and respawn mobs. Each team has a limited number of respawns and loses if they lose the control of all flags or they lose all respawn points. Inspired by Battlefield 2142.</p>Controls<p><strong>WSAD</strong> or\u00a0<strong>Arrow keys</strong> for movement and jumping</p><p><strong>R</strong> for restarting the game (or reload the browser)<br/></p><p><strong>Spacebar</strong> for spawning<br/></p>\r\nStatus\r\n<p>This project has been canceled long ago. However, I love the concept and would like to re-implement it again in the future.
