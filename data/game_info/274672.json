Sacrifice the Grand Vizier of the house that has lost your favor, or just take the head of the winner because you're a demon that's what demons do.</p>\n<p><strong>Cultists get progressively more devout</strong> and come up with ever greater methods of trying to get past you and throw themselves into lava so that they can die for you. But don't let your guard down, if they expose you as a false idol then they will die but in a different way which somehow is less good. Or bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Stick / WASD</strong>\u00a0: Move</p>\n<p><strong>Right Stick / Arrows</strong>\u00a0: Aim/rotate</p>\n<p><strong>Fire / Space,Z,X</strong>\u00a0: Hold to bring up your shield and charge your hammer.</p>\n<p>When you release the fire button when the hammer is charged, you'll smash your hammer down knocking enemies back. If enemies touch your shield, you will drink their souls. Drink 5 souls and you can <strong>throw</strong>\u00a0your hammer, killing enemies for points. Bounce your hammer back repeatedly to increase the score multiplier.</p>\n<p>At the end of every wave, select one House for sacrifice. They will grow in their passion to jump in the lava, and you will get a reward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e667f1bc3ae3891c96a1ea702dbc69c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Triger Mountain"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
