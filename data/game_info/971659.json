With it, you can partake in Vagrus \u2019s massive expansion, as well as survive and thrive in numerous new, exciting locations across the Riven Realms and beyond. The Season Pass grants access to the Sunfire and Moonshadow expansion, along with two upcoming DLCs when they release, for a lower combined price than they would cost individually.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSunfire and Moonshadow<br/>\nVagrus \u2019s first expansion, Sunfire and Moonshadow, offers a new, vast region to explore complete with a swathe of new settlements, new enemies to conquer, new stories to be a part of, a large cast of characters, and new quests to complete through which the vagrus may make their mark on Xeryn. With all this, as well as the introduction of a central conflict involving three new factions \u2013 the Ahari, the Chimera Legion, and the Handjari \u2013 the expansion features content approaching half the size of the core game.<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nUnannounced Companion DLC<br/>\nThe two companions in this upcoming DLC are antagonistic toward each other. Whose side are you going to take and what new paths these two will lead you down? We aim to release this DLC in the first half of 2024.<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\nUnannounced Region DLC<br/>\nThis upcoming DLC is adding a smaller region in size than the Bronze Desert, but an intriguing one nonetheless, with a lot to discover. We aim to take a fundamentally different approach here, introducing new mechanics and offering exciting new ways to interact with these parts of the Riven Realms. The release of this DLC is expected to be towards the end of 2024.<br/><br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nWe will update this page with more details about each of the unannounced DLCs when the time is right.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nNote from Lost Pilgrims:<br/>\nIt is no secret that by purchasing the Season Pass, you are greatly supporting the development of Vagrus by buying content ahead of its release.
