As you collect a star an entity from subspace appears and starts to chase the ship. As you keep on collecting stars, more entities appear and follows the first entity, creating a longer and longer tail that upon collision with the ship will destroy it.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to avoid the tail for as long as possible while collecting stars. Scattered around the universe, you'll find power-ups that can be used to your advantage. Some can destroy the entities chasing the ship, doing so creates more stars and gives bonus points.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Easy controls.
