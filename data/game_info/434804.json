But right before the jam started, my computer broke. So that gave the inspiration to make a game where you have to keep your computer alive instead of the character.</p>\n<p>So everytime you shoot or you get shot by the enemy, the computer starts to overheat, and it cools down if you're not shooting. It cools down even quicker if you're not moving at all. The aim of the game is to play a top-down shooter and try to balance stopping to cool down and shooting your enemy.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it. Feel free to leave me any feedback. I'd love some constructive criticism so I can make a better game next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:33:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ea/3ea1315bd542d29a0693c793f409202b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Slimburger"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
