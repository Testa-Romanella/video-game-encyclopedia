{"id": 47254, "slug": "solar-lander", "name": "Solar Lander", "name_original": "Solar Lander", "description": "Solar Lander is designed to be a 2D space \"simcade\" (mix between a simulation and an arcade game) where players fly around in an Apollo-style lander, land on the surface of a planet, and then redock with the command module to advance to the next level.  You start out in orbit around a planet and docked with the command module.  It is your job to make a safe landing on the surface of the planet, then get back into orbit to redock with the command module.  Each planet has it's unique characteristics based on real life planetary bodies with procedural terrain generation.  Because this game takes place in space, there is absolutely no sound in this game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/435/435da490c760456ae5f28d23a63502c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TChapman500"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["TChapman500"], "esrb_rating": null}
