{"id": 100533, "slug": "hyper-neon-fishing", "name": "Hyper Neon Fishing", "name_original": "Hyper Neon Fishing", "description": "<p>Hyper Neon Fishing is a fast paced beat'em up aquatic creature collection and aquarium simulator game. The player takes control of a diving bird equipped with a disco ball helmet which they use to lure aquatic creatures. Players have the choice to kill the aquatic creatures or capture them for their aquarium. The art style is hyper neon with wacky aquatic creature design.</p>\n\n<p>WHY HYPER NEON FISHING?</p>\n<p>Everyone on the team are college students. Most of us attend Champlain College and are a part of their super awesome game development program. During our Game Production 2 class where were tasked to come up with 50 different game ideas on the spot in class. One of the ideas we came up with was Hyper Neon Fishing. The name and idea really excited us- a game where the player uses funky fresh disco neon dance moves to attract fish. We prototyped a few other ideas, but both our QA testing and our personal interest lead us to making Hyper Neon Fishing.
