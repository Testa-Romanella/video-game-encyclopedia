Synco's melodic world has been overtaken with syncopation, unruly entities that cause disruption in the melodies of the land.</p>\n<p>Become Synco and let the instruments of the melody guide you as you follow the music to jump and skip to the right path and slay your enemies to restore melodic order.</p>\n<p>In version 2 we added a 3rd level for testing purposes. Hope you guys will enjoy it!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong>Mia Katarina Andric - Lead designer, music composition<br/>Leonora Bryndum - Designer, project manager<br/>Amadeja Spes - Lead visual artist, designer<br/>H.
