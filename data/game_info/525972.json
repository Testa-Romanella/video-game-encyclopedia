The collisions and the player's joints are still buggy so I\u00a0hope to figure that out at some point lol, and I probably\u00a0will restart again before I\u00a0try putting it up on app stores just to clean it up. But\u00a0I\u00a0am happy with the progress\u00a0:) please comment or dm me with feedback if you have any!</p>\n<p>Keyboard controls - left for arch, right for straight, space to tuck, up to let go, and R\u00a0for reset</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-12T02:30:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b4/9b4e72e4b206cc471066cfd5620afd50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["iOS", "Web"], "developers": ["jamesnorth", "Matthew Jones"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Matthew Jones"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
