But the game will not hold your hand.<br/></p>\r\nIn your own pace\r\n<p>The puzzles start easy but become extremely challenging. Stuck? Take another path for the time being and return later with a new perspective. Or, don\u2019t return at all! The hardest puzzles are completely optional.</p>\r\nNo tricks required\r\n<p>The game is purely \u2018turn based\u2019. No feats of timing, quick reactions or dexterity are needed!</p>\r\nRelax\r\n<p>Messed up? With practically unlimited undo and level reset, it is never an issue.</p>\r\nAnd be amazed\r\n<p>As the impossible becomes possible before your eyes.</p>\r\nIn the future\r\n<p>For now, I want to keep working on this project when I find the time. Some things I have in mind, besides general refinement and bug fixing:</p>\n<ul><li>A map to keep track of unsolved puzzles</li><li>NPCs</li><li>NPC quests</li><li>More puzzles that combine Movable Objects and Rising blocks</li><li>Brand new mechanics</li><li>Adding more and better 3D models</li></ul>\r\nInterested?\r\n<p>Follow The Court Of Wanderers on Itch and sign up for the mailing list for the latest news!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T03:37:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e03/e031e7016cf19d066c92d27a0de39a59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Comrad S"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
