{"id": 500972, "slug": "the-bards-tale-itch", "name": "The Bard's Tale (itch)", "name_original": "The Bard's Tale (itch)", "description": "<p>Welcome to The Bards Tale, a story of a mighty prince, Matis,\u00a0seeking to marry a princess and unite two major powers under a commonwealth: The Rudawa and Arcadia Kingdoms!\u00a0Everything is fine until a sorceress puts him in a time loop a day before his wedding, hoping he will perish, breaking the bond. Can you help Matis escape his fate and restore order to the medieval kingdoms of Rudawa and Arcadia?</p>\n\n<p>In this game you have a time limit to complete the story or the day is reset. You <strong>will</strong>\u00a0get reset a couple of times which is absolutely normal as the game relies on you remembering how to perform tasks, in order to complete it faster. That is how I implemented the theme anyways.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made\u00a0for the\u00a0<strong>Ludum Dare 47 Compo</strong>\u00a0challenge. The theme was \"Stuck in a loop\".</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/the-bards-tale<br/></p>\n<p>Due to this being made in under 2 days there are probably bugs and improvements that can be made. Please be sure to let me know in the comments section so that I can update this game once the Ludum Dare Compo is finished.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BUG LOG</strong></p>\n<p>Will update once bug reports come in!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>VERSIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Downloadable available - web build coming soon!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Font (in line with Ludum Dare Rules):</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Licensed under the Open Font License</p>\n<p><strong>All remaining assets:</strong></p>\n<p>CursedSoldier</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b39/b39034d969a4420b5adb14d987d4aca8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["CursedSoldier"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
