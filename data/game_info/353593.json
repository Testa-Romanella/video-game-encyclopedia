Another sequel (albeit one that never left Japan), and another overhaul to the survival system. Instead of hydration or cold like in previous games, ZZT3 implements a \u201cstress meter\u201d which goes up as you encounter stressful stimuli. Seeing dead bodies, getting hit with water or fire, and falling down, among other things, will cause the little blue ST bar to increase. As it moves into your green HP bar your health deteriorates, so even if you alleviate stress by drinking water (thereby shrinking the blue bar), you\u2019ll find your HP level also reduced and requiring either a save bench of medkit to restore. In addition, there\u2019s also quite a bit of platforming now, requiring some (usually) fairly easy jumps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-02T08:23:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/427/427421b4746e97cd7af5a30860ed4e6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 404, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PSP"], "developers": ["Irem"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["IREM"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
