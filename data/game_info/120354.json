The theme was to mix two incompatible genres, so I did Clicker/Survival horror. It's not like a typical survival horror, however.\u00a0It may not be running from monsters in an unknown area, but depression is basically a waking nightmare for me. And it takes just as much effort to survive.</p>\n<p>I wanted to convey how stressful and terrifying it is to constantly be battling my own head just perform basic human functions. Depression is a hard and scary thing to live with, so I hope I get my message across with this game.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ca/7ca0b0646f1e56d3c3c99f6238ac3eca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mercilis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
