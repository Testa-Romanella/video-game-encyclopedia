Most of the core gameplay is finished, but there's no win condition yet so basically infinite laps. <br/>Just thought that I've been the only one looking at it for long enough, I'd love to get some eyes on it to see what people think.</p>\n<p>There's no menu but there is controller support so your gamepad should work. Press ESC or Gamepad Menu button\u00a0when you're finished playing.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Keyboard - WSAD, Shift (boost), Space (Jump), C (Change Camera).<br/>Gamepad - Left Thumbstick, Right Trigger (Gas), Left Trigger (Brake), A\\X (Boost), Y/Triangle (Camera), X\\Square (Jump).</p>\n<p><strong>System Requirements:<br/></strong>Sorry, only Windows support right now.
