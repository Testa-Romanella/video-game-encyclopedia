Who are they? Tieflings, the outcasts of the civilized world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living channels of elemental energy, tamers of wild power - who are they? Kineticists, masters of occult elemental skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A mysterious stranger crosses the threshold of your barony - marked with the blood of devils, gifted with the power of the elements. Who is she? Discover for yourself!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new DLC for Pathfinder:Kingmaker includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\u2022  A new playable race.&lt;/strong&gt; During the poll to decide which bonus race we were going to add to the game, one particular option was requested a lot (besides the winner - Aasimars): Tieflings, the people with a drop of demonic blood in their veins. They didn&#39;t make it into the base game, but became the natural choice for the first piece of post-release content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u2022  A new playable class.&lt;/strong&gt; They master the raw power of the elements, channeling it into their wild talents to manipulate the world around them. Kineticists are living conduits of primal energy, deadly both in close and ranged combat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u2022   A new companion&lt;/strong&gt;. If you combine a race with a class, you get a character. Welcome your new companion, the Tiefling Kineticist who comes, just like every other companion, with her own storyline. She could also be a romance option and may hold one of the positions in the Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new companion will join your party in the beginning of Chapter 2. Those who would like to add the companion to their current playthrough can do so at any point before the end of Chapter 5 (&quot;War of the River Kings&quot;): the companion will ask for an audience at your throne room. However, we would advise to begin your acquaintance with the character as soon as possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-08T14:27:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/adf/adf8cfcd8d5fa8e69b0e2e2b07dafbf3.jpg", "website": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/900447/Pathfinder_Kingmaker__The_Wildcards/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 278, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Owlcat Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Deep Silver"], "esrb_rating": null}
