And addictive. And not as simple as you might thing from the description. The only feature that is IMO absolutely required, but missing is the ability to pan the view around. The game is technically all about finding an optimal path that short enough and have number of collectibles maxed. But you can only rely on the very restricted field of view and pathfinder. I wouldn't mind at the very least have some kind of predicted pathfinder, see where it will path if I'll go there. Right now deviation from the main route is always a gamble. There can be different path from that nook, then you are fine, or it can be dead end and then you are screwed. There were roguelikes without combat, there were roguelikes about getting from point A to point B as fast as possible, but in this format, probably not. Let's call it moderately innovative. But I think there could be much more to the game. More upgrades, some way to hinder AI players... As much as the game tries to squeeze into formal rouguelike definition, I think it is too shallow to be called true roguelike.\"</em></li><li><em>\"Run to the Stairs is a tidy, small game that adds some nice gamifications around a simple central mechanic. And a quick note up front before discussing the game proper, the author has done a lot around the central game to add to the experience of play: there is a long and interesting description of the mechanics on the game\u2019s page, there are clear information panels in the game itself, and the author has also implemented a sort of bespoke leader board on the itch page, all of which add to the experience. The core mechanic of this game really worked for me \u2013 using diagonal movement and player decisions to outsmart pathfinding AI. I also think that it was wise of the author to focus on refining this central premise, rather than trying to add too many bells and whistles. The inclusion of the \u201cfastest\u201d line, the granular calculation of racers\u2019 speed, and the simplicity of the power ups all contribute in a clear way to the central experience of racing. I did find myself wishing for slightly more visual polish. The choice of typeface for the ascii-characters I found particularly sharp and vertical, and the colors could have been chosen with more care. More substantially, because the game hinges so completely on moving across corners, some visual indication of the grid would have helped ease the eyes, rather than having rooms and walls exist as just large contiguous sections of black and grey. Regardless, this game is definitely worth a play. \"</em></li><li><em>\"An interesting take on the RL genre, and a well executed one. Little techniques and tricks here and there to get the advantage and good use on the nitro makes it very fun and interesting to play. I would say that it feels overwhelming the more you play by placing the enemy units way ahead and also giving them an increased scaling speed over you that can be really hard to beat. Strategy can take you so far, since you can't see far ahead to calculate better paths and if upgrades worth your position investment. Overall I had a great time playing and it's a concept I would love to see improved on and grow into an actual game.\"</em></li></ol>\n<p>I wanna thank the judges for the detailed and constructive feedback!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The reviews of all the exciting\u00a0games in the challenge can found on\u00a0http://roguetemple.com/7drl/2019/. I want to congratulate\u00a0<em>dungeonyak</em>\u00a0for winning the challenge with his imaginative game\u00a0<em>Inner Life</em>\u00a0- a\u00a0well deserved victory!</p>\r\nNon-official reviews\u00a0\r\n<p>I also wanna share with you this very nice\u00a0comment\u00a0by\u00a0owlmoth\u00a0about\u00a0which I am very happy:</p>\n<p><em>\"I've been playing a lot the last few days, this is my best score so far. It's a very creative take on the roguelike mechanic to not be combat-based, but stays true to the spirit by\u00a0maintaining all the high points of the genre like resource management, unlimited replayability, and \"weighty\" risk vs. reward\u00a0choices - trying to decide if it's worth detouring for a power-up feels meaningful in the context of the game. The gameplay is also a lot snappier than you'd expect from a turn-based game, another departure from the norm that just works really well here. This is what indie games are all about for me;\u00a0taking some risks, making some less-common design choices, leaving the beaten path\u00a0and finding a fun little mechanic off in the weeds somewhere.\u00a0 If I could add anything, it'd only be an 'instant replay' feature; to be able to go back\u00a0after the end of\u00a0a level and rewatch the race in 'real' time. Thanks for sharing this with us!\"</em></p>\r\nPost challenge development\r\n<strong>Version</strong><strong>Description</strong>v0.0Submitted version for the\u00a0\u00a07DRL Challenge 2019v0.1- New alternative controls for people lacking a numpad (WASD-QEZC-mode)\r\n- The probability of opponents getting confused has been decreased.\r\n- Opponents now change color if they get confused.\r\n- Opponents already start with some grand-prix-points in order to make it more challenging for the player to climb up the rankings.\r\n- Some colors have been changed.v0.2The player can now dig tunnels!\u00a0\r\nFor this purpose a new collectible item called \"drill\" was introduced which enables the player to remove one wall element by bumping into it.\u00a0\r\nThe possibility of digging allows the player to take greater risks when taking alternative routes, since this will enable him to rescue himself by spending some resources (drills) if his route decision\u00a0turns out to be wrong.v0.3- The game now plays music composed by\u00a0Dekkanoid. I am absolutely blasted by what this Australian guy created in just few hours!\u00a0\r\n- The game now emits one out of 3 burning sounds (random choice) on each step the player takes while burning a nitro.\u00a0\r\n- I moved the players position on screen towards left in order to increase the field of view since the player mainly moves from left to right.\u00a0\r\n- Some fixes regarding sound effects.\r\nPlans for the future\r\n<p>I consider to implement the following things:</p>\n<ul><li>Different tilesets for different groups of levels to give each of them a different theme.</li><li>Providing different music-tracks fitting the themes of the levels.</li><li>Implementing a server-sided back-end to manage leaderboards and collect statistics.</li><li>Implementing an achievement-system.</li><li>Particle effects for nitros and when digging.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-12T04:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24aaf973303c10499b165e34351228a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gerhard Wonner"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
