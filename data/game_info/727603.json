To take off, push any button and wait until the takeoff speed is reached\u00a0(green indicator on speed gauge).</p>\n<p>The main goal is to fly through the levels destroying all marked targets. To destroy targets, you could either drop bombs on them or fire them with machine guns.</p>\r\nCheck the controls for dropping bombs and fire the machine gun. Remember that the aiming could be improved holding the respective button: <strong>holding bomb button shows the predicted spot</strong> for the bomb to impact and <strong>holding the fire gun button will switch to first person view</strong>!\r\n<p>If you destroy all the level\u2019s targets, you were able to start the next level when landing on the runway, otherwise you need to do it again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your airplane consumes fuel as it flies, so check the gauges frequently. <strong>Also, if the player airplane gets hit by the enemy fire it will suffer different damages</strong>: fuel leakage, unstable flying movement, unable to show bomb drop aiming, gun over heating or motor failure. Landing on the runway will repair the airplane and refuel the tank.</p>\r\nTips:\r\n<ul>\n<li>The bomb aim guide works better when the airplane is flying horizontally.</li><li>The first-person view when firing the guns to strafe will be canceled when the machine gun overheats, so check the gauge to avoid it. Once overheated, you will need to wait to fire again.</li><li>To land safely, approach the runway from a low altitude (but away from the ground), softly maneuvering, trying to maintain the airplane orientation as horizonal as you can. Once inside the runway space, the airplane will land itself automatically.</li><li>If you\u2019re pursued by an enemy plane, try to move frequently in every direction avoiding direct gun sighting. Wait until the enemy change his behavior to attack it from behind.</li><li>If two or more targets are far away and destroying them seems difficult, look for flammable pipelines connecting them that could ignite some chain reactions!</li><li>When out of fuel or when the motor is damaged, gaining altitude is impossible. Glide through the levels without losing too much height, using the controls carefully until reaching the next runway.</li><li>Consider that while parked on runways repairing and refueling, bombers could attack you! To suspend repairing and refueling, and takeoff, push any button.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T04:57:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd9/bd96ebd0e6f721ac1bea891d900964b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RunStopReady"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
