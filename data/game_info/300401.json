If you play randomly, there's about a 1/4 chance of finding the Extra Credits \"Walpole\" Easter egg.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-08T04:38:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8e/a8e93cf924a35e39d1f3365d16f97220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neil Dickson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
