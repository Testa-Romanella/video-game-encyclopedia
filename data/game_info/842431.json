{"id": 842431, "slug": "command-heroes", "name": "Command Heroes", "name_original": "Command Heroes", "description": "In Command Heroes, you control a Hero from one of many Factions in the game each with unique abilities, equipment, and perks to unlock.  Battle it out in a mash-up between a twin-stick action platformer &amp; RTS blend.  Unlock new units, weapons, buildings, &amp; equipment.  Upgrade your crew between matches, and press onward towards victory!  Team up with up to 3 friends for 4-player split-screen action, or set up a custom sandbox map with up to 10 players &amp; AI.<h3>Factions</h3>Each faction has diverse units, buildings, weapons, and heroes.  Shift and shape your strategy accordingly.  Surprise your enemies with unlimited play-style approaches.  Will you attack from above, below, or both?  Whether you approach with style &amp; finesse or overwhelm by brute force, you\u2019ll be faced with new challenges and find new strategies each match.<br/><br/><h3>1-10 Multiplayer Co-op or Versus</h3>Play solo, or with 1-4 local players (or online players via Remote Play Together) in a hectic resource race.  Set up custom matches with full flexibility on team alliances between players &amp; AI.  Up to 10 players &amp; AI total.<h3>Game Modes:</h3><strong>Campaign</strong><br/>Embark on a rogue-like run, with limited crew and starting equipment.  Grow in power, level up, and recruit (or lose - sad face) crew members as you progress and face mini-bosses.  Customize, swap, and upgrade equipment for your hero and crew between missions.  <br/><br/><strong>Survival Mode</strong><br/>Fend off waves of enemies with a brief respite to repair &amp; build.  Team up with other players to survive together.  How many waves can you survive?  Try to beat your personal best.<br/><br/><strong>Custom</strong><br/>Set up sandbox matches for 1-4 players, against 0 - 7 enemy AIs.  Fully configure team alignments, factions, and various other match settings &amp; environmental factors.<br/><br/><strong>Capture the Flag</strong><br/>Capture the enemy team's flag(s) and protect your own!  A throwback to classic arena fighters.<br/><br/><strong>And more to come!</strong><br/><br/><h3>Dig Deep</h3>Head underground or to orbiting moons to discover artifacts of mystical or technological power which can help turn the tide in your team\u2019s favor. Summon an ancient stone golem, an orbital satellite strike, or dozens of other sources of destruction, healing, wealth, and power.  Defend artifacts once revealed or that power can fall into your enemy\u2019s hands.  All teams are notified when a high value Artifact has been detected, so they can race to the location arena and battle for control.  Perhaps instead, you will use this chance to strike your enemy's base on the surface while they are busy claiming the Artifact.<h3>Trader</h3>Don't miss this visitor!  When you hear someone transmitting on open channels, ride your personal shuttle to dock and check out the 'wares (it will be well worth your while...).<h3>Levels, upgrades, items, and artifacts, oh my!</h3>Everything can level up, between your hero, crew, buildings, and weapons.  Discover or purchase items that power up your hero or weapons with status effects like:<br/><ul><li>Health Regen<br/></li><li>Ignite / burn damage over time<br/></li><li>Chain lightning - damage and spread to nearby enemies<br/></li><li>Poison<br/></li><li>Slow<br/></li><li>Stun<br/></li><li>and more...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T03:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e5fc834baee92ed12985e2f10369410.jpg", "website": "https://vciouslabs.com/games/command-heroes", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["VCIOUS Labs"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VCIOUS Labs"], "esrb_rating": null}
