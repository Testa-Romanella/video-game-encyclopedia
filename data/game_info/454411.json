I worked on this beautiful game with two of my friends actually, and I must say making games in teams is much more fun than solo development. This is a submission to the MashUp\u00a0Game Jam but will probably make the prototype for a future game where we'll\u00a0just expand, like, <strong>everything</strong>. Although, the recommended format was a browser game but I\u00a0simply didn't have time to build it properly. But it's only about 19 MB, so it shouldn't be that bad. Anyway, have fun with the game and We would <em>love\u00a0</em>to get some feedback in the comment section.</p>\n<p>P.S. the game will get updates</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T09:00:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/866/866d6a1c9478403b26352d37156b9b16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CactusCoder131"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
