If you've never played it before, Mancala will take you just minutes to learn, but it will take a lifetime to master as you need to exercise good judgement, patience and lateral thinking with every move.<br/><br/>The board is made up of six pits per player. <br/>The number of starting stones is placed in each of these pits equally. <br/>Each player has a store to the left or right of the board. This is where the stones are deposited and can't be removed. <br/>The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on their side.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:31:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e19/e19a98aa51eeb2071956ddadc52a400f_5ZsdWCW.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Yi Min Shen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Yi Min Shen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
