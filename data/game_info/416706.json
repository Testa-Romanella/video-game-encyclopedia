Initially I wanted the paddles to be controlled by different players so that it was a duel of sorts, but multiplayer was not implemented in time. Still, I think this serves as a proof of concept, and the next steps would be to get the multiplayer working, and make all elements of the board able to be moved around one at a time. Could make for an interesting Pinball Duel!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:40:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f0/9f02ec3fc5e4180b420cfee1c5336880.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["daners88"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
