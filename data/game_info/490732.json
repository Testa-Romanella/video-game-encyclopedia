The climate had gone crazy, lack of rainfall had turned the whole world into a huge desert. Even weirder\u2026 Nights are extremely frosty.

Go on an adventure of a lifetime in your old pickup truck. Remember to bring plenty of fuel, food, and drinks.<br/><br/>Traverse the never-ending desert searching for provisions. Look for fuel, fix the engine, pay attention to the battery, change the turbo charger! Take care of and maintain your lifeline. Explore abandoned buildings, sell the objects you find, check the condition of your car. Collect provisions and hide them at home!<br/><br/>Don\u2019t forget to tend to the battery in your car\u2026 When the night comes, your car is the only place where you can hide from the heavy cold.
