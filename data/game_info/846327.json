We only develop games that embrace that era, aiming to provide true classically styled gaming, with a massive retro feel, maybe with a slight hint of what these games would have been with a little more processing power.<br/><br/>We don't aim to develop AAA games, but simply to bring our passion for a time gone by to those who love truly classic themed and inspired games. If this is a genre and era that you love, then our games are for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T04:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/436/4366ccc5bc63315565f1ae3432cb711f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JimJams Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["JimJams Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
