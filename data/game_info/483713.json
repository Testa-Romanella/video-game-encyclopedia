Versus\u00a0is a 2-player top down shooter that is exclusively a versus mode.\u00a0 Each player has up to 8 characters controllable at any time.\u00a0 Whoever has soldiers standing at the end of the battle wins.\u00a0 There are a few different weapons in the game that allow for different strategies.\u00a0 The levels are symmetrical so it will be even for both players.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are pink areas in levels 1 and 4\u00a0that allow you to hide your characters, but they provide no physical protection.\u00a0\u00a02 gamepads are pretty much necessary to play the game effectively because right now\u00a0the joystick is the only input used for rotating the characters.\u00a0 I've only tested it with Xbox 360 controllers, but I'd expect that it'd work with most modern gamepads.\u00a0 This is a prototype slapped together quickly from another project, please feel free to offer thoughtful criticism or advice for the game.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTE:\u00a0 There are graphics that indicate the button used to select characters, they are currently using the PlayStation buttons, so if you see X, O, Triangle, and Square on screen, those correlate to A, B, Y, and X on an Xbox controller, respectively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T05:12:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bde/bde03d3b0adc596513c260032d03d6ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cien Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
