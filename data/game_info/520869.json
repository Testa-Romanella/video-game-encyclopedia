Questions like \"If 3 and 6 teamed up to bake a cake together, what flavor would it be?\"* Names of friends and characters were entered. Answers written and shared. Feelings experienced.</p>\n<p>This generator will assist in the creation of such questions (and feelings). Originally a small browser project from my DeviantArt gallery, we now live in a world void of the  Flash Player plugin. It is high time for a sequel - bigger, better, less-brokier! But until that happens, have a downloadable version of the classic.</p>\n<p><strong>PC users:</strong> Simply unzip and execute. (Did that sound dirty?)</p>\n<p><strong>Mac users:</strong> Please tell me if the download works. I have no idea.<br/></p>\n\n<p>*Cake flavor question ironically not included in this generator.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T04:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f14/f14ec198d0f53ad769daf2c6876b1f08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["McT421"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
