You'll need to dodge, dash and fall through platforms to avoid being crushed by the terrible low pressure at the top of the ocean.  You'll play as Aurora the Angler fish who has a hunger for just about anything that moves.  the Midnight zone is a very cut throat place to live so watch out for any other sea creatures you come across that might slow you down.  This Hyper casual platformer is great to play if you're bored at the office or you're waiting for a multiplayer queue and have nothing else to do!  With a killer sound track and addicting \"can't put it down\" game play.  Midnight Zone will have you up until the midnight hours.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T07:16:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/acd/acdbfaf22d8beee6fb11d759373b821c.jpg", "website": "https://www.packagegamesstudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Package Games Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Package Games Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
