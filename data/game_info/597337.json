If you're okay with that, please continue. The build isn't as polished as I'd like it to be because of a serious medical problem that impeded my work halfway through the semester. I was also working on this while my step dad was in a coma due to\u00a0COVID, so it's a little janky in areas. Please don't try to escape the level,\u00a0I haven't done anything to prevent players from doing so and I know it's very possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T03:36:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd2923b232e1381b6697a950ddb4745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JCstock"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
