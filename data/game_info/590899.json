Topics discussed will include but are not limited to identity and self-perception, appearance, marriage, duties, and belief.</p>\n<p><em>Final Project for HIST1835A: Unearthing the Body: History, Archaeology, and Biology at the End of Antiquity, Spring 2021.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Some notes:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Some choices/variables may change between playthroughs, so try a few times to see if you get something different!</p>\n<p>The Image Gallery contains cards that can be unlocked by discovering special routes! Even if you reach \u201cGame Over\u201d, these will remain visible so you can collect them over multiple tries. The illustrations took 9+ hours to make so please enjoy\u2026 The theme of the cards is not really related to Late Antiquity at all- it is purely for aesthetic purposes. The same goes for the illustrations, which are meant to be more symbolic than realistic. Likewise, a lot of the illustrations in the game are quite inaccurate as I took plenty of artistic liberties.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Egeria's route reaches the maximum number of destinations on Google Maps. Thus, the final route depicts her going from Seleucia of Isauria (modern-day\u00a0Silifke) to Chalcedon (modern-day\u00a0Kad\u0131k\u00f6y). However, she documented herself returning to Tarsus from Seleucia of Isauria before proceeding to Chalcedon.<br/></p>\n<p>Lastly, there are 250+ passages. There are bound to be some (many) historical accuracies- please reach out if you have any corrections! Also, Twine does not indicate spelling/grammatical errors so please excuse any inconsistencies.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T11:40:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75d4d5c46eb7e63c133e818d6cb950e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["suki22889"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
