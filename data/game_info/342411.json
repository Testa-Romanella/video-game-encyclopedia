Your character can fire out pneumatic nailgun-style nails to damage enemies and to create climbable platforms.\u00a0To beat the singular level, eliminate all enemies in the stage.</p>\n<p>As a new developer, I attempted to create a platformer, which was new territory for me. I created the physics system using solely GML, and that took the brunt of my time. While far more unfinished than I would hope, I learned quite a lot from my experience, and I do hope to tear this apart and rebuild it as a proper work at a later date.\u00a0I enjoyed the process, and cannot wait till my next game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T05:49:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df2/df280a019219f2ed5f4cb5c7a3dd87ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["P2ND"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
