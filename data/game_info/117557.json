That's when you come in! Shout at them to boost their productivity and generate your profits! But remember, your generous efforts at motivation come at a price - the employees will get a little bit stressed by the powerful shouts you make. When their stress reaches their limits... they tend to leave work quickly. And you need them to pay your daily expenses!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSome employees might sometimes go to sleep. That's also where you come in! Charge at them in order to hit them so they wake up! But remember - hitting, slapping or smashing your poor not-asleep workers may slightly stress them out. It motivates them a little bit though. You know, violence is the best motivator.\r\n</p>OTHER FEATURES<ul>\n<li><strong>PRINTER</strong></li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tWork cannot be efficient without a printer! Of course they tend to stop working. Or just turn straight up evil and shoot pieces of papers everywhere and stress your employees. To fix it, just use the classic 'punch it till it drops' solution.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>PHONE</strong></li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tSometimes you may get a phonecall. You may just ignore it, but it gives you a small money penalty if you do. Ignoring your clients never seemed like a good deal. If you decide to pick it up - blabbing about some corporate business nets really nice some profits so watch for these phonecalls! If you are fast enough to reach the phone that is. Yes, we didn't think of a cellphone.\r\n</p>CONTROLS<br/>\n<p>\r\n\tYou move your character using \r\n\t<strong>WASD</strong> and shout nice phrases which motivate them to work by holding <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> and releasing it in the right moment to get the right area of influence for the shout. The shouting has a small cooldown so you don't get your throat sore or stress your employees too fast.\r\n</p>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n\tAmazingly big thanks to Dawid W.
