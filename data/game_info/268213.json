This is a small game made in the space of approximately 6 weeks.<br/></p>\n<p>This game uses the core mechanics of Breakout with the added twist that the paddle is now a baseball bat and the ball has the ability to heat up or cool down based on which side of the bat it hits and what bricks it hits. At max-cold or max-heat, the ball will cause either a row or a column of bricks to be destroyed, respectively. The layout of the bricks is entirely randomised with each play-through.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PLAY IN FULLSCREEN DUE TO UI ISSUES!<br/></strong><strong>Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys to swing the bat left or right, use the mouse to navigate menus.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game will not receive any further updates.<br/></p>\n<p>Team:<br/>Liam Dunstan - Designer, Programmer<br/>Trent Williams - Designer, Artist, Secondary Programmer<br/>Tristan Bondici - Designer, Sound Guy<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d7/7d766f20bb91f6d75308cad7d9c0e295.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["liamcgd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
