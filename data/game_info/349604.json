Meanwhile, in a country mansion in South East England, a group of expert mathematicians are fighting a war of their own, breaking an unbreakable Nazi code... Enigma!<br/><br/>You are William Taylor, an amateur codebreaker working at Bletchley Park. Your job is to construct machines to decrypt German codes and gain intel about the enemy, that intel can then be spent on operations in the run up to D-Day. Failure to sway the war effort in the allies favour in the next two years could spell disaster, but success will surely mean victory and an end to the fighting. Good luck, Mr Taylor.<br/><br/><strong>Join Bletchley Park legend Alan Turing in this unique wartime puzzle game based on real events!</strong><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Tonnes of unique codes to break<br/></li><li>8 different operations<br/></li><li>Branching story with multiple endings<br/></li><li>Full voice acting<br/></li><li>Unlockable freeplay mode<br/></li><li>Steam achievements and cloud saves<br/></li><li>Based on real events and actual wartime operations</li></ul><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04e/04e530f061861d6a10fc6496544b8456.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jack Gloyens"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Flying Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
