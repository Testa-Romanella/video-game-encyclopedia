There's also spells to learn and use and equipment to buy along with training your team. This game has a lot of depth and replayability.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\r\n\tRecruit mercenaries from 22 different fantasy races and classes and manage dozens of fighters as they battle in a variety of different terrains against easy to highly intelligent AI or other player-controlled clans. \r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tTrain and hone each fighter's skill through monthly training as well as directly in combat. Build secondary skills such as dodging, shield blocking and dual wielding as well as attributes such as strength, intelligence, hit points, and magic points. There are 200 items and 42 spells available to equip your gladiators, including armors, bows, weapons, magical staves, and more! As each combatant grows with your clan they will age as well and eventually retire. Careful planning and management of your clan can ensure you never have an off season.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tA complimentary steam key will be provided if you buy the DRM-free version here or at the official website (http://www.battlesofnorghan.com/).\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</strong>.
