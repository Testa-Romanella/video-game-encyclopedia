Suprising result was that on\u00a0 pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of almost constant curvature, local interations of Yamahame waves are governed by nearly the same rules as the rules\u00a0 of \"Conway's Game of Life\" cellular automata. Yamahame waves are dangerous to most lifeforms but they can be tracked/detected by proper equiment or some highly trained duster masters. Casting Yamahame waves is a very rare skill among duster masters as mastering Yamahame waves requires an immensive amount of training even compared to other dusting skills.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <strong>\u00a0 Healing Drift:</strong> Duster masters can keep a short-term memory for the biological integrity of their body and also with some effort they can fast\u00a0 forward the biological recovery period.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Paralyzing Spark:</strong> Duster masters who learnt this skill can remotely cast electrical sparks inside a brain causing its paralysis for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<strong>Entangled Tunneling:</strong> Using entangled bridges, duster masters can transport everthing inside a bubble around their body to another place in near-light\u00a0\u00a0 speed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a83/a832fc1d579ee792dfc4ec5dc8a0c2d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["relativisticcomplexitist"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
