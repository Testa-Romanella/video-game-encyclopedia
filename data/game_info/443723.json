The player can do that by going around the forest and collecting wood logs and bringing it back to the fire. When that happens the fire becomes bigger giving the player more time to go and get more wood logs. There are spiders that chase the player around the forest but they cannot get too close to the fire so the bigger the fire the safer it is for the player. If the spiders catch the player, he loses energy from the life-bar and becomes slower. You can press shift for a boost in speed. It takes a few seconds to recover from that in order to use that function again. When the player is out of energy the game is over.\u00a0Happy playing !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:27:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36e/36e550b860055fdf22ecc6d1e0d98544.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Abid_Gama"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
