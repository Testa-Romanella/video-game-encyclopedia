Careful of lag when you accidentally click some admin button and spawn 16 million enemies. Boss is beatable, I've done it, it's doable. Just try to get behind it and you got it. Those spinning things dropped after a big boi explodes is its pattern, which u can use even after death.</p>\n<p>Please fill in the feedback form after u finish with the game, thanks and do enjoy the gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>Form:\u00a0https://forms.gle/aNAThhj8TUTPsitG6</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T10:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc2597a851a18a492b2a06a6105524f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevashi"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
