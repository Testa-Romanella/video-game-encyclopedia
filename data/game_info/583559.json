He says he has guests coming soon and they need to be able to find their way.</p>\n<p>Your coworkers seem... nice? Okay, maybe not, but Boss says you are not to damage anything, living or unliving--you'll have to find a way to make due. Use your lantern, your wits, and your limited fuel supply to blaze a path through the dark.<br/></p>\n<p><em>Lamplighter is still in the prototype phase, so if you're enjoying the game--or if you run into any issues--let me know below or on Twitter.</em></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Several players have noted the audio comes in pretty loud. Be advised. I will patch it to a lower volume soon (and probably add some sliders, too).<br/></p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\r\nActionKeyboardGamepadMoveArrow keys<br/>Left stick, D-padSelect, Interact<br/>Space/EnterButton 1 (A/Cross/B)<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T23:36:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97b/97b389d5a062dd3754d2fb64062d2c5a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joe Daywalt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
