Developing it was more of a learning process for me rather than making something more enjoyable or detailed since it took me less than 20 hours total to make. Drom is a poorly interpreted game about a series of dreams I had one night. Through making it i learned about UI design, scripting, animation, and more. I also made all of the music myself.</p><p>There's not much to it; walk around, enjoy the scenery, and relax.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b9604698cca215e50f5c40f1d5e86ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Monguku"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
