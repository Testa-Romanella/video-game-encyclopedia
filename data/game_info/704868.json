This is based on line of sight: for instance, an Enemy/AI starts to follow the player, when the player turns and sees the AI the player jumps back and upward. Timing and positioning is rewarded with masks and candy as the player accesses different parts of the level. Masks are collectibles that can be equipped that will either help or stop the player from being warded off by scarers. Accessing certain points in the map will require the use of a mask. The goal is to find your pup and return back home with the pup. Therefore the masks will be useful tools to allow the player to backtrack through the level in order to get back home with their ghostly friend.</p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a rough week for little Orphy. First it was the bullies at school, and then, his old dog, Loop, died and left him behind. And to make matters worse, his least favorite holiday is coming up - All Hallow\u2019s Eve.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\tAfter learning about the history of Halloween in school, Orphy found himself with a new outlook on this horrifying holiday. All over the world, people held festivals and vigils in a similar way, invoking the spirits of the dead. It was then that Orphy began to devise his plan. He would brave the spookiest night of the year, full of monstrous bullies and baddies to find his beloved best friend, Loop.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tCourage has many masks, and Orphy must learn to conquer his fear, as well as use it to his advantage, to be reunited with his passed on pup.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T09:19:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/965/96512e33584af075803a6c3849c9e31b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Silvadollar"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
