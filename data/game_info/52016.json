{"id": 52016, "slug": "rogue-hero", "name": "Rogue Hero", "name_original": "Rogue Hero", "description": "Rogue Hero is a 4 player action rpg with roguelike elements, combining procedural dungeons and an expansive overworld full of secrets. Take down the various dungeons, build up your village, or just fish, farm and swim around Tasos.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRogue Hero features classic top down sword slashing combat with a large set of tools, spells, and weapons at your disposal. Fight through 5+ dungeons each with their own style, room layouts and unique dangers.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDungeons are procedurally generated to connect hand made rooms and mix up the layout so no two runs are the same. Keys, puzzles, and traps are mixed up, even within the rooms things won't always play out the same way. Combining randomization with hand placements gives replayability without the fallbacks of uninteresting design that can come from full random generation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay in solo or in coop with up to 4 players through the entire campaign beginning to end. Build up your village into a bustling community, take down the dungeons that threaten the outer areas and collect tools to open up your world. Max out your Hero and take them into the infinite dungeon to see how they stack up against a never ending onsluaght of enemies, traps, and puzzles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFish, Fight, Farm, Build, Explore there's many things to do in Rogue Hero all with their own progression that feeds into other activities and pursuits.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-21T08:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efc/efc2826d2fcfb54ffb59ea0f88017524.jpg", "website": "http://www.RogueHeroGame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 643}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 30, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 268, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heliocentric Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Heliocentric Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
