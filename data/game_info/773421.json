Because i only made the basic structure\u00a0of the Game. So you can see the graphics, how it will play out and work.\u00a0But there is not much for now, so it can be pretty repetitive.</p>\n<p>But still ! Try it and break it ! Feel free to destroy my game in every way possible and tell me how you do it so i can patch it !
