Drop numbers, break blocks, get huge high scores, and challenge your friends!  As long as you can count to seven you'll love 7 sevens!<br/><br/>The idea is to keep your board clear by creating clusters of the correct number of tiles with the same number on the tile to remove them.  For example, 4 connected fours will disappear.  Gray blocks will also appear and can be cleared by creating adjacent clusters.  <br/><br/>We listened to our users and added in a new helper called Lift, which allows you to pull a tile off the top of a column and reposition it on the board -- great for fixing those misplaced tiles!  We also added the ability to see the next tile coming and adjusted the end game to eliminate too many consecutive gray blocks from raining down on you.<br/><br/>User reviews:<br/><br/>***** \u201cEasy rules &amp; terribly fun, addictive play!!
