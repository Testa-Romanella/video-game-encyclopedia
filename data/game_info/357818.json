However, at some point, the light faded, and it became clear that they were being invaded by the dark relatives. The Sun Palace is so high above the earth that even flying animals, let alone humans, cannot reach it.<br />\nIn the face of an unprecedented crisis, the human king Balgert issued a broad warning: &quot;Restore the legendary stairway of light that leads to the sky and recapture the Sun Palace. Those who achieve it will be rewarded as much as they wish.&quot;<br />\nAnd so the adventure began.<br />\nThis is the 3rd series of the classic 3D dungeon RPG &quot;Erminage&quot; that emphasizes freedom and replayability.
