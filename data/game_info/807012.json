Control the two spirits that create time loops each day.<br/><br/>It's up to you to learn their different behaviors, how they can interact with each other and how these interactions are interfering with the time loops to solve brain-scratching puzzles. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Will you be able to figure out the new rules of the continuum ?<h3>Day &amp; Night, the twins spirits </h3><br/>You control two characters: one during the day, one during the night. They sure look like twins but they have unique behaviors. It's up to you to discover how to use their distinctiveness at your advantage.<h3>Time loop and playback </h3><br/>Each move you do with a character are recorded and will be played back while you're controlling the other character. It's like creating small time loops for each character.<br/><br/>Beware, the playback is not the same for our two spirits: The day-one will rewind its actions and the night-one will replay its own actions.<h3>No pressure </h3><br/>You can't lose and there is no time constraint in the game. If you make a mistake, navigate the timeline and go back in time !", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T17:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/619/61978d3ff623d8b6516384734696fc4d.jpg", "website": "https://www.pandaroo.be", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 26, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pandaroo Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pandaroo Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
