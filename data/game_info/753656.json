You escaped from a lab and scientists are trying to stop you!</p>\n<p>In this game, the screen is your primary resource. It represents your health, and you can split it at will by splitting the blob.</p>\n<p>The blobs and the enemies follow five archetypes. Each one is weak again two archetypes and strong against two others. Figure out which one, and get the best out of your blobs by creating a balanced team!</p><p>The XP bar on the right is divided in several parts, one for each archetype. When you level up, you get a reward depending on the most played archetype. However, you can get only one reward per archetype, so you need to play with all archetypes to get all the rewards!<br/></p>\n<p>(Colorblind players: the game uses various colors to differentiate the archetypes. You can hover blobs and enemies with the mouse to know their archetypes.)<br/></p>\n<p>Thanks and credits :</p>\n<ul><li>Thanks to all the beta testers for their feedback ! </li><li>Thanks R\u00e9my for your very insightful blog</li><li>Music by Robby Duguay</li><li>TinyECS library by KatrinaKitten</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T12:23:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ba/3bac5ebee7d13f70316cd3ac0a4ea905.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cpiod"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
