Cut The Zombie Guts combines the fun of physics based games with action, puzzles, and zombies. Bring the zombie back to life by cutting guts, ropes, and chains to reunite the zombie with his head. But watch out a happy zombie needs to be a dead zombie. Once your zombie is whole, its fatality time. Each level brings a new fatality and a fun way to watch your skills pay off. Bonus: Special appearance by Quacker Monty Duckerson.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbe/fbe5a506b7ff7c0fdf920a4ba1822b5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Terry Hess"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
