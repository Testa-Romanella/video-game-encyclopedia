The feature I aimed to prototype is a temperature-based GUI element in the form of two circles centered on the player: A red circle that indicates overheating (see by pressing F and then spacebar a few times) and a circle that is \"cut out\" of a frosty-looking overlay. This circle will shrink into view as the player stands around without the flame active.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys to move</li><li>F to activate your flame</li><li>Space while flame is active to create a flame whirl.</li><li>Flame whirl \"melts\" snow, revealing rock underneath. </li></ul>\n<p>Known bugs:</p>\n<ol><li>The GUI lags behind the player a bit.</li><li>Pretty sure the cold overlay elements freak out on resizing. </li></ol>\n<p>Aims for the rest of the jam</p>\n<ol><li>A short quest to find a shrine buried under snow. </li><li>Player will fall unconscious and restart at the beginning if temperature reaches -1 (Cold overlay touches the player) or +1 (Heat overlay covers the screen)</li><li>Make the fire-whirl appear to pass behind the player</li></ol>\n\n<p>Player stand-in: Animated Orcs by Calciumtrice, usable under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.
