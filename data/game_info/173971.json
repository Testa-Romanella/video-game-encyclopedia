It was an attempt to translate Arkham [Asylum|City]/Shadows of Mordor style combat into a Roguelike game. I think I largely succeeded.<br/></p>\n<p>As always, I didn't get as far as intended: but, I successfully made the core gameplay loop I wanted to - being the quick jumping between enemies combat, with parrying and dodging, in turn based.</p>\n<p>There was also a lot of experimentation with using Prefabs which, I think, has lead to reasonable level generation.</p><p>The game has a win condition that can be triggered by finding, and killing Zulu.<br/></p><p><strong>Playing the game</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Lack of time has resulted in lack of reasonable statement on controls. You can use number keypad, vi keys, or arrows. Space or 5 waits/parrys, and . always waits (if you have the option to parry, but don't want to).</p><p>Momentum is shown on the left. You gain momentum with successive attacks, and lose it when attacked or when you don't attack.<br/></p><p>When you are being attacked, you can dodge in the opposite direction for the cost of 1 momentum. Alternatively, you can parry most attacks for 1 momentum per attacking enemy by 'wait'ing. <br/></p><p>Your damage is your momentum (minimum 1).<br/></p>\n<p>Source is on github.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/635/6352a50c9846590d22204b1bb1174144.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lachlan Kingsford"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
