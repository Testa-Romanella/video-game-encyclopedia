{"id": 233990, "slug": "beat-champion", "name": "Beat Champion", "name_original": "Beat Champion", "description": "Beat Champion is a VR rhythm game that challenges you in ways unlike other VR rhythm games before it. Beat Champion represents musical notes as colored cubes that you must destroy in sync with the music. HTC Vive and Oculus Rift will be supported for early access.<br/><br/>What makes Beat Champion different is it represents musical notes with 4 colors, not 2. Each hand can destroy 2 colors and are toggled between by the player. Instead of just adding more notes to increase difficulty, Beat Champion challenges your hand and eye coordination, your reaction times, and your memory. Beat Champion also features note direction changes and vanishing notes.<br/><br/>Unique Features<br/><ul><li>Musical notes are represented by 4 colors, not 2, making gameplay unique and challenging in new and fun ways.<br/></li><li>Notes can come from behind you, in front of you, or to the side of you. These direction changes often occur multiple times during a song, but it's obvious to the player when to turn and where to face. <br/></li><li>Notes can vanish after spawning and reappear when closer to you.<br/></li><li>Notes can be destroyed in any manner. Punching them gives you a set score, but punching from other directions (upper cut, left hook, etc) will earn you more points. <br/></li><li>Each fist can destroy two colors. Colors are toggled between while playing.<br/></li><li>Gameplay is extremely enjoyable and often encourages the players to dance as notes are perfectly in sync with the music.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7872b5012e9d6f8ebea7299fa24d42.jpg", "website": "https://www.beatchampionvr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Toast Hotel Game Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Toast Hotel Game Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
