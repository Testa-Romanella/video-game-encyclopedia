The map featured in the game is made by Ethosaur (https://steamcommunity.com/id/ethosaur).</p>\n<p>Necrophobia is a singleplayer game.\u00a0It uses ambiance, lighting and sounds, unexpected events and much more, instead of cheap face jumpscares to give you quite a chill. The game features about 15-20 minutes of gameplay per chapter or more depending on how much you observe the areas or blast right trough them. The game isn't only about horror, however. It also features a bit of puzzle mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/205/2057eeedf64318a77c19b46d9cafbe8f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrNyxx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
