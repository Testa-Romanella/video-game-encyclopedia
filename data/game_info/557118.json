Or at least, that what he would believe.</em></p>\r\nSUMMARY\r\n<p>Language: ENG (English)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Genre: Interactive Fiction</p>\n<p>Target Device: HTML Browser</p>\n<p>Tools: Twine 2 (Harlowe 3)</p>\n<p>Warnings:</p>\n<ul><li>Contain talks about suicide, not recommended for those under psychological care from psychologists or psychiatrists, especially due to stress or depression.</li></ul>\r\nProduct Details\r\n<p>This product is created as a testing ground for me to understand Twine better. The tool offers the potential to allow expansion of this short fan fiction I wrote in the past (thanks to branching), and I decided to do just that.</p>\n<p>Taking the story of Karma's Cruelty written by my alias\u00a0Affad Wisteria, I decided to expand upon the story and gives several approaches to it, including a darker tone I refused to take before. I'm more into giving a motivational approach to life rather than a dark one, so yeah.</p>\n<p>Karma's Cruelty itself is based on Kagazuly's Everlasting Dissonance, which is based on Spike Chunsoft's Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony. I recommend people to try out Danganronpa V3, as well as reading Everlasting Dissonance.</p>\n<p>At Archive of Our Own, the story is most relatable for Everlasting Dissonance readers, but without it, to a degree, it should be relatable enough. Hopefully, this short story will be of enjoyment for you dear players.</p>\n<p>The product will not cost anything, and I do not take donations for this project since that is 'technically' making money from a proprietary creation, so I'm just taking my care here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you want to support me, you can leave a comment, or just join the discord link above. That'll be great. Also, don't forget to support Kagazuly's Everlasting Dissonance if you do, I really appreciate people supporting them for their awesome work.</p>\n<p>For the curious, the image is made with GIMP.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T08:30:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/42e/42e933fe9a88756eb40ed9c7138d43c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Muhammad Daffa Abiyyu Rahman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
