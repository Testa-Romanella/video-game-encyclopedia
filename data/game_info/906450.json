I strongly recommend you skim through it \u00a0and its itch.io page as some elements are explained differently there.<br/></p>\n<p>At the time, I had a lot of difficulty managing Bitsy's wonky conditional dialogue system, and the medium itself forced restrictions in my ideas of game design (which was on purpose).</p>\n<p>By doing this with Unity3D and Ink (https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), things were a lot more manageable, even if it did require quite a bit of integration to get both the engine and the scripting language to communicate effectively.</p>\n<p>It's not\u00a0<em>exactly</em> the same game, as they don't play out the same and the dialogues were re-written from scratch. There are some new characters, some returning, some references to the previous ones.</p>\n<p>But what I truly delved into with the 3D version was my first attempt at scene-building, i.e., combining dialogue, music, animations and other effects.</p>\r\nAnimations\r\n<p>With a mixture of Unity's Animator and a <em>copious</em> amount of C# Coroutines, as well as using Ink #tags to fire them via dialogue events, I tried to manipulate the the player's experience and focus his attention on specific items on screen.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I managed this entirely, and I feel there might be some details and elements that might be missed entirely.</p>\n<p>But that's the thing about details, I suppose!</p>\r\nMusic\r\n\r\n<p>Originally titled after Lee Hazlewood's \"The Night Before\", I was unfortunately unable to understand if I could use the song within my game (through \"fair use\" and non-monetization), and even reached out to the rights-holders, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>I wanted to have some sort of correlation between some of the song's lyrics and items you could interact with (like having him say \"These empty whiskey bottles, they stand accusing from the floor\" in the background while the player finds said whiskey bottles).</p>\n<p>In the end, the looping jazz background works well to give the player a sense of \"cool mystery\" and encourage her/him to explore their surroundings.</p>\r\nDialogue\r\n<p>When Inkle released\u00a0<em>80 Days</em> back in 2014, I instantly loved how they had adapted one of my favorite books from my childhood, <em>Jules Verne</em>'s <em>Le Tour Du Monde en 80 Jours</em> onto the mobile phone format.</p>\n<p>As a fan of role-playing games (both tabletop and virtual) I also played their 4 chapters of <em>Sorcery!</em> released the year before.</p>\n<p>So when I discovered they had developed a scripting language for writing dialogue in video games, <em>and</em> had an integration asset for Unity, I didn't hesitate one second! It truly made my life easier and allowed me to focus more on designing my game rather than developing it efficiently.</p>\r\nAccessibility\r\n<p>My\u00a0previous\u00a0game\u00a0was\u00a0<em>Feta: Skylines</em>, a\u00a0game that was more\u00a0of a\u00a0\"meme\"\u00a0than\u00a0an\u00a0actual\u00a0playable\u00a0experience, and one of the feelings I\u00a0came\u00a0out of its development with was\u00a0that\u00a0accessibility was definitely\u00a0one\u00a0of its\u00a0biggest\u00a0issues.</p>\n<p>With no functional UI, over-reliance on key-binds to build anything, it felt like a game created by a hardcore player for hardcore players.</p>\n<p>With \"The Night Before\" I tried to simplify all interactions as much as possible, basically havig only 5 buttons (to move and interact/pass dialogue).</p>\n<p>Whether or not it helps in any way, I've yet to find out, but it was a focus point I kept at the back of my mind when developing the game.</p>\r\nFinal note\r\n<p>I\u00a0came\u00a0out of\u00a0making\u00a0\"The\u00a0Night\u00a0Before\" quite\u00a0proud of\u00a0the\u00a0game\u00a0I\u00a0had\u00a0created,\u00a0because it\u00a0feels like my first\u00a0\"real\"\u00a0game\u00a0in the\u00a0sense\u00a0that\u00a0it's a\u00a0complete\u00a0experience\u00a0with a\u00a0start and\u00a0finish, as\u00a0well as a more\u00a0adequate\u00a0use of\u00a0Unity\u00a0to\u00a0provide\u00a0a catered,\u00a0almost\u00a0cinema-like\u00a0experience\u00a0to the\u00a0players.</p>\n<p>This is always something I have valued in video games: how they sit between litterature, cinema and play. Perhaps there isn't much <em>play</em> in this one, as that's something I focus on with other of my projects (which you can or will find on my itch.io page), but I really did try to implement a snippet of the other two within the video game genre.</p>\n<p>\"The Night Before\" was developed as a coursework assignment for the \"Approaches To Play\" course at Goldsmiths University (MSc Video Games Programming, 2022/2023)</p>\r\nThanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:45:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f1c9fa83226053d8f3575dfaff3b74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ikonic"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
