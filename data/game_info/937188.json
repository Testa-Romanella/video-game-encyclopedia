While the conditions may not be 100% perfect, the player does get to learn more about short-term/working memory while playing a game that tests their memory. The basis of the game is to test\u00a0 George Sperling's magical number of 7 +- 2, which states that you can hold about 5-9 items in your short-term memory at a time. There has been research that argues that this number is closer to 4, so the player can test this themselves! The player is also prompted to explore topics such as the word length effect, as well as how the complexity of the stimuli effects your ability to remember it.</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Click the Start Button to start the educational experience.</li><li>Click the Easy / Hard button to begin a game in their respective modes.</li><li>Click the images to select them.</li><li>Recommended that sound be on!</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Button Pressed sound and Correct Sound from\u00a0https://souptonic.itch.io/souptonic-sfx-pack-1-ui-sounds</li><li>Images from\u00a0https://game-icons.net/</li><li>Game over sound from\u00a0https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.0/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T11:17:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de588e708084cc7a693e60c6ad0e20de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jackson"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
