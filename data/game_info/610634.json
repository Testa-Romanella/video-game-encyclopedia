These expectations are not always reasonable or accessible.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Many things can factor into marginalizing a person, like race, disability, financial status, food and housing security and location. These things stack up commonly. Like banning plastic straws leads to injury and even death of disabled people and someone living in a food desert cannot just go shop for local organic produce, sometimes ideas and policies are simply too short sighted to be actually sustainable.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>There are accessible ways to think about sustainability. We want to provoke that conversation and encourage a different perspective.\r\n</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\n<ul><li>WASD for movement</li><li>Mouse camera movement\u00a0</li><li>Mouse left click for interaction with objects</li></ul>\r\nThe Quarry Team\r\n<p>Joshua Gundlach<br/>Tony Loon<br/>Natali Panic-Cidic</p>\r\nSpecial\u00a0Resources\r\n<p>Find more about how you can participate in global sustainability development via sdgs.un.org/goals.
