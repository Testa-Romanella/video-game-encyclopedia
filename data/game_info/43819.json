As an unnamed hero you will repeat the feat of Hermod, Oden's son. Descend to the Niflheim and meet the goddess of death \u2014 Hel.<br/><br/>What happens if we mix a classic arcade shooter with a classic hardcore rogue-like?<br/>Reloading? Too hard. You are warrior, not a nuclear physicist.<br/>Health regeneration? Keep it for the babies.<br/>Saves? Death takes everything. Yep. Them too.<br/>It's not an easy walk.<br/><br/>Pistols, SMGs, shotguns, rocket and grenade launchers - all this impressive arsenal is randomly generated. Sometimes you can find something special, with unique properties.<br/><br/>Ancient Crypt, Forest of Giants, Dwarven Dungeons and Castle Helheim (now it's the city, but who cares?) do not share their secrets for free. Every circle of Nordic Hell is crawling with unique foes and gated by the deadly bosses. The bosses guard legendary weapons, giving you more reasons to be an unstoppable killing machine.<br/><br/><ul><li>Classic arcade shooter with rogue-like mechanics.<br/></li><li>Randomly generated and unique weapons.<br/></li><li>Four circles of Niflheim, eight randomly generated levels.<br/></li><li>Brutal boss fights.<br/></li><li>Brutal foes with varied behavior.<br/></li><li>Horned helmets.<br/></li><li>Secrets.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:06:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/1178a85b699808a10501b6c005937cf0.jpg", "website": "https://hermodr.regdaynull.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 262, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Regday NULL"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Regday NULL"], "esrb_rating": null}
