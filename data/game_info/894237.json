Or will you ally yourself with the goddess of death? Drive to Helheim and find out.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is a short Twine game that you can play in your browser. This game originally tried to stay close to the source material, but as I dug deeper, Hel\u2019s character had plans of her own. Do with that what you will.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was inspired by:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>The Devil\u2019s Asshole by Anna Antropy\r\n</li><li>Storyteller Daniel Allison\u2019s retelling of Baldrs draumar\r\n</li><li>Sassafrass\u2019s musical Sundown: Whispers of Ragnarok\r\n</li><li>Moe\u2019s 24h breakfast diner (RIP)\r\n</li><li>a recent visit to a grungy diner (thanks Gab!)\r\n</li><li>Buddy Wakefield\u2019s poem Horsehead\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Naomi Mitchison\u2019s novel Travel Light\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Just as a note, I started writing this game a few days before Ocean Keltoi\u2019s release of the video Hermodr: The Historical Death Knight. I waited until the game was finished and published before watching it, just to ensure that I didn\u2019t steal any of his ideas. Similarly, I happened upon Black Stone Sanctuary\u2019s two essays on Modgud but waited until I was done with the game before reading these works.\r\n</p>\n<p>Story by Cardinal.
