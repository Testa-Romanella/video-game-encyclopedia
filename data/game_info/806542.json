I just thought .JAR files seemed kind of retro, which helps establish the game's setting, so that's why it's in the title.</p>\n<p>The main reason I made this game was to test some things in a program I've been playing around in\u00a0(CopperCube) but hadn't yet made a finished game with yet. This isn't a long game and there isn't a lot of gameplay to it, but it allowed me to learn how do some simple, yet important things in this program: Variables, text overlays, and basically scheduling when I wanted things to happen in the game. It also has sound FX, which a lot of my games to this point have lacked. Not a lot of gameplay, but there are a lot of things on the walls to read.</p>\n<p>There's a subgenre of game I like where it's abandoned MMORPGs and there was a good one recently I really liked that you should also play:\u00a0https://vaporshark.itch.io/holizone</p>\n<p>My game isn't an MMORPG, but the idea is similar because in my game's story, two friends were using the same old phone/internet App to create a shared house together. Then, one of the friends died, while the other kept living and abandoned the old App. Years later, they return to it only to discover their dead friend's spirit is still using the App...and they're not too pleased about being abandoned in it.</p>\n<p>Recently, I heard a\u00a0clue on \"Jeopardy\" that made me think of someone I knew who\u00a0died. Then I thought of the abandoned MMORPG subgenre again and combined those two things. I\u00a0should also mention this game itself was born out of an abandoned project. I drew the original 2D Frank sprite while working on a Nokia Game Jam, only to abandon the project after I realized you actually had to program the game to work on a Nokia, which I did not know how to do. The cover of this project is an edit of\u00a0that original image.</p>\n<p>So, I guess the question of this game is \"What would happen if someone's essence was stuck living in an old, severely-outdated simplistic internet App for 10+ years, all alone?\"\u00a0I imagine they would be pretty bitter.\u00a0I don't fully go into story within the game, but these are the things I was thinking about as I made the game. Somewhat of a warning, the text in this game is crazy and threatening towards the main character. Like, beyond bullying, it's pretty brutal. Bitter ghosts, right?\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is only one ending, but there is a secret room in the game. It's a pretty cool secret room, I\u00a0think.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Adventure Jam 2022:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/jam/adventure-jam-2022</p>\n<p>I would call this an Adventure game because it is an experience in an odd environment which you are free to walk around in, explore, and read texts that fill in who the characters are.</p>\n<p>This game was worked on from June 15-June 17, 2022.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T23:29:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d454b1339b2b50a289a463a6a59dfbe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SnakeWinter"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
