Items can be acquired through the in-game shop and also by completing campaigns.<br/><br/><br/>If your looking for a greater challenge though, be sure to check out endless mode. This mode will for sure challenge your strategy as the waves get progressively harder by both, enemy quantity and enemy variety. So i wish you the best!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Cowboys n' Stuff works for both, Controller (Gamepad) and Keyboard + Mouse.</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T19:02:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/763/763fb9a1ad12cf69f4dd1c44f5ec8d6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Josh Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Josh Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
