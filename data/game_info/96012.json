Feel free to take it apart, use it and abuse it for any of your own games. No credit necessary. It's not exactly well commented, but have at it! All I ask is you show me what you've made.<br/></p>\n<p>But man oh man... GameMaker: Studio sucks for creating 3D games, no wonder people say don't do it!</p>\n<p>In the 2D world, you'll notice a flag to represent a goal. This does nothing other than play a sound currently. There is no point to this \"game\".</p>\n<p>The movement is meant to be reminiscent of old dungeon crawling games like Hired Guns, Captive, Bard's Tale or Whales Voyage. So you only move in \"steps\" and rotate 90 degrees at a time.</p>\n<p>The controls are:</p>\n<p>Left arrow - rotate anti-clockwise<br/>Right arrow - rotate clockwise<br/>Up arrow - move forward<br/>Down arrow - move back</p>\n<p>O - go back to main menu<br/>P - generate a new maze<br/>Esc - exit game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75b/75b63baaa3f613121e54817c59674279.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Bee Bush"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
