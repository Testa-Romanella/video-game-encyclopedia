Fight your way through an onslaught of blocky enemies, from monsters with visors to black and red voids. Once you die in a RUSH, you\u2019ll be able to use rewards that you earn based on your performance to unlock more content such as characters and weapons. Pick a character and weapon combo that fits your playstyle! Can you unlock it all?\r\n</p>\n<p>With 15 total playable characters (8 of which are available from the start) and 14 weapons (6 of which are available from the start), you\u2019ll have a lot of different combinations to choose from. Different characters have different abilities, and also use different amounts of SP (Special Power) for each special attack. And each weapon has a unique bonus. Part of your strategy is finding the right character and weapon combo for the job.\r\n</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen your character and weapon, and begun a RUSH, you\u2019ll be thrown onto a map with three enemies. Walk up to an enemy, and a battle will begin. Winning the battle will award you with one level up, some score, and 1 SP. After you\u2019ve fought some battles, you can walk over to a portal on the map, and you\u2019ll be warped to another map, once again with three enemies. Try to survive as long as possible! The higher the score you get, and the higher the level you reach, the more rewards you\u2019ll get!\r\n</p>\n<p>In the RUSH SHOP, you\u2019ll be able to use rewards you earn from RUSHing to buy characters, weapons, XP, and headstarts. Some items here will have special requirements, such as reaching a certain Player Level first. Once you\u2019ve met the special requirements, you\u2019ll be able to purchase the item.\r\n</p>\r\nRequirements\r\n<ul><li>CPU: Any decent 64-bit processor\r\n</li><li>GPU: Integrated graphics work fine\r\n</li><li>RAM: 2GB or more, 4GB recommended\r\n</li><li>OS: Any 64-bit Linux distribution, 64-bit Windows (10 or newer is recommended), or 64-bit Android\r\n</li></ul>\r\nFAQ\r\n<p>Question: What platforms does Kingdom Come RUSH support?\r\n</p>\n<p>Answer: Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, and Android.
