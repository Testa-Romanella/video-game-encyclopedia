If you have returned back to the menu - that means you successfully finished one of two levels. Thank you\u00a0:)</strong></p><p>My thoughts:</p><p>I didn't have much time to work on a project, and I thought of leaving, but I wanted to make some \"core mechanics\" and make this \"prototype\" my starting point: first time developing game, literally never done it before. And it was nice :) Though the time limit got me frustrated: I felt like a week was long enough, so I was doing a lot of \"anything but making a game\".. ;0 But the burden of \"you have to do it, because you signed for it\".. was really stressful.. (a bit hard to explain). In the end, I decided to post something and hear feedback around the idea. Most sounds are not included due to lack of skills and \"willing time\". Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>Game should have had storyline, in witch you play for the creature - subject of an experiment, that was either trying to finish tests or to escape.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:39:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/587/587f76908662f3369637f5519338f3a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["quanuhs"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
