It was a quick Game Jam that had a turkey based theme. In honor of Thanksgiving, I made a turkey shoot game. It is very simple and mainly made for laughs. I hope everyone likes it and feedback is always welcomed. Happy ThanksGiving Everyone!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credit:</strong> Only one person worked on this game. I did the artwork and design. I used Stencyl as the software for the game design, and I also used a template from Stencyl to base my game on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T08:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a7/1a7a11c62d7cf671647d1694c4b7e6a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Treylatic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
