{"id": 409851, "slug": "opencity", "name": "Opencity", "name_original": "Opencity", "description": "<p>Opencity is a simulation to gauge a player's ability to be good.<br/></p>\n<p>This simulation \u00a0will remain to be a prototype.\u00a0 This will give me a basis for like games\u00a0 in the future.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>--Quick documentation--</p>\n<p>ON:\u00a0PC: W,S,A,D and mouse to pick up items and pin other's</p>\n<p>ON:TOUCH DISPLAYS: The W,S,A,D equivalents are on screen. The gesturing when\u00a0picking up items or pinning them will be different than the PC version. Pressing 'X' makes the player jump.</p>\n<p>Also, Opencity is made for all ages. Therefore, at times the game's play will seem\u00a0redundant or slow. Just change a few options while in the option screen....<br/></p>\n<p>When in the board game room just click where the suitcase stops. Clicking the roll number card has the same effect as clicking the suitcase.. The board game is totally random and effects the outcome in Opencity.\u00a0 Irregardless, of progress made.</p>\n<p>However, I must give some help on clues.\u00a0 Major clues will always be in the apartment or house.\u00a0 If there not in plain site; Check the furniture by clicking on the furniture. The major clue found must match the clue card in the stores\u00a0 or\u00a0\u00a0the pawn shop.<br/></p>\n<p>CLUES ARE(MAJOR PROBLEMS):</p>\n<p>FIRE: player can put fires out as they search for clues (clues = flashing briefcase)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0COUP = player can disarm people before they rise up for a coup. In essence, preventing it.</p>\n<p>CONSOLE: must find clue(flashing briefcase) then bomb. Afterwards, finding clue card in stores or pawn shop. (hardest one)</p>\n<p>VILE: must hit people to find a vile strain. If the person is affected then the bad meter</p>\n<p>will shrink.\u00a0 If not then the player can give back the possession dropped to balance</p>\n<p>the damage.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>HIDDEN: alien invasion is occurring and aliens are hidden among the population.</p>\n<p>Without hurting the people. The player can use targeting to find the alien. If found the alien can be destroy. Saucers can be destroyed with targeting or shield. Clues are found the same way as the fire scenerio.</p>\n<p>GENETIC: People are being altered from experimenting with genetics. Pull the bad part off while searching for the clue and clue card.\u00a0</p>\n<p>RADIATION: Radiation is hidden in the furniture inside of the apartments and houses. Stores and the pawn shops as well.\u00a0 Just click the furniture or search inside</p>\n<p>the food stations of the stores.\u00a0 Radiation causes bad to happen quickly. So, finding the clue to match the clue card is important.</p>\n<p>Other problems are dealt first hand while interacting within the city.\u00a0 By pinning items at a guess will\u00a0 do good or bad.\u00a0 For instance, Blue and white board goes to the two story apartment building.\u00a0 The shopping bag goes to the store. Some items have gravity other's float.</p>\n<p>Without solving clues or cleaning up.\u00a0 Opencity will fall into a negative depression. From there it will be like a downward spiral.\u00a0 Also, the clue card can be seen if set in the option room.</p>\n<p>Hitting people or giving them weapons\u00a0 is\u00a0considered bad on the player's part. Giving is always good. .... No trash though!!!.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If a person is infected or otherwise. The player can remove the infection but no harm can come to the people.\u00a0 Protest signs can be taken only if the protest doesn't make sense. For instance, \"NO WORK\", or, \"NO\".\u00a0 Anything that normally would be deemed good. Other phenomena will have to be discovered over time.</p>\n<p>In closing, the idea of Opencity is not to win or level up. It's not to gain the most money.\u00a0\u00a0It's to see how good a person can carry themself through Opencity.\u00a0 Even if a scenario is not completed the main idea is doing good.\u00a0 For this reason I have omitted certain hints\u00a0 for discovery.\u00a0 Therefore, the player is expected to find out about Opencity\u00a0 with very little help.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:09:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d6/9d67b95b763220e7c76bf3a75010d6ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrpete"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
