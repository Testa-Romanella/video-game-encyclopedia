Your objective is to either have claim to the whole will or how much your heart desires.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Someone's Blowing Bubbles at the Funeral</em><strong>\u00a0RuleBook.pdf\u00a0</strong>(small adjustment to the Rule Book you can make is that you can change the amount of points the Will starts off with if 200 points seem overwhelming.
