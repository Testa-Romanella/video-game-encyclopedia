I spent nine months designing and coding Starship in Java. Created from the ground up, I used only Java\u2019s built in libraries (as well as a library to play mp3 files).<br/><br/>It's incomplete and unpolished, but a neat concept. Includes a terribly\u00a0confusing tutorial, and a short quest. The game is also set up to be relatively easy to mod.\u00a0</p><p>Game Design, Writing, Art, and Code by Austin Kucera: \u00a0www.AustinKucera.com</p><p>There are some great assets online for indie devs. I'm particularly thankful for Chris Adamek's support, as well as that of Stellardrone.
