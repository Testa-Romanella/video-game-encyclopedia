Enemies attack if your fire gets too big. Use your axe to chop down trees and break up logs to get more sticks and keep your fire going. Your axe will double as a weapon when enemies attack.</p>\n<p>Press 'E' to pick up sticks, press 'E' again when by the fire to deposit the sticks into the fire.</p>\n<p>Torches keep you warm, but burn out after 20 seconds and will need to be re-crafted while the axe and backpack do not need to be re-crafted.<br/></p>\n<p>Built for the VimJam3 game jam using Unreal 5 and C++. The focus of the jam was \"multi-use\" and the theme was \"turn up the heat\". Multi-use can be seen in two forms; the axe is used for chopping up logs/trees and attacking the enemies. The sticks are used for crafting 3 different items and for turning up the heat of the fire.</p><p>Credits:</p><p><strong>Art:</strong><br/>Player character, enemies, and trees are artwork from Kaykit asset packs<br/>https://kaylousberg.itch.io/</p><p>Fire is from M5 VFX Vol2.
