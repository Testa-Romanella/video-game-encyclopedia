KYRIOS has a transformation mechanism to switch between \u201cFlight Mode\u201d and \u201cMS Mode\u201d. In the game, I used the switching sprite function. When the player gets 600 points by shooting the enemies, the Fighter aircraft form will turn to the Gundam. There are four waves of enemies in total. If the player gets hit by 5 times, the game is over.</p><p>Music: Waterflame - Space Chase [Animation Score]</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqD4_dtUdDY<br/></p>\n<p>Sound: Freesound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T06:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/036/0364113a5120c5b79a2c98f7cd401412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["aaangelaZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
