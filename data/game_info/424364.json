Enter the AI drawing duration in main menu in\u00a0<strong>SECONDS</strong></p>\n<p>2. The program will run automatically and after it finishes it will store a screenshot of the finished art which you can access on<em> /ARTificial/ARTificial_Data/ARTificial *random number*.png</em></p>\n<p>3. After step number 2, the program will <strong>automatically</strong> reset the canvas and start over with the same duration and <strong>it will keep doing so until you close the program</strong>. It does this so you can input short durations without the need to reset manually everytime.</p>\n\n<p>for further questions, DM me on\u00a0INSTAGRAM</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T03:36:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/296bcb84d3c5357e29100910c9e0ca4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MIqbalKalevi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
