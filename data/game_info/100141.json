You will have to manipulate your environment to your advantage, but also maintain it to guarantee your survival and success.</p><p>Because, in space, the environment and even your own technology can turn out to be as deadly and hostile as any space pirate or parasitic xenoform.</p><p>This game's development is currently on hold due to Wave Engine having turned their Beta paradigm upside down and left me hanging with a very complex project with 300+ uncompilable errors.</p><p>However it is fully playable and fully moddable, it only has a very complicated GUI due to well, being a very complex game, and lacks some polish.</p><p>I am planning to port the entire game to Unity in the near future.
