Obviously plague times are dark and horrible, but that classic Ceefax music makes your potentially life ruining meal decision just a little better, right? <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>But what was Ceefax?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>As some background, Ceefax was a news service introduced in 1979 that was beamed to your TV through the actual TV signal. For a lot of people it was their quickest and main source of up to date news, but the service also had games, weather, whole magazines, and you could even book holidays. It sadly died in 2012 because of the digital switchover, but it remains an iconic part of British TV history.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Jam info</strong><br/></p>\n<p>TECHNICALLY, the game also does all of the wildcards, but in the vaguest way possible:\u00a0</p>\n<p>80's Baby - This one it actually does do.

Just not a part of it that media usually shows.</p>\n<p>Take a chance on me - The food that is safe from plague is randomly picked each time, and some clues are more hidden than others.</p>\n<p>I wish it would rain - There is a weather page, and that weather page has changing weather...<br/><br/></p>\n<p>See more lovely CEEFAX music on YouTube: </p>\n\n<p>\"Smooth Lovin\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Lobby Time by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3986-lobby-time<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Carefree by Kevin MacLeod<br/>Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3476-carefree<br/>License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T05:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e1/7e106d9ea2422d0efb83419c84f070b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["HeyYeh"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
