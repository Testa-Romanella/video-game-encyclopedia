Each game was cobbled together, one person at a time, with nobody knowing what they would be working on until they got it. It was an experiment in collaboration and building on the work of others. It was also an exercise in creativity, letting go of intention and surrendering to the communal flow. It was a lot of fun!<br/></p>\n<p>Fourteen people worked on the Unity track. It started out as a character and camera controller and slowly evolved into a whole ecosystem of blooming flowers,\u00a0 herbivores and carnivores competing for resources,  and fields of poop - all watched over by a looming purple giant on the horizon.</p>\n<p>You can download the game as it was after each day here.<br/></p>\n<p>Contributors:</p>\n<p>Day 1 - Rachel Sima<br/>Day 2 - Chris LaPollo<br/>Day 3 - Edward Ganges<br/>Day 4 - Michael Yeiter<br/>Day 5 - Danielle Vuono<br/>Day 6 - Jake O'Brien<br/>Day 7 - Camden Segal<br/>Day 8 - Michael Toone<br/>Day 9 - Adrian Sandoval<br/>Day 10 - Mark Black<br/>Day 11 - Alex Cole<br/>Day 12 - Jerry Aviles<br/>Day 13 - Aaron Kang<br/>Day 14 - Steve Pettit</p>\n<p>There were also Exquisite Corpse tracks in Twine, Phaser/HTML5, Analog and PuzzleScript.\u00a0 Check them out!\r\n</p>\n<p>The jam was inspired by the Exquisite Corpse parlor game, invented by the surrealists.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e79/e795c4abe110380d38730f066c160c1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["PhillyGameMechanics"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
