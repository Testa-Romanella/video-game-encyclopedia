Suspended in the middle of the environment is the central source for sustaining life in the ectopic home of the future, the true \u201cheart of the home.\u201d The external structure of the home, the skin, provides warmth and light to the organisms living within the environment. Building on the surrealist environment put forward by our previous projects, our plan is to develop an environment that forecasts the future of an Ecotopic high density housing project.</p>\n<p>For the final submission we will be using the photos/videos that we captured, combined with the audio, and motion graphics to create a video of the environment which will be uploaded to Vimeo for sharing purposes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Emily, Marquessa, Nicole, Serena<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T10:31:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31c/31c531321d27361cf8d96f6f8fd5bb1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Awesome"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
