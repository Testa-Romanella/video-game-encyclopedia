The pill with the\u00a0flag must be the last one to be collected.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>MY FIRST EVER GAME JAM!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Made in 8 days for a Game Jam held by an association at my university, it doesn't have many levels, but they're carefully made so there's always an answer that's challenging, yet fun to find. It\u00a0won't be as easy as you might expect, so good luck if you want to beat the whole thing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T07:26:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/717/717d2028e6afaa28340f848f9bab9a95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kolog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
