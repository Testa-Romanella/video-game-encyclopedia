RC-AirSim has more realistic flight dynamics and ground handling than most of the much more expensive r/c flight sims.<br/><br/>This Full Version of RC-AirSim features:<br/><br/>\u00b7 Many different model airplanes to fly including: F-15 Fighter Jet, WWI Biplane, Glider, Electric Parkflyer, Aerobatic Planes, and a Trainer.<br/>\u00b7 Realistic r/c model airplane flight aerodynamics based on NASA flight simulation technology.<br/>\u00b7 MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad) Twin-Stick Game Controller support.<br/>\u00b7 Accurate landing and ground handling simulation.<br/>\u00b7 Awesome crashes! Planes break apart in a physics-based manner.<br/>\u00b7 4 channel control: aileron, elevator, rudder, throttle.<br/>\u00b7 3 view options: R/C (Third person), Following (Chase cam), and Onboard camera (FPV)<br/>\u00b7 3 control modes: Mode 2 (default), Mode 1, and 3 Channel.<br/>\u00b7 Field objects to avoid and fly behind. <br/>\u00b7 Doppler-correct sound.<br/>\u00b7 Touch Points or On-screen Transmitter Sticks control options.<br/>\u00b7 Get flying quickly! No slow, tedious menus or multiple load screens.<br/><br/>Please Note: RC-AirSim is a realistic r/c model airplane flight simulator, NOT an arcade game. And like a real model airplane, it will take some practice to master the basics. Luckily, in RC-AirSim, plane crashes are free (and fun)!  Pro Tip: If you are a novice r/c pilot, start with the Slowmowatt in 3 Channel control mode.<br/><br/>RC-AirSim is a favorite of radio-controlled model airplane pilots worldwide because it excels where it matters most: realistic flight dynamics and aerodynamics!<br/><br/>Tired of \"simulators\" that feel unrealistic and fly like an arcade game? Try RC-AirSim! Experienced R/C pilots say that RC-AirSim feels and flies like an actual r/c model airplane! R/C pilots, don't let your skills get rusty when you are away from the flying field: practice with RC-AirSim. New to the hobby of r/c model airplanes? Learn on RC-AirSim first and make the maiden flight of your first r/c plane a successful one.<br/><br/>RC-AirSim R/C Aircraft:<br/><br/>\u00b7 F-15 Regal Eagle<br/>Large gas powered ducted fan military jet.  4 Channel control.<br/><br/>\u00b7 WWI Flying Ace<br/>Electric scale biplane based on the historic World War I Fokker D.VII. Moving control surfaces and spinning prop. Comes with two paint schemes: Red/White or Blue/Green Lozenge. 4 Channel control. <br/><br/>\u00b7 Back 40 Trainer<br/>Classic 4 channel high-wing trainer with plenty of dihedral for beginners. Powered by a .40 size gas engine.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Slowmowatt<br/>Electric park flyer. Flies very slow so there is plenty of time to react. Easiest to fly! Perfect for beginners using the 3 Channel control mode. 4 channel control available.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Double Helix<br/>Low wing electric sport plane. A great choice for beginning aerobatics. 4 Channel control.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Madster EDF<br/>Small sport scale electric ducted fan military jet. 4 Channel control.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Super Dee<br/>Large high wing tail-dragger aerobatic sport plane. Gas powered. Great for low inverted passes!  4 Channel control.<br/><br/>\u00b7 Emerald Glider<br/>Classic 2-meter wingspan glider. 4 Channels - use the 'throttle' channel to adjust your drag. For rudder/elevator controls only (no ailerons), fly using 3 Channel control mode.<br/><br/>Questions? Comments? Suggestions?
