Next time, try to roll better! Rolling hot? You\u2019ll earn Streaks! <br/> <br/>How to play: Roll four dice and select from the pairs presented to place a \u201crunner\u201d on the numbered column. Subsequent rolls either add a new runner or advance a runner that\u2019s already on the board. You only get three runners and when they are on the board, you must roll an advancing pair, fail to do so and you lose all your progress! When a player claims three columns, the game ends!<br/>You Can Look Forward to Getting Hooked On:<br/>\u2022Beautiful 3d and animations<br/>\u2022Original Music and sound effects<br/>\u2022Up to 4 players: Single Player and Pass-and-Play Multiplayer<br/>\u2022Variable levels of AI<br/>\u2022Game Center Achievements<br/>\u2022Streak Meter<br/><br/><br/>Praise for the classic board game:<br/>\u2022Spiel des Jahres: Game of the Year Nominee 1982<br/>\u2022Games Magazine: Best Family Game Nominee 2008<br/>\u2022Major FUN: Major FUN Award 2008 <br/><br/><br/>Compatible with iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPod touch (3rd generation), iPod touch (4th generation) and iPad, iPad2 and iPad3.<br/>Requires:  iOS 4.2 or later.<br/>Requires: Game Center account required for Achievements<br/>Platform: iOS Universal App <br/><br/>Also by Playdek<br/>Summoner Wars; Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer; Food Fight iOS; Nightfall; Fluxx; Penny Arcade The Game: Gamers vs Evil", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91e/91e12ccc7b8bcca751d25b88e6016750.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Playdek"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Playdek"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
