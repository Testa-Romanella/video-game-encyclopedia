It is a giant pizza cutter cutting through an infinitely large pizza in space. Welcome to the <strong><em>Pizza Cutter Earth Society!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Made during Spring Game Jam 2019, organized by\u00a0LiU Game Jam, based on the themes\u00a0<em>Very Large Pizza Cutter\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>Spinning Change</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>Turns out however that living on a giant pizza cutter is less than ideal. You see, any buildings that come in contact with the pizza cutter's handle gets destroyed, which is inevitable given that you live on the ever rotating blade of the pizza cutter.</p>\r\nResources and buildings\r\n<p>There is a simple solution however: build a pizza rocket at fly away (<em>for maximum enjoooy... Pleasure!</em>) and luckily the following building resources are constantly being extracted from the pizza, ending up on the blade:</p>\n<ul><li>Vesuvium (red)</li><li>Hawaiium (yellow)</li><li>Funghite (green)</li><li>Salamite (pink)</li></ul>\n<p>There are two more resources however that are needed on you road towards building a rocket:</p>\n<ul><li>Capriccionium (cyan)</li><li>Kebabite (magenta)</li></ul>\n<p>To get these resources, you need to build specific buildings. All buildings require some invested resources just to build them before they can be fed with resources that are converted to\u00a0Capriccionium or Kebabite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This means that you should save up resources in bulk before you invest them into buildings. Otherwise you risk having the buildings getting destroyed against the pizza cutter handle before you have converted enough resources, effectively wasting the investment cost of getting the buildings built.</p>\n<p>To set up a build\u00a0plot, enter build mode by pressing [B] and select a fitting build position.</p>\r\nInhabitants and actions\r\n<p>To your help you have four\u00a0inhabitants willing to collect resources for your building projects for you. They can\u00a0perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul><li>Break up resource block (releases a lot of resources for collection)</li><li>Collect resources</li><li>Drop off resources at build plot or building</li><li>Walk to position</li></ul>\n<p>It is\u00a0worth noting is that an\u00a0inhabitant can only carry resources of one type at the time.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Move camera</strong> | W, A, S, D<br/><strong>Select inhabitant/build plot</strong> | Left mouse click<br/><strong>Perform action with select inhabitant</strong> |\u00a0Left mouse click\u00a0<br/><strong>Drop selected inhabitant's resources</strong> | F<br/><strong>Toggle build/selection mode</strong>\u00a0| B</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<strong>Axel Nordanskog</strong>programming, 3D modelling (pizza and pizza cutter)\u00a0and animation<strong>Daniel Carlsson</strong>programming, 3D modelling (buildings) and animation<strong>Erik Mans\u00e9n</strong>programming<strong>Jakob Lars Norell</strong>music<strong>Joel Johnsson</strong>programming", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:10:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57e/57ec3364e550dd80d1f4ac8cdf3f7125.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Axerosh", "jemapelle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
