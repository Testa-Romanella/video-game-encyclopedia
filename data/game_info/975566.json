In the game, different shaped blocks composed of small blocks gradually fall from the top of the screen. <br/>\r\nPlayers can adjust the position and direction of the blocks to make them complete one or several pieces at the bottom of the screen. These complete horizontal bars will immediately disappear, making room for newly fallen blocks, and at the same time, players will receive score rewards. The blocks that have not been eliminated continue to pile up. <br/>\r\nOnce they reach the top of the screen, the player loses and the game ends. The screen is colorful and well crafted.
