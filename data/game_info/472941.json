It was made for \u201cMy First Game Jam\u201d, in roughly two weeks (real life got in the way, so count around 9 to 10 days of actual design and development, more 1 day and a half for trailer, screenshots and the neat design document you can download if you like). The game if free, and will always be (at least this version), but you can support me and buy me a coffee if you want.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Obs: There are still some bugs in the game. If you get stuck somewhere, please press R (Y on the gamepad, or the equivalent) to restart the room.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for downloading and playing this game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>I really hope you enjoy it.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-27T04:20:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba80dbf806aa00503c7974eddcc4fc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GKorn"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
