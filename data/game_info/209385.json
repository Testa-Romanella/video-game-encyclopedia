Take control of Shamus, a pixel boy created in a few hours on a Monday night. A heroic boy who is impervious to lava for some reason? Guide him through this EPIC QUEST avoiding spikes, jumping on lava blobs in a way that is totally original and not a Mario rip off. LAVA PLATFORM: THE INDIE GAME\u2122 incorporates some of the latest technology like MOVING platforms. This INTENSE JOURNEY spans over two PERILOUS levels and a shoehorned boss level that is just a bigger version of the smaller enemies because we had to fire our art department. Enjoy our BEAUTIFUL sound track that is completely original and belongs to me and only me(/s). All tracks made on garbage band on a Pear\u2122 .
