Search for signals and learn to pick random extraterrestrial broadcasts from the regular patterns of other astronomical objects. Zoom into a fractal galaxy and explore! Start your own Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence!</p>\n<p>As you search the sky, you will hear noise and see pixels at the bottom of the screen. This means you have found a signal! Zoom in and try and find it again. Signals with regular patterns are not alien civilizations - these are random.</p>\n<p>When you start the game, it must generate the galaxy and 300,000 signals! This usually takes about 5 seconds, so please be patient.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Zoom in: space, enter, left click.</li><li>Zoom out: backspace, right click, alt-left click.</li><li>Move cursor: mouse, WASD, arrow keys.</li></ul><ul>Thanks for playing!
