To survive you need to defeat monsters for xp, roll around to get weapons, upgrade your gear and don't let the monsters overwhelm you. Longer the game goes more difficult it gets. Early stage of something insane, probably.</p><p>When you kill an enemy it spawns an orange experience point on the map. Pick them up to level up your character to upgrade weapons. You are against time. Can you make it to the 5 minute mark?</p>\n<p>Made in Finnish Game jam 2022! Inspired by Vampire Survivors. Made with crayons, paper, scanner and Unity. Mobile-friendly with auto-shooting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T08:45:29", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["iFeral"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
