In my interpretation the player character exists as two cubes and with the press of a button, the player splits into two, leaving one part behind. This can be used strategically to either reach far away places or it can be used to place the second part to activate floor switches. Since the parts are connected, pressing the button again will bring the two pieces back together.<br/></p>\n<p>It was my first game jam, and I learned alot along the way. Looking forward to the next! :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>'A' and\u00a0'D' moves the player horizontally<br/>'Spacebar' can be used to jump, double jump or\u00a0wall jum<br/>'Left Shift\" will split the character\u00a0(press again to combine the character)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f7/2f7121fccb3c8f88226ceed79587142a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pineapple_z"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
