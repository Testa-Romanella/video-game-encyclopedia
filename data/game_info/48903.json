This is crafted as introductory experience into VR, demonstrating power of this technology to create familiar worlds and settings as well as realities that behave unlike anything that you might know.<br/><br/>Additionally the original <strong>SightLine 2013 VR Jam experience</strong> for DK1 has been remastered and updated with latest OpenVR SDK, making it playable with modern VR headsets. This version offers a narrative and based experience with action and puzzle solving built around the same core mechanic.<br/><br/><br/>Both demos are <strong>available for free</strong> on the main website as they have been for the past few years, but your purchase on Steam helps support the developers and help them continue focusing on developing virtual reality applications.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0661ce0447ac0ca67571a0a8933c39.jpg", "website": "http://sightlinevr.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 115, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 296, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Frooxius"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Solirax"], "esrb_rating": null}
