SPACE bar to jump. LEFT MOUSE to use ability. LEFT SHIFT to switch members.</p><p>*Currently there is a weird bug that if you play with a Xbox controller your character will automatically move and cannot stop. I think that may be the problem of unity input axis for different controllers. I don't have a Xbox controller now so I cannot fix it in a short time. If you find other bugs please inform me!
