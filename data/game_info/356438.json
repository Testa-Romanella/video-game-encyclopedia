{"id": 356438, "slug": "who-dies-first", "name": "Who Dies First", "name_original": "Who Dies First", "description": "The art assets of this game comes from the official assets \"Dragon Crashers\" of assetstore of Unity company.Unity's attitude towards using this official asset to make games is that \"All of the content in this demo can be added into your own creative projects\".And I had emailed them to confirm that.Then I would like to use this free asset. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe reason why it has such a name \"Who dies first\" is that the ending is related to which role dies first. There are multiple roles, so there will be multiple endings accordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt's a 2d Rpg game.When you finish one battle ,you will get an ending .there will be dozens of endings.And some endings don't need you to fight.It's just cutscene and story.But this pure cutscene battle is very rare.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this game ,what do you need to do is to control three roles to fight with dragon.You can use skills by clicking the role's portrait when they are light.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhich one dies first ? Wolf ? Knight? Countess ? or Drangon? The results are all different.There will be dozens of endings waiting for players to explore . <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut there are only 3 endings in Demo version . <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome endings are funy and some endings are sad . I hope you enjoy it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T03:28:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a56f9c4a2f256312542c2a9bd4bf95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["STUPID GAME", "AmyBeryl"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AmyBeryl"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
