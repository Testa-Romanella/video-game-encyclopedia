{"id": 768851, "slug": "abandoned-itch-mahdis", "name": "Abandoned (itch) (Mahdis)", "name_original": "Abandoned (itch) (Mahdis)", "description": "<p><strong>Genre</strong>: First Person, Horror, Puzzle\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Benchmarks</strong>: P.T, Outlast, Alien Isolation, Resident Evil\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong>: Hospital Horror Pack, Top-Down Graveyard</p>\n<p>The players find themselves in an abandoned hospital. They realize this, by exploring the\u00a0area around them and interacting with the objects surrounding them. The focus of this game\u00a0is on the atmosphere and audio. With the ambient music playing in the background, the heartbeat, and\u00a0breathing sounds, a spooky and mysterious environment is created. The goal of the game is\u00a0to solve the puzzles such as find the keys in each level and abandon the hospital.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong></p>\n<p>In game use \"1\" for flashlight and \"2\" for Geiger counter. \"Shift\" to run and \"spacebar\" to jump. \"F\" to turn the flashlight on and off.</p>\n<p><em>Ambience:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Aside from the background music, the players can hear their own footsteps. The aim is to\u00a0make the players feel abandoned and alone in this hospital. Interaction with some objects\u00a0serve the purpose of solving the puzzles. Unique layers of sound have been added for each\u00a0interaction. As an example, by getting close to a radio, the players can hear the sound of old\u00a0radio tuning and the further away the players are this sound vanishes.</p>\n<p><em>Player Feedback:</em>\n</p>\n<p>As mentioned before, the players have to solve either one up to three puzzles in each level\u00a0in order to be able to proceed in the game. Once the puzzles are solved, aside from the\u00a0visual feedback, the players also receive audio feedback for the completed puzzles. The\u00a0audio feedback is synced with the type of puzzles that are solved, such as picking up a key,\u00a0hearing Morse code, switching the light on or off.</p>\n<p><em>Items/Enemies:</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Players have two important items in his inventory, namely a flashlight with a simple\u00a0on/off clicking and a ghost detector. The ghost detector adds a substantial atmosphere next\u00a0to our Music. It extends the tension of the players with its constant clicking noise of a\u00a0Geiger-counter but getting closer to our threats makes the noise louder, puts the pitch\u00a0higher, and lets them hear the breathing of their nearby threat, as well as their own\u00a0heartbeat.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Music\u00a0Style:</em>\n</p>\n<p>We use a slow orchestral score with ambient elements with the goal to create a thick\u00a0atmosphere. The players should feel uneasy and intimated. Instrumentation consists of\u00a0evolving drone sounds to fill out the lows and strings at the highs with an eerie solo violin\u00a0playing the lead melody. Our main theme implements the concept of buildup and release\u00a0with constant automation on parameters like volume and filters to keep tension high and\u00a0make the piece feel alive. Both the violins and strings are playing slightly out of tune to make\u00a0the listener feel uncomfortable - exactly how we want our players to feel as they make their\u00a0way through the hospital.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Musical references:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Our sound is inspired from orchestral game soundtracks like \u201cOutlast\u201d and \u201cAlien: Isolation\u201d\u00a0with their creepy strings and classical instrumentation, while also using elements from less\u00a0instrumental horror movie scores like \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d. In particular the evolving drone\u00a0sounds are a stylistic device often used in horror media of all kinds.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Recording:</em></p>\n<p>Our main theme was produced and recorded digitally with plugins like Omnisphere and\u00a0Xpand! in the DAW Ableton 11.</p>\n<p><em>Implementation:</em></p>\n<p>We have one main theme, that is composed in such a way that it can be looped seamlessly\u00a0without the listener noticing the transition. Through all our levels we use the same track,\u00a0continuing through loading times and pause screens, with the intention to never break\u00a0immersion and keep the player engaged.</p>\n<p>This game was created as part of a university project by:\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Mahdis Sabzevarzadeh\u00a0</p>\n<p>Samuel Saruba</p>\n<p>Dominik Urban</p>\n<p>Puxuan Wang<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T09:30:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/058/0582968fce9299daf6e476e33030a2a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mahdis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
