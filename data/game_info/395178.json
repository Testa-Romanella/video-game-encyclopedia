{"id": 395178, "slug": "marvels-spider-man-silver-lining", "name": "Marvel's Spider-Man - Silver Lining", "name_original": "Marvel's Spider-Man - Silver Lining", "description": "<p>With Sable International&#39;s advanced equipment and weaponry, Hammerhead&#39;s gang rules over the city. Silver Sablinova, head of Sable International, returns to take revenge on Hammerhead for stealing her supplies. Spider-Man, worried that Sablinova&#39;s violent methods would result in more chaos, tries to convince her to work together with him. Hammerhead, who has now upgraded himself into an advanced cyborg exoskeleton, leads Spider-Man and Sablinova into a trap and overpowers both of them. Felicia, who is revealed to be alive, saves Spider-Man from being killed, though Sablinova is captured by Hammerhead. Felicia gives Spider-Man a USB drive containing information on Hammerhead before disappearing again. Spider-Man rescues Sablinova and they learn that the carbon steel plate inside Hammerhead&#39;s head is sensitive to heat. Sablinova takes Spider-Man to her stealth carrier on the Hudson River to bait Hammerhead into following them there. They work together to outfit Sablinova&#39;s VTOL fighter jet with a heated laser array; finishing just as Hammerhead attacks them. Spider-Man holds Hammerhead in place while Sablinova continues to blast the metal plate. Eventually, Hammerhead is weakened, and Sablinova crashes her jet into him, defeating him. With her business finished, Sablinova plans to return to her home country of Symkaria to deal with the civil war there. MJ informs Peter that she plans to go to Symkaria to cover the story on the civil war and raise awareness. In the aftermath, Peter begins to train Miles Morales on how to use his newly acquired abilities, starting with web-swinging, which he eventually puts to good use.</p>", "metacritic": 75, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T21:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/68b/68bff612bba3a74dfeb4cf4cc1c59a9e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.68, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 11, "beaten": 78, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 5, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 69, "suggestions_count": 350, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 69, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Insomniac Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
