It's a puzzle exploration game about a fox in a winter forest. You take control of other animals and use their abilities to collect crystals and use them to activate a mysterious statue.</p><p>\n<strong>WHY WE MADE IT</strong><br/>\r\n\t This game was made for Ludum Dare 29, and the theme was Beneath the Surface. This was our first attempt at creating something with a compelling atmosphere with graphics and audio working together, and we were really pleased with the result. The link to the theme was a sinister statue beneath the surface of the forest, that slowly rose from the ground as you discovered more crystals.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>CONTROLS &amp; HELP</strong><br/>\r\n\t Click the left mouse button on the map where you want to move. Left-click on an animal to take control of them, and left-click back on the fox to return. Some animals have a 'special ability' which is activated with the right mouse button.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tEach level has an owl which you can take control of. Owls can see things which other animals can't, including forest spirits, which may say useful things or help with puzzles.  The controls are a bit tricky at times, but stick with it, you can complete everything</p>\n<strong>EDGE</strong>\n<strong>JAMES</strong>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\tGameplay,<br/>\r\n\t\tSound &amp; Music\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tArt, Design<br/>\r\n\t\t &amp; Animation", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/870/870ad024179f00bb11aa785d542657f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Second Dimension Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
