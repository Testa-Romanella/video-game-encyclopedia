It was originally written in late 2017, early 2018 as both an experiment with Twine and also as a study project requirement.</p>\n<p>Now, I put it here as a gift to those who have supported me and my development of my main interactive fiction project- Model Citizens: Unmasked. The support and patience that I have received is something I hold so very very dearly. I started writing Model Citizens because it was fun to me, and I put it out into the world because I figured others might have fun with it as well. Never did I ever expect the outpouring of such gracious love and kindness that I have received, and I can never overstress enough how grateful I am for such.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thank you all for everything you have done. I hope you all have lovely, amazing days.</p>\n<p><strong>A BRIEF BUT TOPICAL CONTENT WARNING:</strong></p>\n<p>Contains themes and direct mentions and descriptions\u00a0of isolation and illness.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T03:32:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/940/940698342941672f7ed747bf9c09b54f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["renab"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
