She was already being targeted by the slender man. Whether in a dream or in reality, she can always see a figure of a faceless man with long and thin arms wandering around. Until one day, Kylie was kidnapped by the slender man and taken to the haunted city that appears frequently in the little girl's dreams. In order to escape from the Slender Man, the little girl must avoid the Slender Man's sight and find her way home. Help the little girl escape and get back to reality.\r\n</p>\n<p>Slender Mirror World (Part I) is out of my personal hobby for game development.\u00a0 Currently, the game has not been completed, and there will be follow-ups in the future.
