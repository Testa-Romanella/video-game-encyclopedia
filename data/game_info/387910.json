It's my very first game and I wanted to learn as much as possible on this project, so it is very much a full-sized game with many areas, game modes, extras, unlockables, cameos and crossovers!</p>\n<p>Boofie's Bunker is a survival horror game about escaping a bunker that the protagonist was mysteriously transported to. The story is non-linear and is told through memories. Memories are unlocked after winning each difficulty of each level. More levels are unlocked by further investigating sounds or out-of-the-ordinary things inside the bunker. The game varies in difficulty, but gets very difficult in the end. Perseverance is definitely rewarding. You're in for a treat if you finish all difficulties of each level.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>WASD = Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse\u00a0 = Look Around</p>\n<p>LMB = Interact</p>\n<p>RMB = Drop Items / Secondary Interact</p>\n<p>Q = Lean Left</p>\n<p>E = Lean Right</p>\n<p>Space Bar = Look Over Shoulder</p>\n<p>TIPS</p>\n<p>-If you see a radio, interact with it to listen to it.</p>\n<p>-If you're confused about how an enemy works, the totems in each menu can help!</p>\n<p>-If you want to reset your saved data, the droid in the main menu can do that for you.</p>\n<p>-As a matter of fact, interact with everything. You never know what will happen!</p>\n<p>Also, make sure you keep an eye and ear out EVERYWHERE for secrets. This is a very big game, but most of the game is hidden beneath the surface of the Bunker itself. Unlock new areas by finding them in-game to progress in the story! Be a completionist, there's something awesome waiting after you complete every mode and difficulty!</p>\n<p>HUGE thanks to Dave Microwaves Games and Padre Snowmizzle for playtesting this game as much as they did. It definitely wouldn't have become what it has today without their wonderful feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:40:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/35d/35d32ff429ca106e96e9638a5c70e336.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroHorrorArcade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
