We can collect the coins by clicking on them, which gives us points. There are two enemies who also try to collect the coins. The coins collected by the enemies won't regenerate so if all the coins are taken by the enemies then no more coins will fall from the spawners. You can increase the number of coins falling from the spawners by upgrading them which costs you 4 coins.<br/></p>\n<p>4.
