WASD to move, Dodge red shots, Shoot Enemies with Left Click. They each have 3 health. If they hit you, you have a yellow block that appears in the middle of the floor indicating you are invincible for a short period of time.</p>\n<p>How I incorporated the theme? I didn't finish it so I couldn't really add the fact that it was supposed to be a rogue-like game where you have 1 life to complete multiple stages.\u00a0 I will be updating this game for future and hoping to make it at least playable soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-11T03:41:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/398/3986195271b0e9b9944000f7d873816a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eshego"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
