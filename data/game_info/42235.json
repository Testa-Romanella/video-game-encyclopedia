You can create your games using in-game assets and mechanics as well as play pre-made or player-made games. You can share your games with other players. There is a rating system for games. The best-rated ones would be featured in the special section of the main menu. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The creation system offers a wide variety of tools. Upon creating a new world, you can choose your project\u2019s genre and setting.<br />\nYou can transform the world\u2019s terrain, apply different textures on objects, change its properties. The object can be chosen from the extensive catalog of presets or be created with in-game tools. The chief mechanic of Project Spark is the so-called \u201cbrain system\u201d that allows you to make algorithms and chose the conditions for characters\u2019 and objects\u2019 actions. It has the form of \u2018when X that do Y\u2019 sequences. For example, you can make an algorithm for your character like \u2018when PRESS A make STRONG ATTACK.\u2019 The sequences, however, can be much more complicated and you can program many of them for each object. The pre-made adventures mostly serve as tutorials introducing the player to the in-game systems and mechanics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-29T23:31:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1f/a1f1071455936680a4a6595784223c61.jpg", "website": "http://joinprojectspark.com", "rating": 2.43, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 8, "owned": 320, "beaten": 3, "dropped": 21, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 239, "ratings_count": 37, "suggestions_count": 543, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 37, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Microsoft Game Studios", "Team Dakota"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
