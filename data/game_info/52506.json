{"id": 52506, "slug": "custers-revenge", "name": "Custer's Revenge", "name_original": "Custer's Revenge", "description": "<p>Custer's Revenge (also known as Westward Ho) is an adult video game produced by Mystique for the Atari 2600. First released on September 23, 1982.</p>\n<p>The titular player character is based on famous American Civil War commander General George Armstrong Custer, who is most well known for his major defeat at the Battle of Little Bighorn.</p>\n<p>Following the North American video game crash of 1983, Mystique was unable to stay in business. As a result, many of Mystique's intellectual properties, including Custer's Revenge, were sold off to the adult video game company Playaround. Under the ownership of Playaround, Custer's Revenge was re-branded as Westward Ho and given slight modifications to its original game-play. These alterations included simple aesthetic changes such as the darkening in color of the Native American woman's skin tone. Playaround also made a version of Custer's Revenge named General Retreat.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1982-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e1/5e1e605067767d85c0dd47d962111f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Mystique"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Mystique"], "esrb_rating": null}
