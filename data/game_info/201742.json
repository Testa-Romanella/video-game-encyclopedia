The concept is simple: guide the dots to their destination in the maze by clicking the switches. Do this before time runs out or you'll have to start all over again.</p><p>For now, Logis is only available on IOS, but it will be released to other platforms soon. Logis is free and does not contain any ads. A Level Pack is available as IAP for 0.99, but the free version contains enough levels to keep you occupied for a good while ;-) </p><p>I am putting this game here on Itch.io to get some feedback from you. Is the game too hard, too easy, boring, does it just suck? Let me know! Have a suggestion for a level? Drop it in the comments below! Like it? Please share it!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ed/0edc47f5861f52ac060662af7ee572be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Logisgame"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
