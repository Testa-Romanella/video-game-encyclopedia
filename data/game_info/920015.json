Although the Ai and light source don't trigger a massive alert. The idea has still been replicated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The limitation of this jam, was \"everything is tied to the rhythm\". With the idea of the TV screens they will flash continuously throughout play giving the player the much needed light to navigate through the level. Additionally we implemented a heart rate system, here the player's heart rate will increase over time, when it reaches certain levels, the TV's will also flash faster and so will the music. There is a lot more we would of liked to achieve. But I'm happy with the result. -Harry-James Linford.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you suffer from epilepsy we would advise you to not play this game or take necessary risks when playing.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>\n<p>Static is lost at sea, around them are the horrors of other units like them self, strung up and left to rot. The other units still have some power and will attempt to light the way for static to reach their home. The search light will increase Static's heart rate, the TV's will also flicker in time with the heart rate. Watch out for the creatures of the deep, is this how the others met their end?</p>\n<p><strong>Can be played with keyboard or controller:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Movement:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard - WASD</li><li>Gamepad - Leftstick</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Game/Level Designer/blueprinter -\u00a0Harry-James Linford</li><li>Art - Laura Minns</li><li>VFX - Keenan Smith</li><li>Audio - Angus Macnaughton</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0 (Thank you to all our friends, who supported us)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T07:21:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1f/d1f3ced0e7713e407270d05e82a146ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 178, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Harry-James Linford"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
