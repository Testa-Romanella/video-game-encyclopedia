Some years ago I made a very similar game using a youtube tutorial, but I was only copying all I was seeing on the video, so I really didn't learn anything. However, I have just finished a beginner's unity online course, so I decided to do a remake of that game with the knowlege that I just gained. This is the background story of this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay info:</strong> You gain points by getting stars. There are five different stars, from five pointed to nine pointed, and their values\u00a0go from 20 to 100 with a difference of 20 between them. The highscore and the volumes of the music and the sounds are saved when you exit the game. Thanks for playing and enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:29:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b0/9b00031b0f60e62d024493b17e60d050.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["aMaze13"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
