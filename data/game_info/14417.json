You play a man on his last night alive as he obsesses over a mysterious painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Takes ten minutes to play and has \"next-gen\" features like a shrimp tank with pet shrimp. <strong>Be warned, the game contains explicit handling of suicide.</strong><br/><br/>For people that have played the game elsewhere, this is the original version, not an expansion or HD remake. <br/><br/>Follow me on twitter at @jessebarksdale.
