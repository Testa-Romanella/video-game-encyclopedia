The pay gate is set in order to garner investment from serious backers\u00a0who want to see the game fleshed out as it's worked on.\u00a0 Since this build is alpha/pre-release, the intent will be to potentially release it as a free with donation suggestion in the future, but for now I want the content to be driven by people serious about wanting to see it developed. I'm doing this is my free time and am hoping during the development, backers will help keep the lights on while this gets developed.\u00a0 Thanks in advance to all backers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-22T06:11:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce8/ce8d854eb4c20532d9aeedea23d41f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["utcanisacorio"], "genres": ["RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
