The game is considered to be the spiritual successor of BioWare\u2019s classic fantasy RPG titles like Baldur\u2019s Gate and Neverwinter Nights. Developers describe the game&#39;s setting as a mix of high fantasy and low fantasy. The storyline is centered around the event known as Blight, which occurs once in several hundred years and marks the demonic invasion in the world of Thedas.  <br />\nThe player creates its character by choosing its appearance, class, and race. There are 3 and three races in Dragon Age. The classes are the warrior, mage, rouge, and races are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines the character\u2019s background story and the beginning of the game. <br />\nThe interaction between the player, his teammates and NPC\u2019s is an integral part of the game. The game\u2019s storyline often makes the player take moral decisions which affect his later interaction with characters and the game world in general.</p>", "metacritic": 91, "released": "2009-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T14:08:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/dc0/dc0926d3f84ffbcc00968fe8a6f0aed3.jpg", "website": "http://dragonage.bioware.com/dao/game/order-ultimate/", "rating": 4.39, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 336, "owned": 3823, "beaten": 1622, "toplay": 232, "dropped": 530, "playing": 78}, "playtime": 7, "achievements_count": 205, "ratings_count": 1874, "suggestions_count": 647, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 1881, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PlayStation 3", "PC"], "developers": ["BioWare", "Edge of Reality"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
