It involved moment of the player using WASD. There is also two types of camera movement involved in this game. One is strictly in the same position relative to the player, and the other is more similar to a 3rd person shooter where it takes the input of the mouse to revolve its point of view. The levels were inspired by similar games that I've played previously with\u00a0 rotating obstacles as well as seesaws. Hope this is fun and challenging.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T16:18:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ad9/ad9555100557dd391be21ab1bd1eb291.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["hydrofuelcell"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
