Your weapon and ability wheels rotate as you move, changing your loadout with every step. Will you take out the zombies with a shotgun, sniper rifle, or machine gun? The wheel decides. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Zombie Revolution also has a number of abilities from doubling your fire-rate to draining the zombies' health to 1 hp. You must be careful though, as the zombies get to add an ability of THEIR choosing to your wheel when you get hit. When your ability wheel lands on one of theirs, <strong>get ready to fight for your life</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>left click to shoot (you must be standing still to shoot)</li><li>right button to aim</li><li>WASD to move / roll</li><li>shift for a speed boost</li></ul>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Kenney Jam 2021!
