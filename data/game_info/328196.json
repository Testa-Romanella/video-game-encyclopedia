It can only be played with these 6 weird cuckoo clocks we made.</p>\n\n<p>https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/335249/AltCtrlGDC_Showcase_KOOKOO.php</p>\n<p>In KOO-KOO you control a flock of mechanical birds with the mechanism of a cuckoo clock. The birds all move in their own tempo, which encourages the player to jump from clock to clock to give new commands. The interaction contains visceral pulling on weights and finely setting the hands of the clock. The gears inside the mechanism resist pulling and rattle along with the movement of the birds. All in all this creates a frantic multiplayer game where you are never really in control.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T03:09:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/617/617c5d13d47b245b3c8c2d7490af52c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oprel"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
