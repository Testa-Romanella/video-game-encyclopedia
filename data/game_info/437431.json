The goal for Al was to have\u00a0exceptional atmosphere within the game where every element feels alive and interactive. The game mechanics are simple, centered on exploration while including\u00a0concepts and ideas around A.I. like creativity, learning and adaptation.</p>\n<p>An A.I. powered robot \u00a0is sent\u00a0to explore the deepest parts of the ocean. Because of limiting factors in today\u2019s world, deep ocean exploration is not very common and is not the easiest. We do have robots being equipped with partial A.I., with an example being Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, but none that are sentient. With this game I wanted to show a possible future where robots can be taught creativity. The player will help teach the A.I. how to creatively adapt to its surroundings and get it closer to sentience with every minute played. I hope to encourage the viewer or player to question the possibility of sentient A.I. and the ethics surrounding that possibility.<br/></p>\n\n<p>...lets see who can find the alternate/secret ending!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T03:45:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be68e5f8c74eeb9b209d4c29f27f695.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Dmitriy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
