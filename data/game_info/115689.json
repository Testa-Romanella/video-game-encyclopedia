This was a 2-month project that I worked on for a class at Northeastern University. The project is currently on hold right now, as my partner and I coordinate on where we wish to take this game idea. What we aim to do is to find a fun way to bring AcrobaticFPS games (i.e. Portal) and ArenaFPS games (i.e. Quake) together for fun multiplayer (and maybe singleplayer) action.</p>\n<p>Check out www.hyperionlabs.net\u00a0for any updates or details on Project Slipgate or our team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53e/53e2e268e49d72afd900de63ff3e150a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
