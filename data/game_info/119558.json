Currently, the game only has 10 levels and can be beaten in a few minutes. If the game is well received, in the future I'll consider remaking/updating it into a bigger, full length game.</p>\n<p>Until then, download, play, and enjoy! I've poured weeks of effort into this one, and to date it's my most polished, well-crafted game yet. Of course, whether it's good or not is for you to judge.</p>\n<p>As usual, feel free to comment any critiques, bugs, or just general feedback! I really appreciate it, and it helps my make my games better.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy.....<strong> LAB REPORT!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1a/b1a1a8da0e04c14c35434fa2dcc44443.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sciman101"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
