Step into Looking Glass, a PC horror VR game set in the darkness of a hedge labyrinth. Peer through the blackness\u2014and keep tabs on the strange figures surrounding you\u2014using nothing but a hand mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere\u2019s no map. No walkthrough. And no two mazes are the same. Looking Glass takes cues from the golden era of mouse-and-keyboard horror\u2014but it's built for virtual reality. Discover strange landmarks, vaulted passages, and a landscape both suspenseful and serene. Grab your Index, Rift, or Vive and try one of the best VR horror games on Steam.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T04:40:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4f/e4fdbe4c2a4d30199005a02f5211ad05.jpg", "website": "https://wakeless.studio/lookingglass", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wakeless Studio"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Wakeless Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
