The theme of the game jam was \"Can't go back\". Our team chose to interpret this prompt with an added comma - \"Can't, go back!\" With this new idea, we created a line-cutting game in <strong>Unity 3D</strong> which the player must successfully cut in front of a whole line of people without getting called out<strong>.\u00a0</strong>Source code available at: https://github.com/vaquierm/GameJam2020.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Instructions</strong></p>\n<p>Objective: Cut into the line without alerting people beyond suspicion.
