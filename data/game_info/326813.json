It involves a soldier with a rocket launcher who is waiting to be airlifted out of the zombie apocalypse in a graveyard. Throughout the game crates of rocket ammunition are airdroped near you, and you can use your rockets to kill, but also escape the zombies. This game was made entirely in the Multimedia Fusion 2 software by Clickteam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f00ea8902fd5f72f5860371af6a45e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ethan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
