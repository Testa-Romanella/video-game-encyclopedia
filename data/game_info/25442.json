{"id": 25442, "slug": "bases-loaded", "name": "Bases Loaded", "name_original": "Bases Loaded", "description": "<p>\n      Bases Loaded is a baseball game with an arcade feel and plenty of \n      options from which players can choose. Select one of twelve teams, set \n      your lineup from the 30 players available (each with different \n      strengths), and then play a single game or try to win the pennant. \n      During game play, the screen shows two different viewpoints: one from \n      behind home plate as you\u2019re batting, and the other from the pitching \n      mound in a television-style shot (unique for the time) as your team \n      plays in the field. Strong play control and excellent graphics add to \n      the excitement as you decide what pitch to throw (you can even try to \n      provoke the opposing batter into charging the mound!), control all of \n      the positions in the field, or do your best to get a hit. So step to the \n      plate and find out why this is one of the most popular baseball games on \n      the NES. Can you pull through in the clutch?\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
