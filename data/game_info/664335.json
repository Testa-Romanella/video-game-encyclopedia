Only Day 1 is playable, and dialogue/events are subject to change in the future.\r\n\n<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER: I do not own Epic 7 or any of the Epic 7 characters portrayed here. This was made solely as a high-quality joke, and I do not intend to make any profits off of this. This is essentially an elaborate fanfiction.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Anyway, with that said,\u00a0I present to you all the stupidest, yet highest quality shitpost idea I've ever created that only appeals to\u00a0me. Everyone is bi in this game\u00a0and none of them can deal with the self-insert main character's thirsty simping self. Features 8 endings!</p>\n<p>Follow @wrongMLKhawazu on Twitter for weekly updates on the game's progress!</p>\n<p><strong>Note there might be very minor graphical bugs in this demo. Don't be afraid to report any to me if you find any.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is played solely with the mouse and the Escape button. Escape button is used to pull up the menu to Save or End Game, mouse is used for quite literally everything else.</p>\n<ul><li>The game is played by clicking on choices in interaction and dialogue, like a regular visual novel.</li><li>Occasionally, you might see dialogue choices with a \"(\u0394)\" next to it, which means that choice is considered a\u00a0<em>Chance Choice</em>. Chance Choices are randomized - the outcome could swing in one direction or the other - a direction that gains Fondness or loses it.\u00a0</li><li>A yellow\u00a0\u0394 means that there's a 50/50 chance of either outcome occurring. A green\u00a0\u0394 means that the odds for gaining Fondness are stacked in your favor (above 50%), and a red \u0394 means that the odds for gaining Fondness are stacked against your favor (below 50%).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>The Story\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You are an Epic 7 player with no ambition in life, when suddenly all of those generic anime becomes your life - you fall into the amazing and fantastical world of Orbis; the setting that Epic 7 takes place in! There are just three catches, though.\u00a0</p>\n<ol><li>You've fallen into the story-line where the playable characters of Cidonia are just a little more corrupted.</li><li>You've fallen into the tyrannical Khawazu's half of Meldrec, instead of his little sister Khawana's half.\u00a0</li><li>You've fallen hopelessly, madly,\u00a0<em>impossibly</em> in love with him, and he doesn't feel the same way.</li></ol>\n<p>On top of all that, it seems that Goddess Diche herself is the reason why you're in this\u00a0<em>isekai</em> dating sim; she's brought you here in hopes that you could help quell the possibility of an all-out war that'll break out in Cidonia because of Khawazu - but you've got plans to win him over with romance in 10 days!\u00a0Can you calm the raging inferno that burns bright within Khawazu's heart, or will you just creep him out by begging him to step on you? It's all up to you!</p>\n<p>Get ready for the hottest romance in all of Meldrec - literally!</p>\n<p><em>Semi-Important Note: This demo was released on\u00a0<strong>9/12/21</strong>.
