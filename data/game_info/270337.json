This is version 1.6.4 of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Historic Remark</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I created LambdaRogue  between 2006 and 2012 and originally released it on the former Google Code website. This is a re-release of my game, currently identical to the 1.6.4 version that was available on Google Code. You may want to read the included changelog.txt just out of curiosity on how the game evolved over the years.<br/></p>\n<p>The Linux binary in the itch.io download was re-compiled in 2018 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (see install instructions for Linux version).<br/></p>\n<p>If there is enough interest, I may continue work on the game, but if not, itch.io is at least a proper place for archiving this game, on which I worked for many years.</p>\n<p><strong>Tipps for New Players</strong></p>\n<p>LambdaRogue is a very \"classic\" roguelike insofar it has simple pixel-art (and you can even run it in a true text console mode, by changing the related option), and is controlled via the keyboard.</p>\n<p>I suggest to use \"quickstart\" in the main menu and then use \"coffeebreak mode\", to get into the game, to skip any story events and textual interruptions.</p><p>When the game has started, open the help pages by pressing \"?\" on your keyboard. Then at least read about the game's goal and have a look at the keybindings (which you can reconfigure).</p><p>Later, you may also want to try \"story mode\".<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29e789509bd32af533b635e10ae05303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 236, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mario Donick"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
