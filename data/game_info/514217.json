Unfairly easy #1 is the exact opposite of unfairly hard, where it'll reveal as many letters as possible. Unfairly easy #2 tries to reveal at least one letter if it can and keep the available word count as high as possible. Regular difficulty is just a, well, regular game of hangman.</p>\n<p>All assets were made by me except the pumpkin icon and the forest background which came from wpclipart.com .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:35:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d56/d56d0f32f3df75aa9da3e33eef2e15ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LightningA"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
