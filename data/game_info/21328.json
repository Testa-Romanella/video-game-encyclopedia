Establish trade guilds to earn gold, make equipment to strengthen your guild members, and ultimately you have to be ready for the onslaught of the Necro Lord.AboutThis is a game I\u2019ve wanted to play, but since no one else made it, I had to. I\u2019m the dev, GTGD, and I\u2019m better known for my tutorial series GTGD S1 and GTGD S2, which are here on Steam. I take great care in my work and I\u2019ve made sure that Guild Commander is a decent game.Thank you for taking the time to look at Guild Commander", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:08:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4dc/4dc182ddae7c69c4edceb3bc5fa4eb39.jpg", "website": "http://www.gamertogamedeveloper.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 18, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GTGD"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GTGD"], "esrb_rating": null}
