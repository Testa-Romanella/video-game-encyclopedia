You wake up in the fading light of some protective crystals in a strange abyss, as Wisp calls you forth to bring power back to the core of this abyss.<br/>You'll travel through a few levels, defending against Haunt, focusing on positioning and avoidance rather than direct conflict.\u00a0<br/><br/>2020 Update :\u00a0</p>\n<p>2017 Initial Release :\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Witch &amp; Wisp was my submission for the 2017 UE4 Megajam<br/>Code and visuals by Samuel Burnett (Desktoy)<br/>Audio by Scott Burnett (Lost Izalith)<br/>It was my first entry into a gamejam and I was quite happy with the result. Unfortunately I didn't know how to package the game properly and much of the text didn't render correctly.<br/>I left the project for a few years but lately I've been going back through some old projects, sprucing them up a bit and releasing them here in case anyone is interested, but also just for archiving purposes.<br/><br/>The whole game should take 15 - 30 mins to play through and is pretty buggy. The V1 download was the original 2017 release and V2 is the updated (though still buggy) 2020 release.<br/><br/>___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>To play, use WASD to move, mouse to look around and right click to create barriers with the Wisp.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T08:10:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d65/d65dae5dc1c623f49d6cc54d6c68bc51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Desktoy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
