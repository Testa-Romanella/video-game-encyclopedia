{"id": 251411, "slug": "around-grumium", "name": "around (grumium)", "name_original": "around (grumium)", "description": "<p>around\u00a0 is a small game written in C++. It uses the free library SFML.</p>\n<p>The game supports 2-4 player local multiplayer. (sorry, no single player and no ai) The last player with a main base wins the round. You can spawn units to attack the enemy or repair your buildings. To increase your income you can build mines and to establish a defense line you can build towers. Spawning units additionally gives you energy which you can use for some spells.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>The game has a very simplistic control scheme. You only have 4 buttons to play: Up, Down, Left and Right. Use Up and Down to select an action in your HUD and use Right to execute the action clockwise and Left to execute it counterclockwise.</p>\n<p>Units start walking in the selected direction and buildings spawn on the first free capture point left or right from your main building. For spells the direction does not matter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Damage Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>The damage a unit or building deals depends on their current health value. Units deal exactly the amount of their HP as damage.\u00a0Buildings have an additional defense value of 2. This means they receive\u00a02\u00a0less damage from a unit and deal 2 more damage to them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Info</strong></p>\n<p>You can find additional info about all units, buildings and Spells ingame under the Help section or when you pause the game during a match.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64f/64fb97a1f8a6f46a494413ed3a162f90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["grumium"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
