In a 10x10 grid, the idea is to build on top of open tiles. You start off with the ability to place coal mines. As coal is collected, energy is provided to depleting power reserves bar, which represents the power demand of a city. As you build more and more mines, the demand will go down. <br/></p>\n<p>Though coal is not very clean. You can spend the well earned money on passive upgrades, as well as researching into Oil, Solar, and Hydro power. Once the power demand becomes positive, try increasing the number of cities you supply power to, and see how far you can get.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ce/8ce854d159edc6ee9f8e2a8dd8d9a383.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["agmcleod"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
