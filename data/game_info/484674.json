Play games with all your Chat's customized avatars while they participate and, in some cases, control their character via typing in Twitch Chat. One of the unique and amazing parts about Chatteract is that it only needs to be run on the Streamer's PC. Chatter's will only need to download the game on Steam to customize their unique avatars with free, earned, and upcoming purchasable items on the Steam Store. The best part about Chatteract is that it is <strong>free </strong>to play and will help connect Streamers and their Chat without any barriers to entry.<h3>Games Available Now:</h3><ul><li>Deathrun<br/></li><li>Traffic <br/></li><li>AC130 <br/></li><li>Target Practice<br/></li><li>Chat Cannon<br/></li><li>4 in a Row<br/></li><li>For The King<br/></li><li>Chat-Libs<br/></li><li>Apples &amp; Arrows</li></ul><h3>Customizable Avatar - Coming Soon!</h3><ul><li> Hats<br/></li><li> Shirts<br/></li><li> Weapons<br/></li><li> Masks and Faces<br/></li><li> Backpacks<br/></li><li> Character Emotes<br/></li><li> Sub-Emotes<br/></li><li> Winner Emotes<br/></li><li> and much more!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-27T17:19:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/0230f81d0966c5bee37c917cd7b58616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Chatteract"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Chatteract"], "esrb_rating": null}
