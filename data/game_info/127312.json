With 12 levels of tossing and turning inside a massive box, the simple goal of making it to the finish line in the center might not be as straightforward as it appears.</p><p>System recommendations:\u00a02.4GHz processor,\u00a0 4GB RAM,\u00a0300MB disk space.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure of the exact system requirements, so I\u00a0recommend test-driving the FREE DEMO before purchasing. It has all the functionality of the full game, just with fewer levels.
