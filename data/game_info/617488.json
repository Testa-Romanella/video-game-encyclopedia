You rely on a generator to keep ticking. However, things aren\u2019t lookin\u2019 good hon. Wicked tumbleweeds are coming for your generator, desiring to harvest its power.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Build turrets to laser those weedy brutes before they can siphon power from your generator. When a tumbleweed dies, they will drop a coin. Collect these to build more turrets to improve your defense.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a catch: <em>you and your turrets are joined together.</em>\u00a0Once you leave the range of your generator or turret, your power will start to run out. Sprint to collect coins and place your turrets wisely.</p>\n<p>You can stop some tumbleweeds, but they'll just keep coming. Fight them off for as long as you can!\r\n</p>\n<p>CREDITS<br/>Created by Commarchinin &amp;\u00a0Slashnburn\u00a0for GMTK Game Jam 2021 ('Joined Together')<br/>Developed by Commarchinin<br/>Art by\u00a0Slashnburn &amp; Commarchinin<br/>Music by Commarchinin</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:47:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b15a82100ba5606b3df24a83fc7fdf4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["commarchinin"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
