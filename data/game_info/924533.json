The jam took place between February 3th and February 5th and the\u00a0theme of jam was:\u00a0<strong><em>Roots</em></strong>. We also took part of 3 Diversifiers:</p>\n<ul><li><em>\u00a0</em><strong><em>Sharing is caring</em></strong>:\u00a0Share your source code on GitHub repository</li><li><strong><em>The Number 23</em></strong>:\u00a0Use themes of\u00a0change, progress, innovation, new beginnings, revolution, and transformation</li><li><strong><em>Is This The End?</em></strong>:\u00a0Make game with multiple endings</li></ul>\n<p>For our project we focused on the game design Lens\u00a0Game as a Toy. We aimed to create a game that is fun to play and interact with even without any particular goal in mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong><strong>ULES</strong></p>\n<p>The state of the game is controlled by a Stochastic cellular automaton. At all times each cell is either alive (=has roots/seed on it)\u00a0or dead. As new generation start, each cell determines their state for the next generation depending on the number of the 8 neighbouring cells and random chance.</p>\n\n<strong>Rules for Alive cells</strong>:If number of the alive neighbors matches this setting there is a random chance (based on the value of the slider:\u00a00% - 100%) for it staying alive. Otherwise it dies.<strong>Rule for Empty Spaces:</strong>If number of alive neighbors matches this setting, there is a random chance (based on the value of the slider:\u00a00% - 100%) for it becoming alive. Otherwise it stays dead.<strong>Root Lives:</strong>If this slider is active, if defines number of \"lives\" for alive cells. When the cell should die, it\u00a0instead loses one life point until they have no lives left.<strong>Root max lifespan:</strong>If this slider is active,\u00a0this slider sets an maximum number of generations a cell can consecutively stay alive. After that the cell will die despite any other rule.<strong>Rule of being born without\u00a0orthogonal neighbors:</strong>This rule prevents any cell being born without any orthogonal neighbors. This guarantees that the roots never grow diagonally for which there is no graphical representation in our system. This rule cannot be changed by the player.\r\n<p><strong>RESOURCES</strong></p>\n<p>GitHub repository:\u00a0https://github.com/jesnuka/RootsOfLife</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T15:40:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bdd7b23552363076a1335a55fde08b86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Brandon", "Jesnuka", "lrdazrl", "Minskuju"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
