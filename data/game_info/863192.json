Can she outwit <strong>her most cunning foe </strong>yet... <strong>a future version of\u00a0herself</strong>?<br/></p><p>This game was hastily assembled over 72 hours for Ludum Dare 51 and it shows.<br/></p>\n<p>There's quite a few little unpolished edges, but the game is playable and finish-able. However, the time looping every ten seconds just sucks in retrospect.</p><p>So in order to get a reasonably nice experience<strong>, hit the 'P' key to toggle the menu</strong> as soon as the game starts and crank that bad boy up to 1=10.</p><p>There's some handy hints at the end of each loop if you get stuck, and once you've 'solved' the loop you'll need to wait for the loop to time out too<strong>*</strong>, so <strong>take advantage of the time controls in the pause menu</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>There's also\u00a0an overlooked feature where you have to type words that include the letter 'p'. The pause menu opens when you do this, so pretend this is a 4th wall breaking meta-joke - perhaps this whole game is occurring inside the mind of a sentient bear librarian.<strong>**</strong></p><p>Post jam version on the way, probably with no time loop.<strong>***</strong> As it turns out, point and click adventures tend to be very measured and patient affairs where having time to linger and think enriches the world and the experience.</p><p>Results are going to vary if you decide to fullscreen, please let me know if specific dimensions are bad/good.</p><p><strong>*</strong>because \"someone\" forgot to uncomment a test setting when they submitted the final version\u00a015mintes before leaving for work</p><p><strong>**</strong>this probably makes more sense than the actual plot</p><p><strong>***</strong>As it turns out, point and click adventures tend to be very measured and patient affairs where having time to linger and think enriches the world and the experience.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:33:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/090/090b7aea418ba42ec29569e6f56c3449.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fizzbark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
