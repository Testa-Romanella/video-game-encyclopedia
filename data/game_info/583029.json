I visited a lady\u2019s booth and began to dig through a box of old records.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I stumbled upon some Kansas and others, but one record stood completely out to me.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The cover looked very interesting; a woman butterfly hovering over a castle with a fountain.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The cover really sold me, and the vibe of the record had been from the 80s.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Eager to get home and see what kind of genre the record was. I placed the needle on the record and immediately was taken back to the 80s.\r\n</p>\n<p>The music gave an 80s arcade sound.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Which I\u2019m sure this is where Techno music originated from.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The band \u201cStarcastle\u201d is an American progressive rock band from Champaign, Illinois and was formed in 1969. I wanted my story to resemble the 80s and show how a concert would have been back then.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The character gets home and plays the vintage record she has just bought. She plays it and is automatically transferred from the time, to a \u201cStarcastle\u201d concert in San Francisco, 1978.\u00a0 Lost, the girl character asked around for help only not to be given any.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>She runs to this very smoky valley girl bathroom, and talks to a lady who gives her information of what year it is. In disbelief, she walks outside to get some air.\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0However, her being an attractive girl gets backstage to meet \u201cStarcastle\u201d.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The lead singer gives the character their album to play on their record player. She plays it and is transferred back to real time. The colors or course needed to resemble the late 70\u2019s going into the 80\u2019s. So very bright and neon colors were expected for some parts of the story. However, when she is outside it\u2019s supposed to be dark with light from the cars illuminating. The transitions I used really fit well with my story. The wave effect when she is being transported to the concert and back to when she is going back home, really fit well giving a weird illusion going on.\r\n</p>\n<p>Music is a portal to transfer us to that time of era. Music gives us a way to live and learn about a time we didn\u2019t get a chance to travel in.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:09:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b5805a5872a9284745a191169d9acd4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Christovi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
