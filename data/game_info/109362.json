It's designed in isometric 2D and gets its inspiration from Asian folklore and renowned survival horror games as Don't Starve.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDying after an accident, you both have one goal in mind : saving your inconscious children remaining in the car. You don't know it yet, but you're not the only spirits stuck in this forest.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tWith a flashlight as only weapon, you'll have to push your car out of this nightmare. The forest will not make it easy, so you'll have to resist your fears and coordonate your moves in order to break through the woods.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThis project is being developed in one month as a group work for a game design course. The only constraints were: \"make a shooter, but no FPS &amp; no 3D\". It has been a great opportunity to experiment the impact of ambient and hardcore level design on the player gaming experience, as well as working on a network.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\n<strong>Credits</strong><strong> :</strong>\n</p><p>\n<strong><em>Producer</em><br/>\n</strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tNicolas Delamare\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><em>Game Designers</em></strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCharli Huv\u00e9\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYann Florian\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><em>Developers</em></strong>\n</p><p>\r\n\tNans Cartier\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMaxime Delerin\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tSeamus O'Neill\r\n</p><p>\n<em><strong>Graphic Designer</strong><br/>\n</em></p><p>\r\n\tYoann D'Orlandi<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em><strong>Sound Designer</strong><br/>\n</em></p><p>\r\n\tTristan Pradens\r\n</p><p>\n<strong><em>Composer</em></strong><br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tAntoine Wert\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/50c/50cf4fb6efbbdff852833864e98f48a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nicolas Delamare"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
