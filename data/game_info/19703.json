First came the famine that devasted the populace. Next came the plague that added more unfortunate souls on Death\u2019s abacus. Finally came the great rain of fire, and death fell down on sinner and innocent alike, blood flooding the streets in place of water. The people, in their desperation, turned away from the Holy Mother Church and delved deep into pagan decadence or succumbed to the temptation of the Devil. You have been charged with the office of Inquisitor. It is up to you to investigate crimes against the one true faith and root out heresy--using any and all means necessary. As in all best computer RPGs--the most important choices are yours to make.<br/><br/>Inquisitor is a unique blend of action-oriented combat with a deep and involving tale of betrayal, torture, madness, and infernal damnation. Put your wits to the test as you collect evidence against possible heretics and put them to trial once they have been charged. Use the might of the Inquisition to extract a confession from your subjects, but be warned, use your power wisely or you will face the consequences. If a gritty old-school open-ended isometric RPG is what you looking for, look no further. Inquisitor will provide you with hours of gameplay and a dark, involving story.<br/><br/>Deluxe version bonuses:<br/><ul><li>Book \u2013 The Inquisitor Novel (pdf) <br/></li><li>Book \u2013 Revelation of Ezekiel (pdf) <br/></li><li>Artbook (pdf) <br/></li><li>Two-hour soundtrack (38 songs)</li></ul>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2012-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/050/050c96e6bc2909529c0aaceaa7d6e79b.jpg", "website": "http://inquisitor-rpg.com/", "rating": 2.5, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 45, "owned": 775, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 16, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 27, "suggestions_count": 592, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 28, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CINEMAX"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cinemax"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
