Will you befriend them, or focus on escaping?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This VN was part school project, all passion project. I started it as a way to see my own art in a video game a few months ago, which I began to use in art assignments to show my mentors how I was applying myself outside the classroom. The story is inspired by the DnD sessions hosted by my friend Remy (who also did many of the backgrounds) and I. It's rough around the edges, that's for sure- but it's the result of years of friendship. Thank you for checking out my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T19:46:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/847/84798798b565226e43bdfa331a65e5ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["YerDad"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
