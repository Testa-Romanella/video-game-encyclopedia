After a brick is destroyed the ball has to cross the middle of the screen to be able to break another one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-06T03:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a2/0a2c738d7c6132bae92310bb6f6c6411.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Sam Hersel", "Mornheo", "rlebron22"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
