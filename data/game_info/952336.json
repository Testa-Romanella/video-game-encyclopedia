The aim of this project was to make one mechanic, the grapple, and try to find as many ways as possible to use the grapple.</p>\n<p>This project was focused on mechanics design along side level design. I created multiple iteration on the grapple mechanics such as pulling objects, moving the player, activating buttons and activating bombs etc. I then created puzzle levels that utilize these mechanics on their own and together.</p>\n<p>Everything in this project was created by me apart from the sound, where I used royalty free sound effects. Models were made using blender and it was all put together using Unreal Engine.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:34:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8a/d8a4224a809296e6dee4cb85411eac68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tomwelchman"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
