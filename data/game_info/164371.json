Help him dodge obstacles.</p>\n<p>This game has no ending, its more of a challenge to see how far you can get. I may go back in and add a High Score list like I did in Lunar Lander game.</p>\n<p>The art in this game was taken straight from the show.</p>\n<p>Camp Camp Lunar Lander<br/></p>\n<p>Behind the Scenes:<br/>I was originally inspired to create this game because of the art style of the show. It leans so much into a 2d game that I just wanted to make something, anything based on it. So I created this and the Lunar Lander Clone. It originally was going to contain an easter egg that required you to run a specific number of feet and I had hidden more information in the Lunar Lander that would contain more info also, but I ran out of time and cancelled that idea.... Maybe next time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7df/7df9e5a79b1f49148bcda76fb24b0b28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gun Asylem"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
