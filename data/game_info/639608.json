You play as the Fair Knight, who is trying to find his purpose in the world. Will you choose to finish this knight's dreadful quest? Or will you\u00a0 follow your heart as a hero? No matter what path you take, I know that the Goddess Of Light will be proud of you. Tread forth, and venture forth into the depths of the unknown! Who knows, you may even make a friend or two along the way. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T08:27:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3be/3be02238613f86b2beba9d4d67ff5f9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devoted_Bastion"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
