It is set the morning of the day Lum, a centaur druid, leaves home to seek their destiny. It includes an inventory system as well as a hub-and-spoke narrative that updates as the player moves through the space and makes various choices.</p>\n\n<p>Cover image:\u00a0\"open door\"\u00a0by DorkyMum\u00a0is licensed with CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.
