Create your own conditions for victory or failure. Engineer complex objects to control and use in levels. <br/><br/>Freedom Physics is not like the usual game where you have a target/goal from the outset. It's More like a sandbox, and what you do with it, is up to you or the person who created the level/content.<br/>The main idea of how to \"Play the Game\" in Freedom Physics is actually to create your own content/levels/scenarios etc.<br/>Yet though they are more so intended as examples rather than legit game content, you can still play with the pre-included content/levels. Even use them as starting points for your own levels, copy, edit and save them. What the goal of each level (if any) is will vary from level to level.<br/>There is also a dedicated page/site for uploading/viewing/downloaded other levels &amp; content created by other users!<br/><br/><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Some levels and content, such as local multiplayer intended levels may require use of at least 1 controller.</strong><br/><br/>Full Info, Documentation and Video Tutorials can be found here: http://undeniable.info/FreedomPhysics/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T02:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6e/d6e703f81244943d2d7c40255244d648.jpg", "website": "http://undeniable.info/FreedomPhysics/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nolan Ritchie"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Nolan Ritchie"], "esrb_rating": null}
