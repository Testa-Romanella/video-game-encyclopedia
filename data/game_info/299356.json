{"id": 299356, "slug": "dodekai", "name": "Dodekai", "name_original": "Dodekai", "description": "<p>This is an alpha/prototype, so just about nothing you see in this game is final, should this project ever reach a final stage.</p>\n<p>In Dodekai (Tentative Title), you are an observer of a dodecahedral planet cluster inhabited and maintained by tiny beings. Whether you choose to assume complete control over the growth of the cluster or prefer to watch its population form their own environments, you will see colonies form and dissolve on an ever morphing structure assembled of chunks of land.</p>\n<p>That being said, this Alpha has only little of this promise to offer. In this demo, all construction is controlled by the player alone, but they will get to experience a basic loop of harvesting resources to cultivate more. Be aware that it is possible to end up with not enough resources to keep going, though.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-04T05:05:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/384/3847dd75ab852a3b69fac091132b5408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["horrible"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
