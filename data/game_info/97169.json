While maintaining communication with Jones, their contact back on Earth, Jones suggests passing the time using a little ancient technology, a fishing rod, and the story begins.</p><p>Sashimi is a fishing game with light visual novel elements. It features voice acting (by me!) and a beautiful, relaxing environment to fish in.</p><p>Controls are explained in-game. However, if you want to change the volume, use the +/- keys.</p><p>This game was created for Ludum Dare 36's jam. The theme was ancient technology (I realise my link to the theme is tenuous...)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/023/023089d3e1f2b7a2d1a8d3e084f7b8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pixelbear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
