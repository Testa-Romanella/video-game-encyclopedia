You'll see. Life and school and things is stressful, so it's really nice to come to work, listen to music and just vacuum.<br/><br/>We got all kinds of machines you'll get to use. There's the iCapsol for agitating the carpet. That's after it been sprayed down with soap of course. And then there's the Prowler, which sucks all the soap and water out of the carpet after we've scrubbed it. When you empty the water out of the Prowler, is the most digesting and satisfying color you'll ever see. Trust me.<br/><br/>My favorite though is the Tennant. You'll use it at the end of the shift. There are two speeds on the dial \u2013 turtle or rabbit. If the floor is extra dirty you'll use turtle but for the most part rabbit is the way to go. But even on rabbit, it moves slower than you've ever walked in your whole life. Walk the slowest you can possibly walk, and then go even slower. That's the Tennant on rabbit. I normally prop a book up on it and read while it goes. I read most of The Picture of Dorian Gray this way!<br/><br/>We're lucky here because we have the best boss. Alvan. FYI he loves Pepsi, makes knives and will always remembers your birthday. And twice a year he throws a waffle party!<br/><br/>So, here's your keys. You can hook them onto your belt loop. These will get you into most of the rooms in this building except for the super cool air duct room in the basement. But I'll show you how to get into there later.<br/><br/>Ok, let's go take a look at the scariest room in the building now, that way you'll know where to be nervous while locking up alone.<br/></p>Use the W A S D keys for movement, and the mouse to look around. I'll make a video how to use these controls soon :)<p>Included below is a video walkthrough in case you aren't able to access this, or if the controls are too difficult, or for whatever reason.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Concept, direction, and audio by Natalie Wood<br/></p><p>Ben Esposito's First Person Drifter Controller for Unity3d</p><p>Unity</p><p>Blender</p><p>Put together by Daniel P.
