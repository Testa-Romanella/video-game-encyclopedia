He collects different berries that and if he gets enough of any kind, he turns into the \"Mr. Berry\" of that flavor. Mr. Berrys are the superpowered personas of little James, they are the berry empowered forms of him. The overarching story of why little James travels his world and the teased berry worlds to collect his Mr. Berry forms is still under development but the berry types were ones he was name-called by teasing kids,. I worked mostly on created a base for my future speedster game through the first Mr. Berry unlockable in the game, \" Mr. Cherry Berry\" who has super-speed when used. I wanted to create a tutorial system for this game that would instruct you on how to use whatever new Mr. Berry you unlocked, with minimal use of written or graphic instruction. </p><p>Controls (soon to be shown in-game):</p><p>WASD / Arrows : movement</p><p>F : Turn to Little James</p><p>G (with enough cherries) : Turn to Mr. Cherry Berry</p><p>Space : Jump</p><p>\" / \"  : Return to Menu</p><p>----JoyStick (PS4,USB)----</p><p>Left Analog : Movement</p><p>Right Trigger : Return to Menu</p><p>where the square and circle would be transforms you (different numbers for controllers)</p><p>Square : Turns to Little James</p><p>Circle (with enough cherries) : Turns to Mr. Cherry Berry</p><p>X : Jump</p><p>It will be completed, enjoy the beta for now!~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b3/3b386a088df16b9107537e640ee92f2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JW.Berry"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
