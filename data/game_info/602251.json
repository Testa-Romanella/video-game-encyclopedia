In &quot;Winning Post 9 2020,&quot; we have implemented an Inheritance system. Our system, made popular in the &quot;Winning Post 8&quot; series, allows the player to marry a character in the game. The children that are born can then be raised as jockeys and trainers. These children can cooperate to face rivals, or even face off against each other, creating a deeply immersive, highly dramatic experience for them.<br />\nAlso, the Bond command function has been powered up. Not only it is easier to use, it has grown into a highly strategic system, where the right timing can hold the key to victory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-26T16:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fca/fcaece359b7720123ad3b2ed5babb03a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 17, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC"], "developers": ["KOEI TECMO GAMES CO"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Koei Tecmo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
