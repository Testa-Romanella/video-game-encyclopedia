See how long you can make it before becoming contaminated by the plague!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>- 3 custom gameplay backgrounds</p>\n<p>- Custom soundtrack and sound effects</p>\n<p>- Some crude totally perfect and flawless animation skills by me</p>\n<p>As this is a beta version, I have exported it with debug so you can see\u00a0how badly it's made what errors come up. If you notice anything, I'm happy to listen and learn. This is the first really playable game I've made with an actual engine.</p>\n<p>I used Godot to make this. I hope you like it! I\u00a0have many ideas for how to improve the game, and in the future I'm looking to add a plethora of content. Who knows? Maybe it'll even... go viral.</p>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: Shooting the virus in CoronaBuster does not improve the real-world COVID-19 situation. If you really want to help, wear a mask, get vaccinated, and donate to genuine causes.
