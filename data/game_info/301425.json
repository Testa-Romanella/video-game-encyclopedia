Shoot your way through diverse alien planets while strategically gathering traps and resources for the epic boss fights. Defend your planet and stop the catastrophic Rogue Star from annihilating everything.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The Rogue Star</strong></p>\n<p>Our galaxy is about to be destroyed. A massive Rogue Star has formed from the cosmos and is on a direct collision path. It threatens to vaporize everything. Leaders from planets around the galaxy have assembled a top team of fighters to stop the Rogue Star at all costs. We are the Team.</p>\n<p>The evil aliens from a neighboring galaxy see the Rogue Star as an opportunity to destroy their long time rivals. They learn of the Team and rush to their galaxy to their plans while the Rogue Star inches ever closer.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Galaxy</strong></p>\n<p>The Galaxy is a collection of diverse planets with strange inhabitants. Choose your own non-linear path through the galaxy and explore each planet carefully. Planets such as the Terra, Beach, Steampunk, Ice, Desert, Fire, Toxic, and Haunted. The map of the galaxy is always expanding, with mysteries and surprises around every cover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Heroes</strong></p>\n<p>Choose from one of the elite team members, each with a personal drive to save their home planet from annihilation. You will interact with other team members throughout your quest. They may stop by to help you fight on their home planets or contact you with useful tips about your mission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weapons and Items</strong></p>\n<p>Discover and unlock dozens of unique items. Collect different combinations of guns and passive items to enable powerful synergies. You'll find everything from advanced space weaponry to historical weapons and everything in between. On top of carrying your main gun, you'll also have an arsenal of powerful grenades ready at the tap of a button.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traps and Defense</strong></p>\n<p>While exploring each planet you must gather traps and resources to face an epic boss and his waves of minions. Strategically place traps that slow, block, push, spike, burn, freeze and shoot at enemies. Upgrade your traps to make them stronger, and choose specialized attributes based on your player.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your Choices, Your Ending</strong></p>\n<p>Choose which planets you travel to and make important decisions that decide the fate of your galaxy. Each outcome is different. Will you save the galaxy from total annihilation? Or perhaps be vaporized in the process?<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Fully playable with gamepad or keyboard+mouse</li><li>Roguelite procedural levels with 300+ rooms to explore on 2 unique planets</li><li>Play as the main hero of the team</li><li>10+ enemies and mini-bosses</li><li>30+ guns and passive items and 15+ different traps</li><li>Use traps to defend against the mini-bosses</li><li>Upgrade your trap strategically with gathered coins </li><li>Choose your own path while exploring the planet system</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bullet hell roguelite top-down shooter</li><li>Fast-paced dynamic combat system</li><li>Tower defense elements</li><li>Procedural levels generation</li><li>Modular nonlinear storylines</li><li>12 worlds, +secret worlds</li><li>5 playable characters</li><li>100+ endings\u00a0</li><li>Thousands of unique hand-designed rooms</li><li>Hundreds of guns</li><li>Hundreds of passive items</li><li>Original pixel art</li><li>Numerous references to the greatest works of science fiction</li><li>Retro nostalgia and style</li><li>Fully playable with keyboard+mouse and controllers.\u00a0\r\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ALPHA ROAD MAP PLAN <br/><br/></strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be releasing large updates every two weeks, introducing new worlds, enemies, items, guns, soundtracks, and many other cool features, both planned and suggested by you.<br/></p>\n<p>To clarify our plans, here is our road map for the following three months:</p>\n<p><strong>April 5th</strong></p>\n<ul><li>3rd Planet will be playable and mostly finalized (Tropical Beach)</li><li>Inclusion of more environmental hazards</li><li>40+ guns and items in total</li><li>Additional enemies and boss</li><li>3rd soundtrack</li><li>400+ rooms</li><li>Additional polish and refinement</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>May 3rd</strong></p>\n<ul><li>4th Planet will be playable and mostly finalized (Steam Punk)</li><li>50+ guns and items in total</li><li>Additional enemies and boss</li><li>4th soundtrack</li><li>500+ rooms</li><li>Additional polish and refinement</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>May 31st</strong></p>\n<ul><li>5th Planet will be playable and mostly finalized (Alien Ship)</li><li>60+ guns and items in total</li><li>Additional enemies and boss</li><li>5th soundtrack</li><li>600+ rooms</li><li>Additional polish and refinement</li></ul>\n\n<p>We\u2019d like to note that the roadmap is a living thing and may be changed depending on your feedback and how things progress.
