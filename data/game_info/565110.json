The friendly voice of Dr. Nosfet from many floors above guides the player through the only way out - the Modular Cubic Relocator (MCR) testing protocol.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game uses many different puzzle elements to keep the tests fresh and fun:</p>\n<ul><li>A throwable cube the player can teleport to.\u00a0</li><li>A throwable crate to place on buttons</li><li>Floor buttons to activate other testing elements, including the exit door.</li><li>Trampolines that bounce the player, cube or crate as high as they fell from.</li><li>Different fields that can block the player or throwable object while letting the other pass through.</li><li>Retractable windows.</li><li>A laser that lets the player to teleport to any reciprocating panel.</li><li>...plus many more!</li></ul>\n<p>Even though the many elements make the puzzles exciting, there are some\u00a0extra parts of the game that make it even more interesting:</p>\n<ul><li>Explore behind-the-scenes areas not normally\u00a0accessible to the average test subject.</li><li>Humorous signs and posters, some of which provide important lore to the history of Searchlight Services.</li><li>Find a collection of 8 different notes in secret areas throughout the game to piece together even more of the story.</li><li>There is an additional secret area that provides no additional story but is very hard to find so props to you if you do. (You won't)</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is 9 months in the making and was made mostly on my own (one other person did the voiceover and made a couple of textures for me). I am not a graphical artist so it may not look the best but I guarantee you will have some fun playing it.</p>\n<p>Don't be put off by the difficulty of the game. Testing has shown that while some of the puzzles can be quite\u00a0hard, finally figuring out the solution is very satisfying. I don't intend on releasing a walkthrough but if the demand is there then I might make one in time.</p>\n<p>The game should take you about around 2 hours to complete on your first playthrough but will be considerably quicker if you want to play it again.</p>\n<p>By all means, tell me what you think in the comments! If you think the game is bad then please let me know why so that I can use this learning experience in future projects!</p>\n<p>It is recommended that you play this game with a mouse and not a trackpad if you have the option. Some parts of the game require quick and precise movements that will be much harder with a trackpad.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T03:36:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/740/7409f38cd4fe3f555476f1c299050cb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sam Reynolds"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
