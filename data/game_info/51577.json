At the moment you can build a good sized drum set almost being able to cover any song! You can move and rearrange the drums into any position you choose making some very cool drum sets and very crazy ones if you choose! The triggers on the controllers control the kick drums making it more convenient to play. The game has a double kick drum kit only available at the moment for more of a metal feel. There will be more kit options later in the game for HiHats instead of double bass drums or even having both at the same time for more experimentation! Updates will come very frequently and some changes will be made to the gameplay!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/583a8bfb04ee0200fbd341239d3c3763.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["James"], "esrb_rating": null}
