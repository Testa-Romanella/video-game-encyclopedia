There are three endings in total, which complements the plot.</p><p>The two bars on the corner records how much the cat scratched and the owner's mood. If the scratching is being caught, a red sign will appear above the owner's head, and her mood would drop. These two stats are related to the endings.</p>\n<p>AD to move left and right.</p>\n<p>Space to jump.</p>\n<p>J to scratch furniture</p>\n<p>K to interact with furniture</p>\n<p>L to end the game and see the ending you get.</p>\n<p>R to restart the game all over again.</p>\n<p><strong>1: game description</strong></p>\n<p>This game is about me and my cat.The player plays as the cat, explores some particular rooms of my home, makes comments about furniture, and scratches them. I chose this topic for several reasons. She is a stray cat I adopted when I was in high school. This lovely cat always stays on my bed and sleeps with me at night. She helped me to come over a lot of difficulties in my life, and without her comfort I may not even be here now. Another reason is related to an incident this summer. If you trigger the special ending in this game, you will know.</p>\n<p><strong>2: my process</strong></p>\n<p>The initial idea is my cat hiding behind furniture and scratching them. I had this idea simply because she is naughty sometimes. But as a sidescroller, where to hide becomes blurry and may confuse players. So I chose to set up a distance detector between the AI \u201cme\u201d and my cat. In this way, the cat\u2019s task is scratching furniture and avoiding being caught by me. Then I decided to write some short brief sentences about myself, by interacting with furniture, the player can know a little bit about myself, from the cat\u2019s view.</p>\n<p><strong>3: one specific development challenge and how I solved it\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>The message box is so hard to code. I do not know much about canvas and text stuff. So I asked a professional for help. After some tutorial videos and documentation reading, we figured it out. By using switch, I was able to print the words I want. He also composed the music of this game.
