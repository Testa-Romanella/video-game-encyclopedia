{"id": 414347, "slug": "hovelhome", "name": "Hovelhome", "name_original": "Hovelhome", "description": "<p>This is unfortunately a very broken and unfulfilled version of the original concept of the game. The plan I had in mind definitely was pretty big in scope, and I blame myself for that. I've worked very hard during this week and have disrupted my sleeping schedule to make this as close to the original concept as I could make it, but I can hardly bring myself to call this a game. If you are still curious about what it's like, you'll find most of the action in the ground hole you discover in the first scene where thugs try to gun you down, but due to this being the jam version that it is, you can't die either. So you can play around with the various guns I made. I will try to make this into the game that it deserves to be. In the meantime, you can enjoy the art that I made for the game.
