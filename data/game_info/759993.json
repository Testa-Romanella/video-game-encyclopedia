The biggest feature of VR is that it reproduces a sense of distance close to reality by using binocular parallax. If this feature is incorporated into the game, I think that a game unique to VR can be created. In this game, we will use the intersections of the rays of light emitted from the left and right hands. At that intersection, trace the maze that floats in space. Would you like to try your sense of distance?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T14:15:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d19/d196cdd2b1c07c46d54812193e7852b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RayReflection"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
