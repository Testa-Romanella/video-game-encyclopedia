Rather than the traditional system of multiple choice or having AI synthesize commands you type, reader-submitted actions are ran through google forms, and whichever one I like the most gets chosen. Less of a game; more of a webnovel. <br/><br/>If you don't like reading yet are very conditioned to playing videogames, who knows? You might enjoy Voiden;Scape. Also, I can't promise incredible quality or anything like that; I know nothing about code and am creating this game in Twine just for the hell of it. Have a suggestion? Utilize the comments!\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for playing. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T08:36:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/405/405998825bf747da57ecfc902e4bd1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hazardly"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
