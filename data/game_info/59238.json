All levels are carefully handcrafted (not randomly generated) to challenge even the most seasoned puzzle platformer fan's understanding of physics, time, and space. <br/><br/><strong>No one escapes the Continuum unscathed.</strong><br/><br/><br/><ul><li> 2D Puzzle platformer<br/></li><li> Dark pixel art style with an ambient horror soundtrack<br/></li><li> 30 Handcrafted levels (no procedural generation)<br/></li><li> Includes 6 tutorial levels and 9 \"extra hard\" remix levels at the end for a formidable challenge<br/></li><li> Rotate the environment to change gravity<br/></li><li> Portals<br/></li><li> Clones<br/></li><li> Character death becomes a puzzle element<br/></li><li> Time manipulation<br/></li><li> 34 Individual achievements to gather<br/></li><li> Includes a slew of timed achievements for speedrunners</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56eb7c2ed6bbd62fb72b539a78ad9fc1.jpg", "website": "http://thezaxisgame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Lazerpants Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Lazerpants Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
