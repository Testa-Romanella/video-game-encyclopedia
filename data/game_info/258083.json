You use your energy boots to jump from wall to wall to reach the top of the building. There will be power up backpacks that will let you fly up further but only for a limited amount of time. Drones and lasers are the main enemy that you need to avoid. You will also have a device that lets you transform into an enemy drone for short amount of time to trick the actual enemy and make going up easier.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/297/2979b8f3c0b1b8c7cf09540f520d2d33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bozon", "Shender"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
