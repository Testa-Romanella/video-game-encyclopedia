In this Dream Kingdom, human race is the master, and the legendary elf is the most intelligent creature. Elves live on an island in the southeast of the mainland, but no one knows the specific location of the island. Only a few seamen claimed to have seen them on the voyage, but no one can describe exactly what they look like.<br/><br/>The style of Dream Kingdom is fresh and esthetical and the characters are generated by lovely cartoons. The game adopts real-time fighting mode, which has a strong expressive force, and will give the players a tense and exciting experience. The game has a very rich dressing system: all hair, clothes, weapons and pet accessories can be changed! <br/><br/>As another feature of the game, pet system is even more remarkable. Compared with other games, pets in Dream Kingdom play an important role. They can talk to their owners, evolve, and even master pet skills. Additionally, you can order them to produce weapons and armor, and synthesize ornaments and props. In the dream Kingdom, pets will be your important partners.<br/><br/>Install Dream Kingdom, and see you then!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T01:59:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e5/7e5eca322eaee991d5defb020b7fc916_wW0HLDp.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 193, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Zhen Chen"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Zhen Chen"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
