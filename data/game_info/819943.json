You can learn what the faces do by hovering over them, and clicking to select. If you don't like what you see, you can simply just re-roll the die to cancel the face setting.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Above the shop you'll see the point tally, which also has a history of all the points you have received recently.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>There's a large timer on the wall, when that runs out, you move on to the next round.
