{"id": 670763, "slug": "the-simple-series", "name": "The Simple Series", "name_original": "The Simple Series", "description": "<p>The \"Simple Series\" is a collection of short adventure games that some friends and I created many years ago, mostly in high school. The games are episodic and mostly linear, with a mix of story telling (including way too many inside jokes, especially early on) and small mini-games that range from puzzle to action to strategy. This was the first set of games of any significant size we ever actually completed beyond a level or two of early prototypes.</p>\n<p>The games are mostly controlled via mouse, with a few places that require keyboard input. A check-point system was later added so you can resume your progress after you lose in many funny ways. The episodes start a bit random and slow, but the series slowly develops a plot and gets interesting if you invest the time. Don't take the games too seriously: they're all ridiculous and are meant to be funny.</p>\n<p>These games were made in HyperCard, the legacy Mac application that allowed users to create applications or games using simple scripting tools. The browser version is running a version of the Mini vMac emulator, and doesn't perform as well as the downloadable version (most notably: the sound stutters).</p>\n<p>(See license file inside of disk image for more details)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T02:34:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f711b1ece659df781434f03d35f96a91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mattj375"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
