The book  inventory of other players is visible to all, so we can make a guess on  what color each is looking to acquire.\r\n </p>\r\nSpecial abilities\r\n<ul><li>Rogue:\u00a0pickpocket, steal a\u00a0book from an\u00a0opponent at short range</li><li>Barbarian: stomp, intimidate an opponent into dropping all their books</li><li>Mage:\u00a0swap trap,\u00a0drop a trap that\u00a0will grab\u00a0one of\u00a0the opponents books when triggered </li></ul>\r\nInventory limit\r\n<p>The player inventory can hold 5 items. If a sixth item is acquired, the first is dropped.\r\n </p>\r\nPlayers\r\n<p>Up to 4 players connect to a map to play. The first to collect 4 matching books wins. Spawn points are fixed in the corners of the map.\r\n </p>\r\nMaps\r\n<p>Maps should be sufficiently large that not all books can be acquired  immediately. Books should be spawned at fixed spawn points on the map.\r\n </p>\r\nMore to be considered\r\n<p>It should be possible to load maps as an external resource using godot's DLC features. Further, the game could take advantage of some fediverse infrastructure to find new user-contributed maps, such as searching for posts with the #booksmartquartet hashtag with zip files attached.\r\n                  \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T06:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/549/5495d16e0287cd10d1f1a9f619b22dae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Armen138"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
