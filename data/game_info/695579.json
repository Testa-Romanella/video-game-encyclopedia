ONLY ON PC AND IOS BUILD!</strong></p>\n<p>This game is an adventure game where you play as a worker who just received a text from their girlfriend saying she\u2019s home alone and is dying to spend time with them. As you are currently at the office your task is to escape undetected with the help of keys to unlock doors. You are able to walk and run around but keep in mind people are roaming and will say something if they see and hear something suspicious. Try not to get caught too many times or you will be in big trouble. You are able to move freely around just remember you are supposed to be working.</p>\n<p><strong>Github repo:\u00a0https://github.com/jp5169/TFG</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:57:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/de5/de5b70e08f54f7e14adf2eafc7b56b82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["jp5169", "oscarivanramirez", "jasonzh", "TangoDevelopments"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
