Great work. Flawless.</p><p>Only available on Mac as I\u00a0didn't realize until 20 minutes ago I\u00a0cannot export to Windows from my mac. At least not while still getting to the deadline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the My First Game Jam of the Summer of 2022. I\u00a0knew nothing about programming going into this and decided that Unreal Engine was the way to go.<br/>My teammate did the art assets while I\u00a0\"handled\" the coding side of it. For a first go, this is just about what I\u00a0expected but somehow still less than what I\u00a0thought capable for two weeks worth of effort. Still, it's not perfect but it's still \"done\" :) Definitely planning on doing more jams in the future.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T15:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f68acb3a7768e84fc4112f453efd0f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["DevvyScoob"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
