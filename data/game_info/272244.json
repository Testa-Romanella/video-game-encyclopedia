This is a rough prototype of what we want the game to be.We only had two weeks to come together to execute our vision the best we could from our various places in the world. I'm proud of what we cobbled together! It's a short experience, but I hope that you enjoy the fruits of our labor.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Game Premise</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game takes place during WWII with resistance fighters of various nationalities aboard a train headed towards\u00a0a concentration camp. An unexpected winter storm flares up and freezes the train on the tracks. Our heroes take this chance to storm towards the engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Future Hope</strong><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0Ultimately, if we were to turn this\u00a0into a full project, we would make the story aspect stronger. While the game play itself would be fairly linear, the story's emotional depth would elevate the player's connection to the game/story. The game would be slower and more deliberate with choices having weight and each train car telling a quick snapshot of a story. Deciding who to save, who not to save, or whether or not one can continue to be a conscientious objector in the face of war and injustice are all aspects we would wish to explore!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33d/33db347842e08af6450b45ef4c0d4bd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zlanier21"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
