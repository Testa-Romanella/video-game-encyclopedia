The game is inspired in glap.io, a - now dead - io game where you could\u00a0build little space ships and travel around different planets.</p>\n<p>On Glap Explorum, the solar system is your sandbox. Explore the different moons and planets in search of useful modules to build your vessels. Make submarines, hovers, boats, rovers, satellites, spacecraft, zeppelin, and anything in between. Compete in minigames with online leaderboards.</p>\n<p>Every module, moon and planet is subject to an n-body simulation, unlike in most other space-exploration games where these are static or \"on rails\". This means that you can, say,\u00a0build a giant ship to push the Moon out of its orbit and crash it into the Earth, or place a satellite in a lagrange point between the Sun and the Mars. The only limit is your imagination! (and your experience with orbital mechanics)</p>\n<p>The game is currently in playtesting alpha, so most of the content is not yet implemented. Currently the game features 5 different locations to explore (excluding the sun), and around 8 different modules, as well as 1 minigame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the future, the game will have +30 locations, each with at least 1 native module; and multiple minigames.</p>\n<p>if you have a bug report or a suggestion, feel free to join the discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/9hB2ZQxr</p>\n<p>Keybinds:\u00a0</p>\n<p>mouse wheel: zoom</p>\n<p>middle mouse button: reset zoom</p>\n<p>WASD: movement</p>\n<p>QE: rotate</p>\n<p>CTRL: stop rotation</p>\n<p>ESC: pause</p>\n<p>M: minimap</p>\n<p>keybinds individual to each part can be seen in-game hovering the mouse over said part</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T04:37:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/53b/53b735016657d00c72f0bd3f64f88994.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Ezequiel-052"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
