While on the job the teleporter messes up and you both get separated from the rest of the work crew, and each other. Are you able to work together with your Walkie Hollies to get back home?<br/></p>\n<p>If you're stuck, remember there are only two inputs other than movement - LMB to activate the wand which reveals the yellow Ryneh remnants, and R/T to activate your Walkie Hollie with the other player, which is needed to see Hatwinch Ryneh pieces. Spam these buttons as you walk around and talk with your partner and I have confidence you'll be able to finish the game before watching this video.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Made in a week only by yours truly\u00a0for Epic's Unreal Jam 2020!<br/></p>\n<p>walkthrough and commentary, explanation of lore:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The two players get teleported to different times. The Walkie Hollies can communicate through time. If you can play through both areas, then you can notice a few differences. Different barrels, a tree log becomes a stump, and only the person in the future can look into the past to see 'recordings' of the past person walking around.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:34:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea7/ea73e5741389eafd48ba36dc01271f35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lapricap"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
