This game is an improved version of my last game \"DiversityBox\" and unlike it this game is written on the Unity engine and will be continued. If you're unfamiliar with the previous game, here's a brief explanation: This game is designed to relax your nerves, here you can do whatever you want using (currently) 75 different materials.</p>\n<p>Here are the following abilities:</p>\n<p>* Pause</p>\n<p>* Slow down time</p>\n<p>* Thermal vision</p>\n<p>* Ability to change the size of the field</p>\n<p>* Ability to save / load the field</p>\n<p>* Ability to customize the current material</p>\n<p>And this is not a final list, this is a list of what is already ready for the current version (v0.1.0.0b), in the future there will be 3 game modes and 2 times more materials.</p>\n<p>At the moment, ~ 110 hours of my free time have been spent on the creation of the game, I hope you will also spend at least a little of your time on this game</p>\n<p>WARNING: This game contains a lot of bright colors and shimmers, if this may affect your health then do not play this game.</p>\n<p>Important links here:</p>\n<p>* Our Discord:\u00a0 https://discord.gg/c4ES8WXm8b</p>\n<p>* Support the author on boosty:\u00a0\u00a0https://boosty.to/altaber</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-23T10:30:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb10aebd7ce5b7a2efc388d367078213.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AlTaberOwO"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
