Let me know if that worked out and if this one proves satisfying to complete! Or if its too easy even! I worry about that as well!!!<br/></p>\n<p>I also totally wanted to make this one as just an excuse to give the 'remake' treatment to another old game of mine: 'BOOMBOARD!',\u00a0 Game devs really DO only have couple repeating ideas don't they...
