Use your hands to defeat the seemingly endless hordes of maniacal spirits.</p>\n<p>Survive as long as you can. Your hands are your only weapons. Shoot with Right / Left mouse buttons. Move with WASD. I think you have to pick up ammo as well. Maybe. That's probably the spookiest thing!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>\n<p>This is not a finished game and therefore there will be huge amounts of (possibly game breaking) bugs. We hope you enjoy them.</p>\n<p>Head bob turned out to be framerate dependent, so if you get motion sickness, blame your fat rig! This may or may not be fixed in the future.</p>\n<p>Made for OMG Jam 5 by GDQ (\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/omgjam5\u00a0) November 2018.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7f/c7ff28fdbd001072da61a337f68836a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SqueakyHands"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
