I spent a lot of time trying to push this concept to make controls that felt faster, snappier and more fun. I've been working on this project on and off for years. I wanted to make game that pushes the advantages of designing a game around a physics engine.<br/><br/>I've been making my own level editor to work on this game with, which was a daunting task but I think it was worth it. I intend to ship this editor with the game, although it is currently disabled in the demo as it is extremely bare bones at the moment.<br/><br/>There's some mechanics that, unfortunately, didn't make the cut in the demo. But I would like to show them off soon. Things like wind, and deadly laser beams. There are also plenty more puzzles and platforming challenges. I have lots of levels already made, at least partially.<br/><br/>Most of the current art is placeholder. The plans for this project are to keep working on level concepts, and work with an artist/artists to refine the visuals. It also doesn't have music or sound yet (well, there's one sound effect). I haven't fully settled on the color palette. But, I'm in love with the game mechanics and the feel of controlling this little blob, so expect to see more of this game.<br/><br/>I've included some of my favorite levels that I thought wouldn't be too difficult and thrown together a quick demo of my passion project.
