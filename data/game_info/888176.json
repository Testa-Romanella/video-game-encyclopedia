I completed the game's programming and level design in my spare time. Although I wrote the source code as modular as I could, I don't plan to turn it into a full game at the moment.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: The coolest part about the game is rail-riding but it looks like Unity's particle system doesn't work well on web browsers and I later noticed even the post processing doesn't work so I have decided to cut out the WebGL version. Feel free to try the Windows version! Any comments are welcomed.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T09:22:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4a/e4af55c36ceb72e6d603ff2ab10ba4e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["limerain"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
