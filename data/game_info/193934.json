The first team to score 12 points wins the game. You play as the purple team with your hoop on the left side while the blue team has their hoop on the right side. While playing offense you can Move and Shoot or Pass once per turn. On Defense you can Move and attempt to steal the ball once per turn.</p>\n<p>To advance turns you must select each character and do their actions or end their turn. After this the other team will take their turn. <br/>This game was heavily inspired by old school tactical RPG's.</p>\n<p> I feel like I learned a lot from making this project and I hope you enjoy checking it out. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S,D - Move cursors<br/>Enter - Select Players, Menu Items<br/>E - End all Player Turns</p>\n<p>Good Luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e49/e49a8f9ce49bbce3213f7a9ebf0b9431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MonstermanMFR"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
