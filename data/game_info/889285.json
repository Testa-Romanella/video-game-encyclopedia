Some ships will be better suited for taking on certain enemies than others, but levels will be beatable regardless of whichever ship is chosen.</p>\n<p>The game features several game modes, inlcuding a boss rush, a high score mode and a story where levels will become progressively harder the more the player wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T17:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb7263815d6942f9de8e47df381b2f98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fritz"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
