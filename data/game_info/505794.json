You must go fast, that much is clear, but why? And how fast is too fast? <br/><br/>With intense highway driving, a story mode that gradually ramps up the difficulty, and a fresh world and road to master each time you get behind the wheel, Nightvision will have you in a cold sweat as you anticipate the next curve about to come into your headlights.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> Realistic seat-of-your-pants racing featuring the challenge of limited visibility; is that a sheer mountain pass lurking in the darkness, or a switchback on the edge of a cliff?<br/></li><li> Randomly generated terrain. Never the same drive twice.<br/></li><li> Lost desert highways engineered by RoadGen\u2122 artificial intelligence in real-time carve through the random hillsides.<br/></li><li> Engaging story integrated seamlessly without long cut-scenes taking away from the action.<br/></li><li> Sandbox mode: to practice, hand-craft unique challenges, or leave up to the RNG gods.<br/></li><li> One <strong>BILLION</strong> world seeds, four different RoadGen\u2122 algorithms, and over a dozen road and world settings, offer <strong>&gt;10 QUINTILLION</strong> levels. Play 'em all!<br/></li><li> Share your favorite level passphrases with your friends and dare them to make it as fast or as far. Or just repeat your favorites and try for better times.<br/></li><li> Literal <strong>Endless mode</strong> to test your endurance or just enjoy a relaxing drive.<br/></li><li> Spectacular crashes! Die over and over and love every minute. Wincing has never been so much fun.<br/></li><li> No map. No memorizing the \"track\". No getting bored.<br/></li><li> Unlockable, game-changing secret modes hearken back to the history of driving games and give a fresh visual take on the gameplay you love.<br/></li><li> Gripping original soundtrack that mirrors the tension of the drive.<br/></li><li> Experience the thrill (and fear) of what lies in the darkness ahead.</li></ul><br/><br/>What's makes Nightvision the Rogue-of-the-Road? There isn't Permadeath in the traditional Rogue sense. Instead, if you crash or don't go fast enough, you'll restart the same chapter but the level will be completely random within the same road and world characteristics. So you can't memorize a track, and instead have to rely purely on skill and technique... and maybe a little bit of luck.<br/><br/>You'll need to maintain your speed and your wits or you'll never make it...<br/>But make it where?It's light versus dark. <br/>It's risk versus reward. <br/>It's life or death. <br/>Whatever happens, you have to see the night through", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-16T02:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e25/e259ff3ce7d538c91b23622fd9198e26.jpg", "website": "https://NightvisionGame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoodust Enterprises"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hoodust Enterprises"], "esrb_rating": null}
