The first version of the New Idea Uni System 800. This mod is in the early stages so I will admit it is rather rough at the moment. There are no sounds or shadows but all of that will change very soon. I would also like to add that me and a few other modders are planing on taking this project to the stars! There are many things to come with this grand mod. I would like to thank Steve Hough for providing me with the model that it is out of this world!\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are more units that will be coming very soon as well as new headers. At the moment it is just the corn picker and let's say it has it's only issues. However this is only V.1.0.0 so please do not worry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Credits go as follows, Steve Hough for the model, Simply Devine Modding for ingaming, Jiggin4walleye for converting, and Emincan Yagiz for the coding.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T05:48:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fe/1fea1e0bc9cc2fdd5aca90d9981e24fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SimplyDevineModding"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
