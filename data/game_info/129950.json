Pengoos is a 3D penguin sumo wrestling game based off a popular mini-game in one of my favorite childhood games: Crash Bash (or I think there's another mini-game like it in Mario Party). I created this with multi-player in mind, but only had time to implement local multi-player. It supports two usb controller inputs, or the keyboard works fine if you don't have any of those. I should mention the controls are: w, a, s, d and space for player one and up, down, left, right and right-enter for player 2 because it doesn't specifically say it in the game. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/140f981c421d398c0fb13c0458ce939e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RoachDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
