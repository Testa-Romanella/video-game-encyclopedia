It requires two xbox one or 360 remotes connected to your computer to play. One player plays as a hunter and the other as a turkey. Chase down your Thanksgiving dinner or do your best not to end up on the table. This game is intended to be a friendly fast paced game.</p>\n\n<p>This was a rush project and has a few bugs that I know of. I hope to get some time over the next few days to clean it up some more but hope you will enjoy it how it is. If you find any bugs or errors or have a recommendation then feel free to drop it in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518da5e2d5928cfa78243344dca1c4e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DustinTGriffin"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
