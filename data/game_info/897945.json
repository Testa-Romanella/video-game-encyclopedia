In order to help memorialize Spellbreak and allow players to continue to enjoy the Hollow Lands, we created a standalone version where players can host their own servers, play with their friends, and explore the game-space at their own pace.\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing and being a part of the wonderful and passionate community that allowed us to bring Spellbreak to life. We wish you all the best!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>*********************************************</em></strong></p>\n<p>Unleash your inner battlemage in Spellbreak.\r\n</p>\n<p>When magic is forbidden, locked in the iron grip of the Vowkeepers, it\u2019s up to you to resist and reclaim what\u2019s yours. Harness the raw power of your gauntlets and tap into the unimaginable forces of the elemental planes . Soar into fierce battles, through floating islands and impossible terrain, to unleash the Breaker within.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>BUILD YOUR BATTLEMAGE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Choose a class: Frostborn, Conduit, Pyromancer, Toxicologist, Stoneshaper, or Tempest. Each has its own playstyle, which you can customize with talents as you grow in power. Which will you master?\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>COMBINE THE ELEMENTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A mighty battlemage isn\u2019t limited to just one ability. Seize hold of two powerful magic gauntlets and blend devastating spell combinations to control the battlefield with fiery tornadoes, electrified gas clouds, and more!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>BATTLE ACROSS THE HOLLOW LANDS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Explore the map and find tactical advantages to outplay your opponents. Discover hidden chests that contain magical runes and game-changing equipment. These items give you the ability to fly, teleport, control time, become invisible, and more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T15:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/536/536cf1d162fa1527b92551731a9224e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 489, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["sbcommunity"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
