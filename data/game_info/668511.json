Its free, so try it at give me feedback on how you thing it would work best.</p>\n<p><strong>Story/Idea</strong></p>\n<p>You are going home from work, after a long day. After you get to the subway station, you stand on the platform, and wait for your train to arrive. Minutes pass, and everyone in the station gets on and leaves, except you. Your train never arrives. Suddenly, there is only you left, along with one other shady man on the other side. You can see weird stuff happening on the otherside, but you only see changes after a train has passed. You never \"see\" him move.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Note: When the whispering starts, you can alt+f4. Nothing more happends after this, and i did not bother putting in an exit button lol.</p>\n\n<p>Tell me what you think!<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T06:42:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/510/5102a0f96c2fb0991a5eb0a88b4d4e38.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Saftblander"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
