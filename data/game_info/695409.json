The catch? You're pitifully tiny and weak. A single hit is all it takes to end you and your journey.</p>\n\n\n<p>But death is not the end.\u00a0 Your quest for more footwear is too strong to just give up like that.</p>\n\n<p>You possess the ReBoot, a mystical shoe that has the power to bring you back to life to try again... as long as it's charged. It's a little big for you to wear, but it's a hefty enough weapon to throw around - and hey, it's indestructible! Whenever you die, if the ReBoot's charged, you are reborn\u00a0 inside the boot, wherever it may be.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So throw it around! Block attacks, deal damage, and set yourself up to jump back into the action if you meet your demise.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>March onward, Sole Collector... but watch out for the other holders of these mystical boots - there's powers in podiatry.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-15T08:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c811ec184fc9cf9ffba8b0a2262ee778.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jay \"Camber\" Idema", "puglic", "Emily McNee", "YaBoiBells", "Piescj_GSAS", "PixelTaku"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
