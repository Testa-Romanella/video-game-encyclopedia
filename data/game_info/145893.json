You have to move the road tiles in order to create a straight path. However, if the cart reaches the crossroads, the roosters choose a turn randomly, so you have to be ready for every possibility. </p>\n<p>The goal is to enter the city, but since the gate is closed, you have to collect all the coins first.</p>Controls\r\n<ul><li>UP / DOWN \u2013 select next/prev row,</li><li>LEFT / RIGHT \u2013 move selected row</li><li>+/-/0 \u2013 volume controls</li></ul>\n<p>Made as a part of #1GAM challenge.</p>The Idea\r\n<p>One day, Lusi (my fianc\u00e9e) told me she had a dream about a game called \u201c\u017dito\u201d (Czech word for rye). Accidentally, it is also a name of a legendary\u00a0character\u00a0from Prague myths. \u017dito was a wizard/jester guy, famous for driving a cart pulled by a bunch of roosters. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll make my January #1GAM game about him,\u201d was my resolution.</p>The Fun Part\r\n<p>All the sound effects were recorded \u00a0home-made (using our bodily sounds and kitchen wares), the music is Lusi playing some generic medievalish tune on her ukulele. Even though it seemed a bit ridiculous, the gameplay seems to hold some fun potential \u2013 I found myself playing the game longer than is usual with my other prototypes.</p><p><strong>Date</strong>: 01/2013<br/></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: vim,\u00a0haXe NME, GIMP,\u00a0haXeFlixel<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/002/002d04e71f74bd1e3b1c994ba1f53b4e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jarnik"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
