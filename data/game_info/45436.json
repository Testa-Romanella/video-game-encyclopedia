They can even lose limbs depending on where they're hit or bitten.  Every beast in the game has a unique fighting style and attack pattern.Beast SoccerBBS includes a Soccer gamemode in which you can pit beasts against each other for a violent game of soccer.  Who plays better football: Brachiosaurus or Polar Bears?  Set up the match and find out for yourself!Weapon AttachmentsCustomize your beasts by attaching weapons to them like machine guns, flame throwers, and bomb vests.Challenge ModeIn challenge mode,  you must construct a team of beasts to complete a given task for each level.
