The visuals came from geometric Photoshop works I created, and I found sounds I felt fit into the game from freesound.org</li></ol></li><li>What does this style contribute to the gameplay?\u00a0<em>Include before / after screenshots in your response (your game before audiovisual phase + your game after audiovisual phase).</em><ol><li>This style helped denote certain game objects from one another. For example, it was hard to decipher which enemies hurt, and which enemies didn't. Through my game art, I have helped the player to better understand what is safe and unsafe when playing my game</li></ol></li><li>What was the most challenging aspect of the audiovisual phase for you?<ol><li>The most challenging aspect of this audiovisual phase was sound. I had a lot of difficulty when it came to working with sound code. Searching for and discovering sounds that fit with my game was another challenge as well.</li></ol></li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff8/ff8d273f4de80618ac0ca1425ff79ef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zayzizzurp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
