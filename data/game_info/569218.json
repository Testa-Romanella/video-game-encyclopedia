{"id": 569218, "slug": "lodestone", "name": "Lodestone", "name_original": "Lodestone", "description": "<p>Welcome to Lodestone - a retro roguelike, in which you must search for treasures and then get the hell out of dodge! Or just explore the world and jam out to the atmospheric tunes.</p>\n<p>The monsters are fierce!\u00a0There are attack and health\u00a0upgrades too, but time is what counts. Use your compass to find the treasure, then claim it and try to return home before the dungeon is filled with demons.</p>\n<p>Art is made by IKnowKingRabbit.</p>\n<p>The current version is technically finished, but I might return to add more features. It's a small-scope game - though it still has some fun to offer. Like enemies fighting each-other being one of the best strategies.</p>\n<p>Instructions in-game, but controls are WASD and number keys. Options can be brought up by pressing <esc>, <o>, <p> or <space> in-game.</space></p></o></esc></p><p>Oh, you're still here? While the game is a thing on its own, it's inspired by and named after TangoTek's Hermitcraft minigame \"Decked Out\". It was made in two days. I hope you'll have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T04:53:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b66/b66c677e2703f097889458603c6c0346.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thingonitsown"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
