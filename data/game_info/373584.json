This allows you to go back in case you got into a mess going forward.<br/><br/><strong>How to play:</strong><br/><br/>You simply need the mouse to play, with the mouse you will move through the menus and play. The address you click on will be the direction the frog will go.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T03:16:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5f/b5f2abfee7a258e0354f3d57576af7a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dexion Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dexion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
