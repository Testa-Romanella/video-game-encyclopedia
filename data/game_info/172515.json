To swap lanes, you must have already collected that colour previously. Beware - the grey pickups will void you of all additional colours you have! Picking up additional colours will earn you a multiplyer to your final score.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>use space bar to jump</strong></p>\n<p><strong>left + right arrow keys OR A + D keys to move left and right.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is still work in progress so feedback is welcomed. <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game was made within the two weeks of #RainbowJam17.
