We started with simple level generation and developed an AI to traverse the level. We then added objectives and finally art to the game.</p>\r\nGoing Forward\r\n<p>We plan to implement more polish to the game, continuing to fix bugs, and improve on gameplay by speeding it up. We also plan to add more character animations.</p>\r\nResearch\r\n<p>Our research involved playing games like Overcooked and other couch cooperative games to see what's fun. We also looked at lots of reference for the art in the game, which is almost entirely original work by Jim Arnett and Tylor Hawkins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-06T03:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83a/83a4a9ad15b6768baea42a3909bfb632.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kowabunga98"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
