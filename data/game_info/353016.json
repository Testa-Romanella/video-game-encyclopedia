{"id": 353016, "slug": "din-in-the-seventeenth-minute", "name": "Din in the Seventeenth Minute", "name_original": "Din in the Seventeenth Minute", "description": "<p><em>Latest Update: July 24, 2019 \u2014 version 1.0</em></p>\n<p> <strong>Din in the Seventeenth Minute</strong> is my entry for the Nouvim 3000 interactive fiction jam. The requirements were to make a short interactive story within a month, from 500 to 3,000 words, without the use of audio or extraneous imagery. The given theme was <em>Infamy</em>. While the original jam is intended for French works, I decided to submit this English language work anyway. I had worked on a French translation, but unfortunately was not able to finish it in time. Perhaps at a later date, it will be released.</p>\n<p>I interpreted the theme of <em>Infamy</em> not as about an individual person, infamous for his or her deeds, but rather as a concept, infamous for its latent existence within all of us. Beyond that, there isn't much I wish to say about the story itself\u2014reading it should convey everything I wished to present.</p>\n<p>While this is a work by 3 Halves Games, it was created solely by the developer and writer, M.H. Abdul-Rahim. However, this story does related to a previous 3HG work: it is the prequel to our 3D exploration game, EXTRA PLANETARY.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to follow us on social media and join our Discord server.
