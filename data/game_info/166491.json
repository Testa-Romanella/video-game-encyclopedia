As you try to escape room after room you have to open chests, pick up keys, find power-ups, and collect coins. Avoid barrels full of toxic fluid and the malicious AI. When you are able to get out of the last room alive, you win! If you find secret rooms, find all coins and get away without a scratch, you get the highest rating and beat the robots in style.</p>\n<p>Unlock 6 different images as your crosshair, replay a level to get a top rating and maybe you can find the secret place to get the hidden treasure. A Tutorial and two interesting levels are available from the start.\u00a0 But thats not the end, a complex level editor is already available so you can build your own crazy maze!</p>\n<p>-------<br/></p>\n\n<p>6 month ago I started my small game project at Evil Grog Games. Today I am finally ready to release a first version of 'Mazecape'.\u00a0 I'm looking for honest feedback, the entire project is built from scratch with things I've learned or figured out during the last 6 months.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa2cefb76e15cde20ece6f88cebf3500.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Evil Grog Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
