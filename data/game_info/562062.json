My teacher brought me up to the front of the room. <br/></p>\n<p>He asked me \"What do you know about teamwork?\" <br/></p>\n<p>At the time I did not know what he was talking about so I just Stated \"I'm sorry sir but I do not know.\" <br/></p>\n<p>He then took a pencil, held it out and snapped it in half in front of me. He asked me again, \"What do you know about teamwork?\"</p>\n<p>I still had no idea what he was saying so I replied \"I'm sorry but I do not understand.\"</p>\n<p>He then took 2 pencils, and with a little more effort snapped them in half right in my face and asked me for a 3rd time \"What do you know about teamwork?\"</p>\n<p>I just stood there dazed and confused. I did not know what to think. <br/></p>\n<p>Then without me saying a word he snapped 3 pencils and the same time in front me and asked again a bit louder \"What do you know about teamwork?!\" <br/></p>\n<p>This went on for a while, until he finally got to 12 pencils, but no matter how much he struggled he could not break 12.</p>\n<p>And that is when I knew what he meant.</p>\n<p>That day changed me forever and I still think about it everyday.</p>\n\n\n<p>Seriously though this game took me forever. It is the most effort I ever put into a game and it isn't even that good, but I had fun making it so I hope you have fun playing/experiencing it.<br/></p>\n<p>I love constructive criticism so please leave some in the comments if you have any.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T09:00:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/048/048642576d83d7025067194ac5acd8df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["melonllama"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
