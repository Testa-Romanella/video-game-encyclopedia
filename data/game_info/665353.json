Defend your princess by attacking other players, or even carry your princess away!</p>\n<p>README NOTE</p>\n<p>Crown Rush is a game I began developing around the beginning of 2021, making small progress around the start of February. The purpose of for this game's development was for me to practice what I had learnt from a online multiplayer tutorial I had finished watching during this year. I had also used this project to practice using Razer's 'UnityNativeChromaSDK' tools, since I've always wanted to know how to add Razer Chroma effects to my games, I'm a big Razer fan!</p>\n<p>This game can be good fun to play with friends! This is my first ever online multiplayer game I've developed and I'm sure I'll make much better online multiplayer games over the years to come!</p>\n<p>The only scrapped feature I can remember was that there were meant to be weapons that could be collected, while a spear and sword was partially complete in the end, the whole tool system was being very glitchy (Clients seeing items facing the wrong way on their screens, so on.) While the weapons were scrapped out, the apples stayed since it wouldn't be as noticable that its sprites might be flipped on another player's screen.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>Walk - Left/Right arrows</p>\n<p>Jump - X/Up arrow</p>\n<p>Attack or use item - Z</p>\n<p>Drop item or princess - C</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T05:45:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c65/c65878310ead140665f5b1841096642b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vlcenza"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
