You try to connect the green squares together. There are blocks to help you and some power ups (though they may hurt, more than they help) to assist in cleaning up blocks or other power ups. The game modes time attack and survival, the blocks are randomly generated so each play through will be totally different. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6b/e6b604596d419a8e88d87648b66d97f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Harames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
