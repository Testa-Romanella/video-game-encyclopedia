But hey, thanks for passing by.\r\nBattle (with) Dice\r\nMade for the GMTK 2022\r\n<p><strong>Concept :</strong></p>\n<p>In France, it's common to have play the card game \"Battle\", usually with an old person, usually one of your grand parents. This project take inspiration of this game (in the \"open\" version) with a twist : each card has a dice value, and when 2 cards \"battle\" each other, a dice is throwed, and the winner gets the cards. Points are counted in the end.</p>\n<p>NB : Usually, a tie (in the original, 2 same cards, here, two equal dice score) are managed differently, but I could't manage to do it in time, only had half the time to do the Jam.</p>\n<p>Dedicated to all the gramps and granies who played cards with their grand-child during a hot summer afternoon.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T15:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/654/654fe7001bd67e62ff2a252b416c2d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Captain Nakou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
