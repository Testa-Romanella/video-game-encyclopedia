{"id": 672309, "slug": "heavy-steel-demo", "name": "Heavy Steel Demo", "name_original": "Heavy Steel Demo", "description": "<p>Mecha game inspired by armored core games made for a 32 bit jam. Also submitted to mechjam 2 but receieved permission from host to work on it only during 32 bit jam as that is also 2 weeks long and starts earlier than mechjam 2. Don't expect to rank decently, yet alone win either jam, but its been a fun learning experience. Sorry didn't have time to add sound, most likely won't continue work on project. I'm not as good with making 3D art assets as a I am with 2D art assets and this is my first time trying to make a 32 bit aesthetic. If you got any tips or pointers go ahead! Also sorry, there seems to be a weird quirk where if you relaunch the game after exiting it it messes up the resolution/fullscreen mode. I'm not too familiar with making UE4 run in a different aspect ratio and resolution. Controls in game main menu.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:35:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c2/4c2df3393b544f1f82a7d492112170a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["crazy4videogames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
