You collapse the superposition of the puzzles by choosing each square's value from the available possibilities. Sudoku rules still apply though and careless collapsing will fail the puzzle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Currently one puzzle per day. More to come later, including an actual art style instead of just cribbing from Martin Donald.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T18:47:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4eff7e75875965b7c164cb3bd66f664a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VengantMjolnir"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
