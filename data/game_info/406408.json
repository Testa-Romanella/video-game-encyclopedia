LOL. WOWIE<br/><br/><strong>Brief intro</strong>: This game was meant to be happy, about Balloons, children,\u00a0 clown. But while its development, the game took a drastic turn and became a Horror Game instead. The clowns can come from no where, sometimes even at your face. But keep your heart rate steady and keep your pace going. Look ahead and calculate your path to collect each balloon before any clowns catch you stealing something that is keeping them her in this forest.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong>: WASD to move</p><p><strong>Goal:\u00a0</strong> Collect\u00a0 all the balloons and stay away from the Clowns spawning.<br/></p><p><strong>Dev's feel:\u00a0</strong> Hello everyone, this actually is my first game. and i did not know much stuff like advance stuff, but with the basics of Unity and coding (I am good at it) I made this. I expected to do a lot more, but I took about a day to prepare this. I\u00a0wasted my time with other stuffs. Should have invested more time into this.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Try the game out. It was fun making games. And even the community is so supportive, so I'll be here create many more games. Thank you all for coming her and trying out my game.</p><p>Thank you,<br/>Kshitij</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T03:23:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d0723a0177abc359c7aa3b7bbda856.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["KXTZ"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
