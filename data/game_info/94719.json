Fixes a few crashes and sound problems on Windows.</em></p>\n<p><strong>RogueSweeper</strong> is a mashup between a <strong>roguelike</strong> and a <strong>minesweeper</strong> game. Tap to reveal tiles, monsters, traps or items. Tap (or click) your way to the bottom of the infinite dungeon. How far can you go?</p>\n<p>The game has a level scaling system that requires you to manage your XP. Will you buy that health potion and lose your current level or will you risk tapping on that monster? </p>\n<p>Stats (Str and Evasion) scale with your level. Note that you can lose your current level by spending XP in the shop. Combat happens by tapping on an enemy. Destroying a monster will award you with food and maybe a free item!<br/> </p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>5 items that can heal, feed, reveal the map and enemies and increase your stats, </li><li>8 enemies</li><li>In-Game shop that allows you to buy items with your XP</li><li>Generated dungeons with items, monsters and traps</li><li>No end in sight! Delve deeper and deeper</li><li>Available for Windows and Android</li></ul>\n<p>Want the source code? It's on github (MIT licensed). Want more info on the game, rules, items and enemies? <strong>Download the manual. It's free.</strong> Want to check out what games I've worked on before? Check out the portfolio on my website. </p>\n<p>I initially made the game during Global Game Jam 2015. This is the post-jam version. I priced it at 1.30\u20ac, which is how much a beer costs in my country. So buy me a beer and play my take on a casual roguelike.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/583/583bf272075dc9d5f72b782209dc5087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 169, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Bacioiu Ciprian"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
