This is the game about exploring \u2013 because first of all, you have to understand the rules of this world, and only then you can organize life well.</p><p>You will make tries and make mistakes, and through that you will understand the rules. Be ready to make a few of tries. But most of the rules are quite easy to understand, for example \u2013 it hard to catch fish from the hill, people do not work without home, children don't get born on the streets, etc.</p><p>Right now, the project is only a prototype, does not have a whole lot of content in it and does not have a clear goal in it. But, if you will like the mechanics \u2013 I will keep on working on exploring part in the game.</p><p>My plans are:</p><ul><li>Technology</li><li>Religion</li><li>Trade</li><li>More interactivity</li><li>More locations</li><li>Leveling</li><li>Etc.</li></ul><p>P.S.
