More than <strong>70 animals</strong> in different categories like <strong>farm</strong> animals, <strong>insects</strong>, <strong>birds</strong>, <strong>wild</strong> and <strong>sea</strong> animals and more!<br/><br/>The game is presented by <strong>Teo</strong>, a cute pig that will guide your child in the game. In the practice mode, your little one can practice the animal names by swiping through the different categories. When an animal is touched, Teo will tell the name of the animal.<br/><br/>In the Play mode, Teo will show different animals to the child and will ask him or her to point at one. With this simple exercise, the kid will soon learn how to differenciate between animals and will be able to recognize them.<br/><br/>Animal Names uses cute cartoon animals pictures to make the learning process more fun!<br/><br/>The game also lets you switch between English and Spanish, so your kid can learn animal names in a different language too!<br/><br/>Join Teo in this learning adventure and make your child's time in your device more productive!<br/><br/>Animal Names is recommended for children between 18 months and 4 years.</p><p><strong>A\u00a0thought on pricing</strong></p><p>The game is <strong>free</strong> for PC but donations are highly appreciated so we can continue building more games. The mobile version is just $2, less than the cost of a cup of coffee! We've decided not to put ads on the game and make monetization straighforward. You pay directly for the value that this digital product is providing you in recognition of the\u00a0hard work of an entire team (audio, illustration, programming and animation).\u00a0</p><p>Relying on ads for monetization is a common practice but is often unfair for the great majority of small and indie developers than never see a return of their work, so we hope you understand this, not just for this game, but for all digital products in general. Most work is paid directly, it's only fair and natural, so why games and apps should be any different, having to rely on attracting huge numbers of users (which is very costly) to see any kind of income?</p><p>Thanks for your support, we hope you and your little one enjoy this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T12:30:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f0/6f04c2c911f55923b92a21b4069c0c94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["TuanisApps"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
