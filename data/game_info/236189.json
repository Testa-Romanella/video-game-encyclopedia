Touching a group of 3 or more blocks of the same color, the whole group disappears in a collapse and any blocks stacked above fall down to fill in the empty spaces. Clearing a complete column will cause the other blocks to slide into the center of the board.<br/><br/>If one or more blocks rise beyond the top row of the board, the game is lost. If the player manages to survive a specified number of lines without losing, they win the level and are awarded bonus points for each empty space. Higher points are awarded for spaces at the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>A level usually begins with a few rows of blocks using a starting set of colors. One after the other, new blocks are added to a \"feed\" row below the board. When the feeder row has filled, all of its blocks are moved up, to the active board, shifting the field of remaining blocks higher. As the levels get harder, the rate of new blocks entering the feed increases. New colors are also be introduced, making it more challenging for the player to find groups that are large enough to be collapsed.<br/><br/>There are a number of power ups that randomly appear to help the player.<br/>\u2606 Bomb; clears a 3x3 block of gems<br/>\u2606 Stop Watch; slows down the feeding of new blocks.<br/>\u2606 Lightning Bolt; freezes the feeder, stopping new blocks from entering the feeder.<br/>\u2606 Color Destroyer; destroys all blocks on the active board that match its colour.<br/>\u2606 Horizontal Destroyer; destroys all blocks in the same horizontal line.<br/>\u2606 Nuke; completely clears the board of all blocks.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/87f/87f876cd5e8489d67ff16b9979db693c.jpg", "website": "http://meyume.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Meyume"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["MEYUME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
