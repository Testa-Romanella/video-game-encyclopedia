Two identical graphics form a pair.</p>\n<p>Click on any two cards to reveal those cards and find the pairs. If a pair is found, it will be removed from the screen.</p>\n<p>If the revealed cards do not match, they are turned face down again. When all pairs are found, the timer stops and the game is over.</p>\n<p>You can choose between 3 game levels:</p>\n<p>16/8 which means</p>\n<p>16 cards with a total of 8 pairs</p>\n<p>20/10 which means</p>\n<p>20 cards with a total of 10 pairs</p>\n<p>24/12 which means</p>\n<p>24 cards with a total of 12 pairs</p>\n<p>Because the graphic pairs look very similar,\u00a0</p>\n<p>your memory will be challenged.</p>\n<p>So concentrate, choose your level and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T16:54:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9d/a9d59673637c50d5ddafc1b8f0416cf9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["designpeter"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
