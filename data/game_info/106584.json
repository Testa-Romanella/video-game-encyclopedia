Then I discovered that Ludum Dare 33 was running and I developed into a full game. It took one weekend, fueled by peppermint tea and a nasty cold.</p> <p>You are a skeleton in a dungeon. But something is wrong.... Why are the walls breaking down around you? Who are these green skeletons that hunt you? Survive and escape.</p><strong>Controls</strong><br/><p>Move with WASD and mouse, standard FPS controls.<br/>Use Left Mouse Button or Left CTRL to open doors.<br/>Left Shift to sprint.
