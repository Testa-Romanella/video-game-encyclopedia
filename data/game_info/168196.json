It's a basic clicker game... Um.. usually I have more to say about my games, but, once again, its very basic, but the game play is solid (at least I like to think). So yeah. In terms my personal development habits (like you would like to know), I am trying to work on a regular basis. But once again, definitely expect more from me in the future.</p><p>Until then,</p><p>RickyDiculous</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f3/0f3e8195f636c4e6b62c71467d998d22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RickyDiculous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
