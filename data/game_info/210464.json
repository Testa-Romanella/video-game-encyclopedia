I had an MVP ready on that day so I decided to publish the MVP as of right now I am continuing development until there is nowhere left to go with it. I'm planing on making a story-line as to why you are running and jumping, and running some more. For now there is only one level which is meant to be used to test the physics, let you notice anything weird about the physics let me know. The graphics will be improved on in a later update.</p>\n<p>Here are some answers to some questions you may have:</p>\n<p>Q: Why should I pay the minimum price of $0.10?</p>\n<p>A: To support the developer and receive early access and possibly more benefits\u00a0to come.</p>\n<p>Q: If I make a suggestion, will it \u00a0get implemented?</p>\n<p>A: Most likely, yes. As long as it makes sense to be in the game and is not absurd.</p>\n<p>Q: Where is the website for this game?</p>\n<p>A: On the way. Hopefully it will be ready by November of 2017.</p>\n<p>Q: Will there be multiplayer support?</p>\n<p>A: If my team comes on-board with this game possibly.</p>\n<p>Q: Will there be DLC?</p>\n<p>A: Possibly if there is it will cost $0.25 each at the most.</p>\n<p>If you still have questions email me here: lolk4552@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/55f/55fb4d0f08f8aff044d3f04eabb8ff4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GearClash"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
