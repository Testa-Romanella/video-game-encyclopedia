You control a nimble druid that can levitate and cast powerful magic spells. The action is fast and smooth, and the enemies are numerous and relentless.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEach island is a unique and complex 3d sculpture brimming with monsters, temples, forests, mountains, caves and bosses. Massive cliffs rise from the depths. Insane, twisted passages wind their way through valleys and under mountains. No two islands are ever the same as the game challenge evolves around your play style, offering a truly unique experience tailored to you!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe islands are infested with a demonic horde. Spinefish lurk in the watery depths, skeletons march across the hillsides, vile shaman screech and fly overhead, vicious Hell-bats spit fireballs that erupt and ignite the canopy. Nowhere is safe, especially after dark when Ghastly apparitions descend from the stars and  inexorably hunt you down.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGather resources as you enhance your spell book with a range of powerful spells that gives you the edge as you strive to survive. Use Spark Shot to mine blocks from the earth, or get up close and unleash a massive electric Zap; instantly reducing small foes to a smoking heap. If things get out of control, summon a Swarm of wasps to take the heat or protect yourself with a sentient Bolt that defends you against sneak attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCan you find your way through the archipelago of islands for the final showdown with the Lords Of Torment?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDeveloped by Kiaran Ritchie of Bioware, in association with Jane Whittaker (5 time programmer of the year award winner, author of Alien Vs Predator for the Atari Jaguar et al) and the incredibly talented Keystone team, Rogue Islands takes procedural landscape games to dizzying new heights.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Rogue Islands, the new game from the mind behind Goldeneye could be the sleeper hit of 2017\" - Jordan King, TrustedReviews.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Very detailed randomly generated landscapes, combined with fantastic combat and resource gathering. The gameplay is really well thought out and won't leave you bored.
