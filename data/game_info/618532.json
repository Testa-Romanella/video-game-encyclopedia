Thanks to your help.\u00a0\u00a0 We are just kinda out of maintenance these days.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, I'll go green.\r\n- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and those nonbinary people and non-people!\u00a0\u00a0 This is P, your beloved DJ for the COVRADIO tonight.\u00a0\u00a0 We shall answer the first hotline after a pleasing music...\r\n- Hello? This is COVRADIO, your nightkeeper.<br/>- ...<br/>- Are you still there? Can you hear me?<br/>- Oh, sure, thank God! Can we hold on a bit longer?\u00a0\u00a0 Please... I haven't been talking to someone for so long...\r\n\n<p>During the pandemic era, people have been taken apart. Love ones\u00a0separated; close friend hospitalized; parties no long held... but still,\u00a0we have COVRADIOconnected us together.</p>\n<p>Feel lonely and just want to talk? Just call the COVRADIO.</p>\n<p>Feel anxious and don't know what to do? Just call the COVRADIO.</p>\n<ul><li>You, as the radio DJ, will have to decide what to broadcast.It can be either some tranquil music, some exotic ads, or calls\u00a0from your loyal audience.</li><li>You need to keep an eye on the audience. If you lose them, you\u00a0lose the game.\u00a0</li><li>You should also take care of the budget. We don't\u00a0do charity at the broadcasting company.</li><li>Music can draw some audience, whilst ads will make the audience\u00a0leave. And calls? They are just myth depending on your response.\u00a0People react to your answers as you react to theirs. That is how\u00a0the myth is called.</li></ul>\n<p>But anyway, do remember, take good care of yourself in the pandemic:\u00a0wear a mask, wash your hands, and keep social distancing!</p><p>Controls:</p><ul><li>Mouse</li></ul><p>Made by: Lynn Wang &amp; Jarry Shaw</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:04:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/731885e7a9cfc34d789d56b00e90f5eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["somecat1996"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
