It's divided in \"waves\", which have five levels each. The player can get to the next level by shooting a certain amount of aliens, which increases with every wave. When the next wave is reached, the game speed resets.\u00a0There are two types of enemies: the red alien (which is beaten if shot once)\u00a0 and\u00a0the green alien (which is beaten if shot twice). If an enemy hits the player, one of the four \"beam generators\" is lost. If all beam generators are lost, it's game over!</p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>A (Z on the keyboard) - start/pause/turn music on and off</p>\n<p>D-pad/arrow keys - shoot beam/switch between menu options</p>\n<p>----------</p>\n<p>Additional graphical effects:</p>\n<p>Pixelbath</p>\n<p>Kyuchumimo</p>\n<p>Daves84</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T00:05:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/451/451ae1ccf99f3713617c1251b662ac54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mega Sparkmaster"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
