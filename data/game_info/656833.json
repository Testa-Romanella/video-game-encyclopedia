The goal of the game is to max out one of the four main stats. Pretty simple, but there is a twist. There is a fifth stat that makes a game more chaotic if not managed properly. Since it's a Game Jam game it might seem a bit unbalanced, but I\u00a0hope you will enjoy it anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T00:42:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e3/3e3072dca546040cf0693b776b5d5ee5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zentaya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
