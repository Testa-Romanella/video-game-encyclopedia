Granny\u2019s Bathhouse is the place to be this spring, and people have flocked in droves!\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Granny, your job is to keep your customers\u2019 bath temperature just right. If a customer gets too hot or too cold, they\u2019ll get angry and leave!\u00a0</p>\n<p>First things first, fill the tubs, and then greet the customers. Once greeted, the customer will get into an unoccupied tub if one is available. Don\u2019t leave a customer waiting too long though, or they\u2019ll get impatient and eventually storm out, hurting your reputation!\u00a0</p>\n<p>To ensure your customers are kept comfortable during their soak, burn logs in the furnace to heat up their water, or if the customer is too hot, douse the tub with a bucket of ice cold water to cool them down. Don\u2019t forget to empty and refill the bath after a customer is finished! No one wants to bathe in dirty water!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note: Between you and me, Granny isn\u2019t as active as she used to be; she can\u2019t carry her bucket and logs at the same time anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Art:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>DanEmWah</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong></p>\n<p>Kaleidoscope by e s c p https://escp-music.bandcamp.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music promoted by https://www.free-stock-music.com/\u00a0</p>\n<p>Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>\n<p>Sugarpunch DEMO by Pizzadude</p>\n<p>Dinkebilo by Adevio Studio\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T04:25:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e21f784ab3d64a1a6fd848b44e56fffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Babilisto"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
