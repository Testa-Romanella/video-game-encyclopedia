Instructions in-game.</p>\n<p>Other things worth noting:</p>\n<p>- Feeling a bit cramped huddled around the keyboard?\u00a0Plug in some controllers!</p>\n<p>- As well as causing you to respawn, spikes will chop 1 off your score in Clash, cause you to drop all of your coins in Coin Hunt - and function as an instant death in Survival!</p>\n<p>- You can 'super bounce' if you press the corresponding key / button exactly as your square touches a bounce pad. You'll jump twice as high!</p>\n<p>- Among the stages you can select is a 'random stage generator.' So, there you go, practically infinite stages to choose from.</p>\n<p>- The game keeps track of individual player wins / losses unless you back-out to the select players screen, or, you know, quit.</p>\n<p>Graphics, music, design and programming by Tom Cheshire.</p>\n<p>(Download version is identical to the browser version, with the addition of controller vibration)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0eb9dc9d72e414854c9a9de3f771a4d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tomcheshire"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
