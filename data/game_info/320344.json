This single fact has acted the primary inspiration for Nindendy&#39;s new Triple-A HitGame &quot;Elizabeth Crypt Girl: The Game That Plays You&quot;.<br />\nA reflecting pool of the futility we all experience, &quot;Crypt Game Desire&quot; is the only game that painstakingly replicates the banal conditions which define all our lives. You will collect gold, only to forget what point there is in collecting gold. You will grind against the walls of the crypts, yearning for any sensation in this lonely hellworld. You will laugh- and then realize there is nothing to laugh about- and then cry. Then you will cry even more. After several hours of this your tears will flood the room and you will suffocate as a result of your own realizations into the true nature of waking life.<br />\nEnter Crypt World- the knife which will cut through the thin veil which obscures the infinite nothingness contained within our lives. Nothing will survive beyond this point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-02T18:56:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9f6/9f6f09553793c3a60570c1d278fd724c.jpg", "website": "http://cicadamarionette.com/Games/CryptWorlds/Main.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lilith Zone"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
