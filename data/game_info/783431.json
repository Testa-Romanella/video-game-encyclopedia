Join him for a thrilling ride down an Alabama Dirt Road.</p>\n<p>As the great philosopher Willy Wonka once said: \"So much time and so little to do. Wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it.\"\r\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it's time to get someone else's eyeballs on this. The place is a mess, there's salad forks mixed with the table forks.\u00a0Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!\r\n</p>\n<p>This is still VERY alpha but all of the main systems, physics and processes should be bug-free (ha ha, I crack myself up). Scores, Settings and Challenges all need to be added. passenger bonuses only apply for Alex, Maple and Zack.\u00a0The roads are just placeholders and the obstacles are largely just scattered about. Even if you lose all your health you won't die, and passengers are all unlocked (don't get too used to that).\u00a0\u00a0If you do spot what you think is a legit bug I'd appreciate at much info as you can give, what happened, what was the game doing at the time, etc..\r\n</p>\n<p>Thanks for visiting.\u00a0Please pardon the mess.. and do not look under the rug!\r\n</p>\n<p>John\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f2/2f2257ef138ab2c4c5149a022232ddca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Just4FunStudios"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
