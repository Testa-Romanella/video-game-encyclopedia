A little too fresh maybe. Will Grandma be able to chop you? Will you be in the soup, or will you make it out of her kitchen in one piece?</p>\n<p>Borscht is a fast-paced local multiplayer racing game for 1-4 players. You are all veggies trying to escape from Grandma's knives and getting into the soup. You can only count on yourselves, however, because Grandma will surely not let more than one veggie escape. Making sure others fall victim to her might give you some advantage.<br/></p>\n<p>Notes:\r\n</p>\n<p>Menu is incomplete, the game will start with 4 players, one can play with WASD and Space on the Keyboard, one with Arrows and Shift on the Keyboard, and 2 players with controller.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls:\r\n</p>\n<p>1.
