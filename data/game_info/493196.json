Sadly we didn't have enough time for that or the credits. There is how ever 4 Easter eggs though can you find them all? \u00a0 We are willing to continue to work on this game, but only if people seem to like and enjoy this for we are college students at the moment and this does take a lot of our time. \u00a0Well we hope you enjoy the Under Lizard it was a blast to make and very stressful.... We also plan on improving the graphics and colors or leave them the same depending on what people like! As well as changing some of the taming mechanics to make it more of a hands on way to tame then RNG. \u00a0Please feel free to ask any questions about the game in the comments or if you would like a tutorial series on how to make a game like this for yourself! I have a Youtube and twitch AnimalRacer3 where I play games with my friends including Justin who is IceBox1000 on twitch. So if you guys want me to make a tutorial on it let me know and follow so that you can be notified when I make it... Yes I plugged myself and my friend....</p>\n<p>UnderLizard V0.1 is the Gameboy jam version.<br/>UnderLizard V0.2 has the the bug fixes and credits Sadly was an hour too late for it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29d/29daaa5de75e0a4a67312357503de56e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AnimalRacer3"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
