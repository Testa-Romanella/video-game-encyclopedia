Over the course of the game you will find yourself dodging more and more obstacles spat out from the spinning void at the centre of the map. But be careful, asteroids from the corners of space will make your life hard. Use the backwards turret to shoot asteroids and the forward gun to shoot black hole debris.<br/><br/>PULSOR, although simplistic, you may find is quite addictive, once you get the hang of the rotation controls you will be chasing that next high score in no time.<br/><br/><strong>Game Play</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow Keys to move</li><li>Space to shoot</li><li>Collect HP and Gold to spend in store</li><li>Beat your old point/time High Score !</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Dev's Notes</strong><br/><br/>Hey, my name is Dylan Robertson and PULSOR is my first release to hit Steam !
