In these apocalyptic circumstances, what gets you through is\u00a0<strong>merit</strong>\u00a0- what entitles you to rations or whatever few luxuries a life in this time can offer. With social order dismantled, some people will do whatever they can to stay afloat in this tragic land.\r\n</p>\n<p>One such example would be you, a\u00a0<strong>crooked doctor</strong>. Earning as much\u00a0<strong>merit</strong>\u00a0as possible from saving people, by supplying them with body parts they need, which come rarely and randomly from a magic box, whilst ignoring standard medical protocol, such as the Hippocratic Oath. There are two main sets of military personnel:\u00a0<strong>Sparrows (white die)</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Eagles (gold die)</strong>. With the\u00a0<strong>merit</strong>\u00a0earned from the latter being\u00a0<strong>tenfold</strong>\u00a0as the former, clear priority is to be shown to attend to these superior officers.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, not only can you merely prioritise important patients, more obsolete patients can be \u201c<strong>sliced and diced</strong>\u201d, where they are\u00a0<em>carefully\u00a0</em><strong>sliced\u00a0</strong>open and a\u00a0<strong>body part</strong>\u00a0is given out on the\u00a0<strong>\u201cROLL OF THE DICE</strong>\u201d.\r\n</p>\n<p>Upon either\u00a0<strong>being killed</strong>\u00a0or\u00a0<strong>dying naturally</strong>,\u00a0<strong>dead bodies</strong>\u00a0emit fumes that\u00a0<strong>continually lower your merit\u00a0</strong>until disposed of.\u00a0 Due to low surveillance, the\u00a0<strong>merit lost</strong>\u00a0from a soldier\u00a0<strong>being killed</strong>\u00a0and<strong>\u00a0dying naturally</strong>\u00a0is the\u00a0<strong>same</strong>. Try your best to keep your\u00a0<strong>merit</strong>\u00a0above\u00a0<strong>0</strong>\u00a0for as long as possible, whilst the chaos around you becomes more and more extreme as time rolls its tanks.\r\n</p>\n<p>---\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Nelson\u00a0Gong (@dumplingdrinker) - Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Luke Gahng-Guzen (@elementary_luke)\u00a0- Programmer\r\n</p>\n<p>Jonathan Martin (@axal_art)\u00a0- Artist\r\n</p>\n<p>Winnie (@thuswinnie)- Musician\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T11:17:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/445/44570f3cef063a5115eb83d2c12f5a4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Resurge Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
