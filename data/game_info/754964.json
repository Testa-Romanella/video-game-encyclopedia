{"id": 754964, "slug": "hypermind", "name": "Hypermind", "name_original": "Hypermind", "description": "Hypermind is a combination-based first-person puzzle game. We have designed four abilities: Apply Velocity, Lock, Enlarge, and Anti-gravity. This allows players to make full use of their imagination to discover more possibilities for solving puzzles.<h3>Velocity</h3>To remotely move Cubes or press controllers by applying a velocity to the target.<br/><br/><h3>Lock</h3>To fix the Cube in a certain position or to keep the controller pressed/released.<br/><br/><h3>Enlarge</h3>To double the size and mass of a Cube.<br/><br/><h3>Anti-gravity</h3>To reverse the direction of gravity of the Cube.<br/><br/><h3>Advanced Lock</h3>To lock the status of a Cube, so the player may cast Enlarge/Anti-gravity on another Cube.<br/><br/><h3>Combinations of Abilities</h3>You can combine the Abilities in any way you want, thus allowing various approaches to solving the puzzles.<br/><br/><h3>Self-casting</h3>Most Abilities can be used on yourself. You can move, lock, enlarge yourself like you do a cube.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T04:01:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f98/f980d838951948703300f91758a83579.jpg", "website": "https://www.indiedb.com/games/hypermind", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Recursionstudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Recursionstudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
