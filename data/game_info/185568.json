The game focuses on driving skill, entertaining physics, interesting maps, and car handling. The game takes inspiration from rock crawling, however does not attempt to be realistic.</p>\n<p><strong>Early Alpha Notice:</strong><br/>This game is in a Prototype state. Only a limited number of players are able to play right now, if there is a huge demand you may not be able to play until a slot is opened.  Please disregard the standard assets, these are placeholders for vehicles in development. I'm working on it. There's a lot of bugs. I know about some of them but\u00a0 I would like to know if you experience something. Just post in the comments. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>What are you waiting for?
