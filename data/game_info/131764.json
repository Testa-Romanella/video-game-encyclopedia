My name is Sputnik and I'm trying to create a Game!\r\n<p><strong>A Prototype for a Game with no name... (yet)</strong></p>\n<p>This is an Action-RPG, Isometric style, \"Dungeon Crawler\" I'm working on, inspired by old school and acrade games! Focus lies on a \"faster-paced\" gameplay style with very simple mechanics, 8-Directional controls and some exploration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is, to reach the end of a Dungeon. Everything you collected (Levels, Currency, ...) are kept when you exit the Dungeon, so there is a sense of \"progression\".\u00a0 More Heroes are planned as unlockables, but for now, I focus only on one Hero.</p>\n<p>The Dungeons are handcrafted and have unique themes, but shift slighty in some or other places! Loot is randomly dropped by enemies and can be found in \"containers\". The \"Hero\" is a Character you control. He/She has a main weapon (Sword, Whip (planned), Bow (planned), ...) that cost no resource to use. The Hero can also equip a \"Subweapon\" which can be found randomly in the dungeon.\u00a0When used, it consumes the\u00a0resource \"Mana\".\u00a0 Mana can be\u00a0replenished of course!</p>\n<p>I would describe the game as <em>lighthearted-simple-fun </em>for short playsessions.</p>\n<p>Everything was created by myself (except some sound effects) and I'm working on this project alone in my freetime. Of course there is room for improvements, suggestions, tips! Nothing is set in stone yet.\u00a0Sadly I'm not a good programmer nor am I the best artist, but I try my best to make this game work!</p>\r\nA little Testvideo\r\n\r\n<p>It's in a very, very early stage and barely looks like a game. It is functional, but many main features are missing! The concept is very simple and took heavy inspiration from classic arcade style games, with fast gameplay and very simple mechanics! The textures and graphics are all barebones and\u00a0there are still many placeholder objects for enemies, objects, projectiles, that will be switched out with actual models.</p>\n<p><em>I will try to work on the game frequently and hope I can show progress sooner or later.\u00a0Hopefully, there will be a \"game\" in a not too far future!</em></p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>You can't loose: If your health drops to 0, you can play further</li><li>[WASD],[LStick] - Move the Character</li><li>[A],[LMouse],[STRG] - Attack</li><li>[B],[RMouse],[ALT] - Roll</li><li>[X],[MMouse],[SHIFT] - Subweapon (If collected)</li><li>The more Stamina (Green-Bar) is filled, the more damage you deal!</li><li>If you reach a dead end, that's it!
