Because the snake will open an infinite and straight path, and sometimes it will have to go through squares that indicate a number, that number will be subtracted from it to your serpent as it passes through it.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThese squares often can not be avoided, since there will also be obstacles and other elements that will make it impossible for you.<br/>\r\nThere is the strategy, you will have to think about the best way, although sometimes it is going through a square with a large number.<br/>\r\nThere will also be elements that will make you gain value in the snake, you will see them as out of square elements with a number, you simply have to go through them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-Second, we have the arcade and \"skill\" component since the game goes fast, and you will have to move the snake fast, otherwise you will lose very easily when hitting something you do not owe or getting into where you should not.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe style and graphics are simple, but the game is not, so if you want to have a great time playing while you face a great challenge this game is perfect for you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:50:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6b/c6b212b4072b97aaddcd3157adfe2c75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dexion Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dexion Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
