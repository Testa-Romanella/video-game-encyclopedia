Created for Ludum Dare 27!</strong></p><p>This game swaps between 4 different classic arcade inspired games every ten seconds, but keeps the same objects in play from each previous game, and changes their behaviors. You'll see what I mean!</p><p>Controls are the Arrow Keys and Space bar. The controls change depending on the game currently in play, shouldn't be too difficult to figure out :)</p><p>This Ludum Dare entry is a bit of a mess, haha. I got tired of making it half way through, so I added in funny/stupid nonsense instead of improving the actual game, but I still think it was an interesting concept at least... Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c1c/c1ca85d05255e0134bfcd99042eb9242.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BipolarDesign"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
