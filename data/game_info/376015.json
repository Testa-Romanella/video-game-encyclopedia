Try to merge it with as many cities as you can before your resources ran out!</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li><strong>\u00a0Left click: </strong>Move pieces</li><li><strong>Right click: </strong>Rotate pieces</li></ul>\n<p>Drag'n drop pieces listed on bottom to add them to your city at the center of the screen. On each turn, you an choose one piece to add. A piece have to be placed next to an occupied tile in order to be connected. You can't move once it is added.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 4 resources you have to manage. A tile produces one type of resources, but also consumes one of every others! So you have to find the right balance in order for your city to be sustainable. Also, the more your city gets bigger, the faster it will produce and consume!<br/></p>\n<p>The game stops once one of your resource drops below zero, or when you don't have room left. Try to build the biggest city before that!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><em>Merge Cities</em> has been made during the <em>Godot Wild Jam #13</em>, by T4g1, Itooh and Noragne.</p>\n<p>Font used: ChiKareGo by Giles Booth<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-20T07:30:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/16b/16ba41b1f6c84d9de57d96b812ce978a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Itooh", "T4g1"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
