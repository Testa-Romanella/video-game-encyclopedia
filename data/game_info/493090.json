This didn't work when tested by users so new version above should work now!<br/></p>\n<p>------<br/></p>\n<p>V1.1.1<br/></p>\n<p>Please use Version 1.1.1!!!!!<br/></p>\n<p>As a result of two players saying Zombies are running too fast, now changed slow speed (Press Number key \"1\" / Keypad 1) to only move at 1f speed to see if this helps, if not I'm out of ideas!</p>\n\n<p>V1.1</p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<p>1. Now Updated in response to user feedback that Zombies were too fast on his machine, added option to change speed from Normal (3) setting,\u00a0 to Medium (2),\u00a0 Slow (1) using 1,2 and 3 number or keypad keys during play, no cheating though and slowing them down when you're getting attacked en masse lol!</p>\n<p>2. Fixed score going below zero if you hadn't score anything at all.<br/></p>\n<p>3. Changed player position on restart back to original (although rotation to original 0,0,0 not fixed yet).</p>\n<p>4. Increased brightness of Player headlamp up by 50%<br/></p>\n<p>5. Added Game Quit using escape key.<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:13:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa72ac74df9c7c98f302ee60aaa997dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phil Harland"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
