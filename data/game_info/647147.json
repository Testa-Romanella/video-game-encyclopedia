Click on a gem, and all gems of the same type in the same row or column will be attracted to it, moving to get as close as possible to the gem you clicked. Any gems of other types that get in the way will be captured!</p>\n<p><strong>Game modes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Challenge Mode</strong>, you're trying to make big clusters of a single type of gem. The objective in the top-left corner will tell you what kind of gem to focus on, and how big your cluster should be. You have 10 turns to make each cluster. Casting a spell is free; it doesn't take up a turn.\r\n</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<strong>Endless Mode</strong>, you're free to click around as much as you want with no move limit. Try to make fun shapes!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Spells</strong><br/></p>\n<p>When you capture gems, you charge up corresponding\u00a0magic spells:</p>\n<ul><li>The \ud83c\udf1e<strong>Sun\ud83c\udf1e </strong>spell randomly turns some leaf gems into bloom gems.\u00a0</li><li>The \ud83c\udf19<strong>Moon\ud83c\udf19</strong>\u00a0spell randomly turns some bloom gems into leaf gems.</li><li>The \u23f3<strong>Time</strong>\u23f3 spell randomly turns some moon gems into sun gems and vice versa.</li><li>The \ud83d\udca7<strong>Water</strong>\ud83d\udca7 spell randomly moves each row one step left or right.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Known issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>The audio can be crackly in Chromium-based browsers.
