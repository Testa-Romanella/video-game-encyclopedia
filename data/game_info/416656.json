Press 'SPACE' to dump your water on the fires and extinguish them before time runs out.</p>\n<p>If you need to get there quicker, hold down 'W' for a speed boost. Your little engine can't take much though, so it will only help a bit. And make sure you stay in the fly zone, otherwise you will lose some time!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for playing our mini game! This was created a while ago for a weekend game jam, and while it isn't the greatest game ever, it is the first one we ever made and released. We are very proud of it.</p>\n<p>If you liked it, rate and comment, and please follow us on Twitter to keep up to date with our latest projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ab/2abb84d97994db79542eefb144fd99b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Deer Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
