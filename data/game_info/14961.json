Over time, no longer held stable by Abys' magic, the fortress sank into the earth, becoming a haven for foul creatures, dark magicks, and the refuse of the Over-World. The fortress, now deep beneath the earth, became known as The Catacombs, and kids from all over found themselves drawn into its shadows - seeking riches, power, knowledge, and escape. Now, coming-of-age ceremonies and criminal sentences alike all revolve around plumbing the depths of The Catacombs, and the legend of Abys has been all but forgotten. Some say she yet sleeps in the dark below, the seals that keep her contained growing ever-weaker.What Lies BeneathCatacomb Kids is a procedurally generated platformer, with an equal emphasis on quick reactions, tactical engagement, and strategic character growth. Wield swords, spears, axes, and daggers -- unleash powerful magicks to burn, freeze and poison foes with -- overcome traps and beasts both deadly and unrelenting.<br/><br/><br/>The game is streamlined but not \"simple\", featuring a system where basic elements interact to create complex outcomes and stories. Lure monsters into combat with one another or take advantage of environmental hazards to trick your foes into their own bloody demise. The world is your crafting space, allowing you to create new items and tools from within the game-space itself, never needing to farm materials or navigate a menu to demonstrate your cleverness.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e3/1e324aba3e8bbd2c24d8668b15a6315a.jpg", "website": "http://www.ckgame.net", "rating": 4.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 5, "owned": 46, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 210, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["FourbitFriday"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["FourbitFriday"], "esrb_rating": null}
