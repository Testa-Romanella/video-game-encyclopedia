{"id": 965635, "slug": "strategic-mind-spirit-of-liberty", "name": "Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty", "name_original": "Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty", "description": "<h3>A story from the legends, but in real history</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/>Winter War: over 500,000 Soviet soldiers attack Finland, a country with a population of 3,700,000, and the Finns drive them back, inflicting 5 times their own casualties. Continuation War: the Reds return with a total strength of 1,500,000 - almost half of the entire Finnish population - and the Finns stop them again. Finland\u2019s survival in these two brutal wars against an enemy so vast was a true historical miracle. A miracle of heroism and valor. A miracle of the Finnish spirit of liberty.<br/><br/><h3>Experience heroic struggle and make tough choices</h3><br/><br/>You are the commander of the scarce Finnish troops. Your only goal - to save your homeland and your people from total annihilation. Would you risk losing your experienced troops to try and capture the enemy tanks? Would you try to save the stragglers during the retreat and risk losing everyone, or cut your losses and establish a new line of defense? Would you agree to negotiate with the Soviets that had treacherously attacked you twice before?<br/><br/><h3>Play two campaigns: historical and \u201cwhat if\u201d</h3><br/><br/><strong>Historical campaign</strong><br/>Play through a number of missions throughout the 1939-1945 timeline, spanning three wars: Winter War, Continuation War, and Lapland War. The historical campaign will have smaller-scale but action-packed operations, covering all of the iconic historical battles. <br/><br/><strong>Alternate history campaign</strong><br/>Play a shorter campaign with larger operations, centered around the \u201cwhat if\u201d events. Help the Germans take Leningrad, cut off the allied aid shipments to USSR by taking the port of Murmansk - that is only the beginning.<h3>Immerse yourself into the (hi)story-driven gameplay</h3><br/><br/><strong>Primary and secondary objectives</strong><br/>Complete numerous objectives grounded in history and narrated by a number of historical characters.<br/><br/><strong>Cinematics before and after each operation</strong><br/>Watch history unfold through the eyes of the key historical figures of the time - over 60 minutes of in-game cinematics with characters such as Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Risto Heikki Ryti, and others.<h3>Create and grow the army of your own design</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Variety is the spice of war</strong><br/>The Finns had only 12 Vickers British tanks in 1939 against up to 6000 Soviet tanks. Even the odds by getting units from various other countries, and shape your rag-tag forces into a well-oiled war machine.<br/><br/><strong>Trophies for everyone!</strong><br/>Where Finnish production is struggling to catch up, make up for it by taking advanced equipment from the enemy. Turn the Soviet guns against their creators.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Faithfully recreated historical units</strong><br/>Command the Finnish ski troops and captured Soviet vehicles, including BT-7, T-34, and KV tanks. Purchase German Pz-IV tanks, StuG assault guns, and Ju-88 bombers. Make use of pre-war British Bristol Blenheim bombers, covered by Dutch Fokker and US Buffalo fighter planes.<br/><br/><strong>Upgrade your units to newer models</strong><br/>Make sure your forces are always up to date and up to the task. New models become available at historically accurate points in time.<br/><br/><h3>Train your troops and choose equipment</h3><br/><br/><strong>Gain combat experience</strong><br/>Choose various skills for your men as they gain combat experience. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Combine units from different classes</strong><br/>Compose your own force from ten classes available: Infantry, Artillery, Tanks, Reconnaissance units, Assault guns, Armored trains, Anti-tank guns, Anti-aircraft guns, Fighters, and Tactical bombers. Utilize their unique skills and equipment to maximum effect.  <br/><br/><strong>Acquire diverse equipment</strong><br/>Equip units with various special equipment, such as Machine guns, Mortars, Smoke grenades, Anti-tank rifles and Molotov cocktails, Winter equipment, and many more.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Use transport vehicles</strong><br/>In the harsh Finnish winter, speed may be the difference between life and death. Provide your units with vehicles to improve their mobility, or have your Infantry use skis to outmaneuver the enemy in winter operations.<h3>Assign historical heroes to your units</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Unique heroes system</strong><br/>Every unit in your army could meet certain high requirements to generate a historical personality - a hero with a unique set of powerful skills. <br/><br/><strong>The deadliest sniper in WW2 history - Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 - will join your troops</strong><br/>With 542 confirmed kills, and an unconfirmed total number of 705, not only was Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 the deadliest sniper of World War II, but perhaps the deadliest sniper of all time. His nickname \u201cthe White Death\u201d was well-earned.<h3>Manage your Headquarters between the operations</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Learn Headquarters skills</strong><br/>Choose in which direction your HQ staff will improve as the campaign progresses. Your decisions will result in new passive and active abilities for various units: your artillery could fire twice per turn, or you could call in the air reconnaissance to get better intel on the enemy positions.<br/><br/><strong>Get promotions and awards</strong><br/>Every operation is an opportunity to get new ranks and awards, increasing your Command points, which are used to activate your Headquarters skills and deploy more units.<br/><br/><strong>Confer with your staff</strong><br/>Consult other high-ranking officers for their opinion on the upcoming battle, and get useful advice.<h3>Use elaborate combat mechanics to overcome any foe</h3><br/><br/><strong>Manage Lethal vs Nonlethal damage</strong><br/>There are two types of damage: lethal and nonlethal. Dealing nonlethal damage to your enemies will make them surrender. Different units are prone to deal either lethal or nonlethal. <br/><br/><strong>Use terrain differences to your advantage</strong><br/>Tanks are vulnerable in difficult terrain and cities, while Infantry can occupy buildings or hide in the forests to gain large defensive bonuses. All units suffer large penalties in swamps or while crossing a river, etc. Be aware of your surroundings, and use them to your advantage.<br/><br/><strong>Take the \u201cline of sight\u201d and the \u201czone of control\u201d into consideration</strong><br/>Some terrain and buildings obstruct firing unless you are using artillery or mortars. Approaching an enemy unit up close will finish your movement, unless you are using a Recon unit.<br/><br/><strong>Activate various skills and equipment</strong><br/>Use incendiary or subcaliber shells to maximize your damage to the enemy. Order forced march in the most desperate situations. Employ aerobatics to increase your air force efficiency. Use your HQ skills to affect the entire battlefield.<br/><br/><strong>Use a complex spotting system that represents the importance of reconnaissance</strong><br/>Call upon the air and ground reconnaissance to gather intel about the enemy before ordering your troops forward. No one likes to be ambushed. <br/><br/><strong>Adapt to various battlefield conditions</strong><br/>There is a day-night cycle in the game as well as weather types such as frost or rain. All of these conditions impose penalties that must be countered with special equipment and skills. The finest of your troops may even use such conditions to their advantage. Use the cover of the night to sneak up on the enemy, or strike when the foe is freezing and immobilized.<h3>Utilize the most advanced supply and infrastructure system in the genre</h3><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Ammunition and fuel</strong><br/>All units have limited ammo and fuel. Without ammo, your units cannot fight, and without fuel, your vehicles cannot move - and any aircraft will simply crash. <br/><br/><strong>Supply hubs</strong><br/>Generate supplies and transfer them to your troops throughout an entire system, like a heart pumping blood through veins.<br/><br/><strong>Supply points </strong><br/>Connect different infrastructure facilities and redistribute supplies. Supply points also allow your troops to change special equipment and renew its charges.<br/><br/><strong>Airfield </strong><br/>Allows aircraft units to land for refueling, repairs, and refit of equipment. Damage to the airfield would also damage all landed aircraft.<br/><br/><strong>Seaport</strong><br/>Allows resupply and change of equipment for naval units. It also generates supplies, if there is a maritime hub nearby and the Seaport is not under enemy blockade.<br/><br/><strong>Damage the infrastructure</strong><br/>All infrastructure facilities can be disabled if their HP drops to 50% or lower. It will then gradually regain its HP and its functionality. Strike at the enemy facilities to prevent them from resupplying.<br/><br/><strong>Cut off the enemy supply lines</strong><br/>All infrastructure facilities are considered connected if a simple truck vehicle could move between them in one go. If you put your unit between the enemy facilities, it would create a zone of control, and prevent the enemy from transferring supplies. Leave the enemy units without much needed ammunition and fuel, then hunt them down.<br/><br/><strong>Make sure your own units are supplied</strong><br/>There is a limit to how far your supply vehicles can deliver supplies - make sure you take that into account when planning your next offensive.<h3>Welcome the successor</h3><br/><br/>Strategic Mind: Spirit of Liberty is the fifth installment in the Strategic Mind line of games, featuring Finland in its 3 wars during WW2.
