First developed for the Atari 8-bit family, versions were also released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC. Originally on diskette, a version with 12 levels instead of 30 was retitled Jumpman Jr. and released on cartridge. It was available on the Atari, C64, and ColecoVision.<br />\nThe game received very favorable reviews when it was released and was a major hit for its publisher, Automated Simulations. It was so successful that the company renamed itself Epyx, formerly their brand for action titles like Jumpman. Recreations on other platforms, and new levels for the original versions continue to appear.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/1890b76089fc24b04ca7ce2fc3299274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 6, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Wii", "Atari 8-bit", "Apple II", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Epyx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Epyx"], "esrb_rating": null}
