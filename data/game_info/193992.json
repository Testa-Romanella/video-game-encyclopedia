Create the game with the best graphics. <br/><br/>2. Create the game with the most fun gameplay. </strong><br/><br/>Literally just that. There is no big emphasis on the story, no experimentation. The Rebel is all about shooting, having fun and enjoying nice graphics. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c99/c99799271a2205d54f5d6a42d93e82f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 240, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["novucompgames"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
