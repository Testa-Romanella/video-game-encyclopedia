We were inspired by the great single-player campaigns of Metal Gear Solid, SWAT 3, Deus Ex, and Splinter Cell, and aim to bring that gameplay into a team-based multiplayer shooter. Intruder allows for stealth, teamwork, tactics and environmental interactions never before seen in a multiplayer game. Lure enemies into motion-detectors near explosive traps. Watch enemy movement through live security cameras and alert your teammates using the hand radio. Use real SWAT hand signals to communicate silently when enemies are nearby. In Intruder, amazing stories and emergent gameplay come from the players\u2019 actions to provide an experience you will never forget.Key Features<ul><li>Team-based stealth multiplayer: Guards vs. Intruders.<br/></li><li>Immersive FPS: climb, crouch, crawl, and swim through the environment.<br/></li><li>Use gadgets to trick, trap, distract and outsmart your opponents.<br/></li><li>Eavesdrop on the opposing team with spatial 3d voice chat.<br/></li><li>Use ragdoll physics to launch your foes out of windows or to play dead while the enemy walks right past you.<br/></li><li>Truly interactive buildings with working security cameras, spotlights, sliding windows, ventilation shafts, and elevators.<br/></li><li>Stealth-based missions with multiple objectives and escape routes.<br/></li><li>Powerful Unity3d level editor plugin to create your own Intruder maps and game modes<br/></li><li>Regular updates and new features based on community feedback!</li></ul>Quotes from Intruder players<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>... now on <strong>Steam!</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:40:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/726cd4aa6efa29853d986f2989f1a754.jpg", "website": "https://intruder.superbossgames.com/intruder", "rating": 4.09, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 130, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 4, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 398, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 11, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Superboss Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Superboss Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
