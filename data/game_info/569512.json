There are a total of five UFOs, however, each ufo sends a different kind of alien that has different functionalities.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this space shooter game, there are five types of aliens each alien can perform different actions in the gameplay.

Each AI has different weapons and an astronaut contains all the weapons such as Laser, Electric wave, Flamethrower, Machine gun, Sound wave, and Homing Missiles.\r\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, an astronaut can use the turbo gas which flying with turbo speed in the upward direction as compared to normal flying. When aliens shoot the player it can use the force field or shield which protects it from the aliens for some seconds. The player can switch weapons in the bottom center button which opens a weapon wheel where players can choose the weapon according to its need.\r\n</p>\n<p>In order to kill an alien player needs to use its weapons each weapon has its own qualities player can choose whatever they want.
