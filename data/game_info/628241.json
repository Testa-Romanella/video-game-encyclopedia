Your goal is to survive and escape from a labyrinth-like place in the shortest amount of time so that you can deliver a potential cure for the virus. Full of zombies, you have to maneuver around your enemies, but beware as a single slash from these creatures can reduce you into bits and scraps! Luckily, you are armed with a coil gun capable of firing small pieces of piercing metal but the limited amount will be ever decreasing in each run so use them carefully. There are also powerups, such as totems that give you the power to swing a piece of sharp metal or a force field that makes you invincible for a short period of time. Finally, achievements are fun little goals that you can achieve when you have attained a certain milestone!\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>_________________________________________Controls___________________________________________</strong></p>\n<p>Press WASD or arrows key to move</p>\n<p>Left Click to shoot bullets(If you have any ammo that is)</p>\n<p>Space bar to use machine gun (If you have the powerup</p>\n\n<p>Have Fun)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T07:10:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/0398567ef1d4fc1233c414620f98d616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cygame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
