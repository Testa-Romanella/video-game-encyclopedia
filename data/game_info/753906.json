Soon, the lights begin to shut off, and the school is beginning its nightly routine. With nowhere to go, and no one to pick you up, how are you going to make it through the night?</p>\n<p>Five Nights at BHS is a fangame inspired by the Five Nights at Freddy's games created by Scott Cawthon and my experiences in High School. Created entirely within the span of two weeks and using RPG Maker MV with a lot of plugins from very talented people in the community, I hope that it is as fun playing as it was to make it!<br/></p>\n<p>This was a small side project created while we were working on \"Food!\", our main title. That project is very close to completion, but we wanted to take a break and work on something new.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T13:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b9/8b997e856a7c9244c1b5aaf46d08bfc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AwesomeMonkeys"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
