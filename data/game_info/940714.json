{"id": 940714, "slug": "shell-jump-go", "name": "Shell Jump Go", "name_original": "Shell Jump Go", "description": "<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br/>Shell Jump Go is a game  inspired by Doodle Jump. In a similar fashion, your objective is to go  higher up through platforms (roots) as far as possible.\r\n </p>\n<p>What separates this game are the mechanics. In Shell Jump  Go, you are a bug attempting to go up through roots and operate by  shooting a bug-sized shotgun, which recoils you up with up to 2 shots  between roots. This leaves you with control of where your bug ends up  and once you fall, you have to start all over again. How high can you  go?\r\n </p>\n<p>The roots are procedurally generated as you go up with  random positioning, which provides variety to the gameplay. Further  features to enhance gameplay diversity are also planned for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>\n<p>Simply point your mouse below you and click. This will  shoot you in the opposite direction. While in the air, shoot again to go  further up and alter your course.\r\n </p>\n<p>The direction of the recoil depends on where you point with your mouse, so position your shot accordingly. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:27:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f536b8834a4fec5ee07be8444c2c1e41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["ottop"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
