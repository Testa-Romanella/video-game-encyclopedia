It's been months since I've seen your lavender dress flowing within in the orchid where we chased eachother. It was only days since you cried for help when Homoprobe attacked our gardens. I remember you slipping away from my dress. I remember you being caught. I don't remember you escaping.\"</p>\n<p>----Credits----</p>\n<p>Artists: HanProgrammer<br/>Musician and SFX Designer: Stutte<br/>Programming: RubyLunari<br/>Original Concept: Debra 'Hazumu' Cohen<br/>Level Designers: RubyLunari &amp;\u00a0Debra 'Hazumu' Cohen<br/>Character Designer: Mitchell Johnson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:54:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2c/c2c0878a0791efe7a44e2362803fa989.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RubyLunari"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
