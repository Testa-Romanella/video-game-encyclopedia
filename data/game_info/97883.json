They lived together with others who didn't have that same ability; over time, they ended up feeling uncomfortable with this fact, so it didn't really surprise anyone when, overnight, they disappeared without leaving any trace of their life there. nobody knows what happened to them once they left the golden cities, but legends say they're still lurking in the forests, avoiding everything golden out of shame, not wanting to be seen ever again. some people say they made some oath to Mother Nature. those more skeptic doubted they'd even existed... </p><p>One day, the Empress, a steely heroine admired and beloved by everyone, sent her people into a quest for making the kingdom the most beautiful place on Earth.
