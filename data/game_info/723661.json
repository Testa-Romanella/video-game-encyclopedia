Whiz through space as a vengeful Pluto, destroying everything in your orbital path in an attempt to prove your planet-hood. Get advice from your helpful friend Rosetta, but watch out for that pesky scientist who'll take you down with his science facts and tweets!\r\n</p>\n<strong>The Facts Behind the Game</strong>\n<p>In 2015, the\u00a0New Horizons space probe\u00a0became the first human-made object to visit\u00a0Pluto and its moons, and\u00a0marked the culmination of over 50 years of exploring the major planetary bodies of our solar system. In the time since\u00a0New Horizons\u00a0launched, however, scientists here on Earth have\u00a0reclassified\u00a0Pluto; by January of 2006,\u00a0they considered Pluto a\u00a0dwarf planet,\u00a0not a planet.\r\n</p>\n<p>This reclassification doesn\u2019t mean Pluto is any less interesting, though! It actually means\u00a0that Pluto and its system of moons differs from the 8 planets in our solar system in significant ways. Dwarf planets,\u00a0by definition, are celestial bodies that orbit a star that are massive enough to become rounded by their own gravity (like a planet), but are not massive enough to clear their orbital \u201cneighbourhood\u201d of smaller bodies. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Neil deGrasse Tyson, who makes an appearance in Pluto\u2019s Revenge, is a popular American astrophysicist and science communicator who has said for a long time that\u00a0Pluto was too odd to be called a planet\u00a0like the rest, but he\u00a0was only \u201ckind of\u201d involved in the official move to reclassify it.\r\n</p>\n<strong>The ROM Connection</strong>\n<p>The ROM has one of the most impressive collections of meteorites in Canada, including meteorites which started out as pieces of the Moon, and even Mars! The study of such materials,\u00a0called \u201cplanetary geology,\u201d\u00a0is a major focus of the geoscience that happens at the ROM, and it has led to important insights into the history and development of the rocky bodies in our solar system (for example,\u00a0Mars).\r\n</p>\n<strong>What's a Game Jam?</strong>\n<p>At a ROM Game Jam, teams of developers spend a weekend at the ROM learning from collections and curators\u00a0and using\u00a0those ideas to build fun games inspired by the museum. \u00a0With only two days to research and create their games, the results can be weird, wacky, and downright wonderful!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T07:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/189/189489b294bb9f4c861ee987a09e1b1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ROM Learning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
