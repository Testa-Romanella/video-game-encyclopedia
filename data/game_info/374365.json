In general, try to activate powerups on even numbered coins.</p>\n<p>Rows you pull are easier to solve than rows your opponent sends to you, and rows your opponent sends never contain powerups. Pull a bunch of rows before using your red powerup for best results.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Jose \"LadyEbony\" Garcia (Gameplay/UI/Netplay)</p>\n<p>David \"Texel\" Jones (Gameplay/Design/Network)</p>\n<p>Peacock Roy (Music)</p>\n<p>Egophiliac (Art, Animation)</p>\n<p>Voices \u00a9 UTJ/UCL</p>\n<p>LittleRobotSoundFactory (freesound.org) (Menu Sounds)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-13T08:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d269fbe69818604d3596798be3f40f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Nitori", "LadyEbony", "Peacock Roy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
