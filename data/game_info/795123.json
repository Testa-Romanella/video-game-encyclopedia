That didn't make any sense to me, light could move asymmetrically and we wouldn't know if it did. there would no way of knowing, Veritasium showed a lot of evidence to suggest that is the case. After thinking long and hard about it and building a test model, I found out how to measure light asymmetrically.</p>\n\n<p>Check out this video after you solve it:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T15:48:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d906a8d630f4347573fd9bd3c6e99bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zeinging"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
