Buy equipment \n      at the shop, team up with characters, and defeat the boss to clear a \n      scenario. Conquer all 21 scenarios from levels 1 through 5 to obtain \n      passwords. Obtain all of them to make your way to the final scenario! \n      Two players can play at the same time, which makes this game truly stand \n      out from the rest.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
