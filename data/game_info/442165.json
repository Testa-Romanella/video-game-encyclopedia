Click on adjacent/adjacent-diagonal tiles to form words, and smack enter to submit a word. Good up to words with 8 letters in them. Get the highest score you can in 3 minutes. <br/></p>\n<p>You can also share seeds with your friends, and compete to get the best score on the same board! Fancy schmancy. Click on the seed at the bottom to copy it, share it around. <br/></p>\n<p>This was more or less a passion project, because I wanted to play the game, and didn't want to look for one online. So here is one for you!<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:01:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/916/916fc8ba175640878b038833ed6343c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KitKatarine"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
