If you experience bad framerates, you can toggle the trees in the top right corner to improve performance a bit.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a concept I have been working on lately. Some feedback is greatly appreciated! I'm still thinking about balancing the end game more.\u00a0 As soon as the difference in strength of two players reaches a certain size, victory or defeat is guaranteed. I am looking for ways to keep the game element in it until the last second.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T13:47:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6fd/6fd6361e42ebaefdde65829af4db9a1c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Program Sam"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
