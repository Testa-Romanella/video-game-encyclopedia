Its fast-paced, physics-based, puzzle mechanics are engaging and easy to understand. Guide the lil' green cube to the green goal. Seems easy, right?<br/>If you bothered to read this far, please note Boxy is still a work in progress. I will be updating this game on a weekly basis. Keeping myself busy making adjustments and adding new content (such as art, music, mechanics, and levels) to keep you coming back for more. Feed back is crucial &amp; appreciated. Thank you, Chris Tharp Art. :^)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T02:38:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/244/244ff7415a3e51dbcc913aca31c04064.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ChrisTharpArt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
