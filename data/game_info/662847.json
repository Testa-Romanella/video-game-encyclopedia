Make a move on the beat (when the diamond is green). You can move up, down, left, right OR charge your player. If you charge, your counter goes up. For each charge the player has, the next move will go that many gridspaces in that direction. In addition, the way you kill the other players is by colliding into them with more charge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In addition, there are special gridspots, powerups, and ultimates you can utitilize to defeat your foes. Just make sure you don't miss too many beats, or you'll fall behind.</p>\n<p>So go ahead, get crafty, and beatdown your opponents!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T05:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a3/0a3f6fa381b9326ebe408e253023d690.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["tbittel6", "Jroo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
