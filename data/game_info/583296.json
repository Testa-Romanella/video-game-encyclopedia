The first hill to gather 100 of the score pellets wins. <br/></p>\n<p> Pressing Escape at anytime will take you back to the title screen.\u00a0 The Spacebar will get you 10 new low quality ants to train.<br/></p>\n<p>The fun is in watching the ants grow and reach new distances and get better at being ants, winning is secondary. \u00a0Details about the ants stats are in the help screen.
