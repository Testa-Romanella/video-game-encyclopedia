That was the original project name. I forgot to change it. :)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>How to Play:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD moves the character around\r\n</li><li>Shift to dash\r\n</li><li>Mouse to aim\r\n</li><li>Click to attack</li></ul>\n<p>This is the EARLY test build for my wave based survival game \"The Last Cherry Blossom\"</p>\n<p>You play as the Spirit of the last Cherry Blossom, and your purpose is to defend the tree from the growing Corruption. It is an endless wave survival game. Each wave gets harder as you go on. Currently, the difficulty is only scaled by adding more enemies with each wave. <br/></p>\n<p>There's a 5 second delay between each wave, during which the player will be healed by the tree depending on how close you are to the tree itself.\u00a0 It is possible to be healed to max health between waves. This effect radius also affects your attack damage (Higher the closer you are to the tree). The tree <strong>CAN'T</strong> be healed. The damage it receives is <strong>PERMANENT</strong>. This is intentional. As the health of the tree declines, so does your max health. Because you are an essence of the tree, you can never have more health than the tree. Make defending the tree your priority!</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Dash particles sometimes don't appear</li><li>Heal Effect sometimes doesn't work</li><li>Difficult to see player and enemies when behind the tree</li></ul>\n<p>Please let me know what other bugs you may find! You can do so either here or on Discord!\u00a0I would also love any suggestions and feedback! :)</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/52rUfxcAua<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>-Tyler, Magaldi Studios<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T08:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ff/5ff7d9733859b751094e9f6d75a2ecb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Magaldi Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
