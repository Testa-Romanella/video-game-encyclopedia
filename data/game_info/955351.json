{"id": 955351, "slug": "blue-parasite", "name": "Blue Parasite", "name_original": "Blue Parasite", "description": "Synopsis\r\n<p><strong>Blue Parasite</strong> is a short RPG inspired by SMT 1&amp;2 and Devil Summoner.\u00a0You and your friends discovering a disaster brewing within Gothenburg, Sweden. A pharmaceutical company by the name of The Carnaby Foundation has been experimenting with gene-altering parasites. After being an unwilling victim of one of these parasites, you and your friends decide to put a stop to this madness, once and for all!</p>\n\n<p>Featuring music from <strong>Oblique Occasions</strong> and <strong>G O R E </strong>(Would highly recommend checking them out!):</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game can be played either using keyboard &amp; mouse or using a controller.</p>\r\nKeyboard &amp; MouseGamepadMOVE / TURN:\u00a0WASD, Q/ED-PAD, Left Joystick, LB/RBINTERACT / CONFIRM:Space[XBOX: A] [DUALSHOCK: X]CANCEL:Escape[XBOX: B] [DUALSHOCK: O]START / SUBMITEnter[XBOX: Menu] [DUALSHOCK: Options]\r\n\n\n<br/>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>There are three main components of <strong>Blue Parasite</strong>: <strong>Combat</strong>, <strong>D</strong><strong>ungeon Exploration</strong> and <strong>Dialogue</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Combat</strong> is a straightforward affair of taking turns dealing damage until one side is dead. If your side dies, you reload to the last checkpoint and if the enemy dies, you get rewarded with experience, items and money.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dungeon Exploration</strong> puts the player in a grid-based dungeon where you need to find a way to the exit. The exit could be the actual exit of the building or one of the many puzzles or objectives a level can hold. While exploring, you can find key items and other helpful trinkets hidden in cabinets, trunks and other places. It's never a waste to look in most crevaces.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dialogue</strong> comes down to you reading the words on screen. I did not have the budget or talent available for voice acting so complain on twitter or something. It is perfectly valid to mash your way through the dialogue if it bores you. That's why the skip exists but if you at least pretend to care, that's great. You'll actually know what to do then since objectives are explained in these scenes.<br/><br/><br/></p>\r\nFAQ\r\n<ul><li><strong>Why doesn't the game support other aspect ratios than 16:9?</strong><ul><li>Because the game was very much made on a whim, a lot of the UI is not made to scale properly with most resolutions.<br/><br/>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><strong>Will the game be made available in other languages?</strong><ul><li>No. While I would love to make a swedish localization, it's just not something that's possible without a lot of work and pain.<br/><br/>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><strong>Are you considering making sequels/side games/anything else in the setting?</strong><ul><li>Truthfully, yes. I have a general outline of a full trilogy of games but at the moment my life is hectic enough to start more projects. I will probably return to this at some point because it's fun to work in this setting but we'll see when that is.<br/><br/>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><strong>Why use Unity? [x engine is so much better]</strong><ul><li>We all have our preferences. While Unity has tons of problems, it is still a very solid engine with a workflow that has become my default. I know how to do the things I want to do in Unity and that's been enough for little experiments like what Blue Parasite started out as.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Long live the new flesh!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T14:36:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f3ace76de050ee75da15b8b8030d722.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Momonyaro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
