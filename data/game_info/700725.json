Play as a Provider, a ferryman of sorts for those caught between spaces. Explore Excluded Zones, each unstuck at a different time and populated with creatures and hazards that are not meant to be survived. Use your cunning and curiosity to find what is requested, smite the creatures that stand in your way, and make it back before you're left stranded with no heat to keep you lucid. Stone Castles razed to the ground, souls cursed by greed, creatures feasting on blood and bone alike, and beings older than creation itself await you in PROVIDER.<br/><br/>Explore stories from across time and space, as you set lost souls right on their path to whatever comes next, all while battling back haunting echoes from the past and strange monsters that slip through the cracks in the universal fabric.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T03:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54fa969628075df358fca3e3fe1416e4.jpg", "website": "https://www.cakeneq.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["CakeNeq Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CakeNeq Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
