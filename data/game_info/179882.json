I'm super excited to share this with everyone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enth is a prototype of a sort of game that I've always dreamed of playing - a 2d, action-rpg that has a heavy emphasis on satisfying player progression.</p>\n<p>Player progression:</p>\n<p>Alongside mechanics like stats and levels, I thought it would be cool to have a 'growing' weapon and insignia. What these are are parts of Enth that allow him to progress further and further into the mysterious world ahead of him. His hand-blade can be reinforced, augmented, tinkered with, etc. from blacksmiths around this world, and his insignia gains power through the people of the continent.</p>\n\n<p>As said before, this is my first game, and on top of the game mechanics and structure, I'm also trying to create all of the assets, including the art and story. All of this is a work in progress, and I'm still learning!</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD: Movement</p>\n<p>Left click: Attack</p>\n<p>Right click: Dash</p>\n<p>Space: Interact (with NPCs)</p>\n<p>B: Inventory</p>\n<p>L: Toggle the Quest Tracker</p>\n<p>E: Equipment/Stats</p>\n\n<p>Made with Unity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/153/153b00269d97cdb944e56604c73055f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["krisater"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
