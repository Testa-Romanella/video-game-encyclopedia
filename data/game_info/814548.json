If you don't like it, I suggest you don't download it.\u00a0The game contains some very spicy scenes, and is not recommended for children.</p>\n\n<p>This is a story involving two of my characters, Lance; a Formula 1 driver, and Carol; a model. Lance is ready for the Monaco race and Carol will want to enjoy the snacks in the VIP room. Will you be able to help her enjoy these snacks?</p>\n\n<p>So, I want to make it clear that although I made the entire game, the idea of adapting a tetris for these fetishes was created by Hexalt, in the game Yuletide Sophia (game that I enjoyed a lot and thought about do \"a version of mine\" with my OCs), so I will credit him and leave the links of his social networks.</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Hexalt page</em>: (Hexalto)\r\n</li><li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Hexalt DeviantArt page</em>: (Hexalt)\r\n</li><li>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<em>Yuletide Sophia</em>\u00a0(Game): (Yuletide Sophia)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>And here is the first Bloating Tetris game I made (Bloated Meg).</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Bloated Meg</em>\u00a0(Game): (Bloated Meg)\r\n</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Thank you for playing!
