It features 1 outdoor area with 4 subregions, and 1 dungeon. The demo should take about 2 hours to fully complete.</p>\n<p>I am not an artist, as you will immediately notice. I did the 2D art (poorly) and all of the 3D art is taken from various cc0/cc-by sources online. If you are an artist and are interested in working with me in developing a game based on this prototype, please contact me.</p>\n<p>You can find a video highlighting most of the major features of the prototype here: </p>\n\n<p>You can find a full playthrough of the prototype here: </p>\n<p>Edit: Due to a problem with Unreal's packaging, I wasn't able to export some of the code properly and had to delete it, as well as re-do most of the AI. This means that the AI can now walk on water and no longer follows you while flying, but by the time you get Fly there shouldn't be much left to do anyway.</p>\n<p>Update 11/08/16: Uploaded v1.1 which now includes spellbook icons, so you can see spellbooks and the shop no longer crashes.</p>\n<p>Update 11/10/16: Uploaded v1.2 which now includes the sounds for attacking and casting spells. Hopefully there are no more assets that didn't get included in the package for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Update 11/17/16: Uploaded v1.3 which has a fix for becoming invulnerable after dying, as well as expert alchemy not having any effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d675bd49664f88afb8cab5fbfc5a6735.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hapro"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
