You need to match 3 or more objects by exchanging two pieces in a horizontal or vertical direction. Matched pieces are removed from the board and new pieces dropped back onto the board. The object is to clear the board and advance to the next level. Matching more than 4 pieces can trigger the spawning of power ups with special abilities, helping you clear larger areas of the board. <br/><br/>Massive scores can be quickly achieved by chaining together the matches, these are called cascading combos. Each new combo results in an increase in the score multiplier and continues until there are no more matches for that combo run.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d4/1d482a2b0cb0577ab903f42af68661f0.jpg", "website": "http://meyume.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Meyume"], "genres": ["Action", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["MEYUME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
