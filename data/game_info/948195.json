Here are a few of the modifications that I have made:</p>\n<p>1. I created three completely different levels that are all unique in their own way.</p>\n<p>2. As you will see, each level has their own new challenge that needs to be completed before going onto the next level.</p>\n<p>3. Each level has their own difficulties and as you progress, each level will get harder and harder to complete in order to win the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4. Every level is different with new characters, obstacles, and different ways to find the key in order to proceed to the next round.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy! Thank you.</p>\n<p>-Created by Nicholas Gorelik</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:03:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/014/0140b47f5e9a33d28f88be733da69978.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nickgorelik"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
