They were enrolled, trained and taught in special academies. Hero School Story 2 places you in charge of a hero academy to create the next generation of heroes who will save Valthiria from the dark forces that threaten it. Take command of the faculty, nurture a unique and ever-changing roster of students, forge alliances with the kingdoms who vie for influence and earn your place among the most prestigious Hero Schools in Valthiria. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Combining the RPG and Simulation genres, in Hero School Story 2 you will manage your students by determining their learning schedules and courses, building their stats and skills to shape them into the heroes you desire. These stats are key when sending your students to fulfill quests from people all over Valthiria, defeating various enemies in strategic turn-based combat and adding to your academy\u2019s renown. Yet there\u2019s no time to rest on laurels \u2013 every school year the seniors will graduate and freshmen will enroll, so managing your academy to fit the dynamic roster of students is crucial. <br/><ul><li><h3>Create Your Own Hero Academy</h3>As Principal of the academy, your task is to allocate your students what classes and courses to learn, shaping them into the heroes you want them to become. Will you focus on magical courses and become a school of great wizards, one for mighty warriors, or perhaps a bit of everything? Your management style will determine the kind of quests you can take \u2013 as enemies are locks to students\u2019 keys, fulfilling harder quests will require build specific rosters to solve these challenges. <br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Plan, Forecast, Execute, Repeat </h3>Foresight and strategic turn-by-turn decisions are critical to succeed in our unique turn-based combat system. Built around class-based proficiencies and breaking enemy weaknesses, players are rewarded both for bringing an optimal team composition and taking calculated risks in combat. Whether playing it safe or taking the gung-ho way, it\u2019s up to you how to solve the challenges presented. <br/><br/><br/></li><li><h3>Manage a Dynamic Student Roster </h3>Despite the lure to focus on caring and honing just the best students, as a Principal it is your duty to ensure that every children taken under the wings of your academy thrive. Students will stay for only three years before they must graduate, and every one of them will affect your academy\u2019s reputation (which will deter gifted students to enroll next year!). So manage your whole student roster well, as focusing on just a select few individuals may gimp you when they inevitably leave the school grounds, as you will be left with those less cared for.<br/><br/></li></ul><br/><br/>We\u2019ve updated the development roadmap that would help us set the target for future updates until the full release. As you all probably know, our first few updates have added new champions, dungeons, several new gameplay features, and much-needed extracurricular activities for the students. Up for a quick dip in the river, anyone?<br/><br/>But we digress. You can expect this roadmap to act as pointers to what we\u2019re currently working on for future updates. We aim to add new content (that you can check out below) in each update until the full release of  Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story 2. With that being said, you can expect more cool stuff in the future<br/><br/>As usual, your feedback is greatly appreciated.
