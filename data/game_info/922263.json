{"id": 922263, "slug": "love-letter-to-the-hidden-princess", "name": "Love Letter to the Hidden Princess", "name_original": "Love Letter to the Hidden Princess", "description": "<p>Love Letter to the Hidden Princess is a PC port of the calculator game Love Letter, inspired by the Seiji Kanai card game of the same name. Due to limitations of the calculator, all actions have been reduced to guessing a card. For original actions such as the baron, guessing a card may be interpreted as \u201cbeating a card\u201d instead of literally guessing a card.\r\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay is straightforward. Each turn, the 2 other players choose a card indicating the possible remaining cards, and the player whose turn it is guesses. If someone\u2019s card was guessed right, they are knocked out. The last remaining player or the player who draws the last card from the draw pile wins.\r\n</p>\n<p>This is my first ostensible game supporting computer players (I had plans to make something like Pictionary for the NES but with snakes and ladders), although in my unfinished Zombies!!! port there was a computer assistant to the player that the player could pick up, and the Puerto Rico port also featured a passive \u201ccomputer player\u201d that the player tries to compete against. Nonetheless, this is, unless I\u2019ve misremembered, the first game where you truly play a fully game-playing computer opponent.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game also marks the release of another game after the 7-month hiatus caused by my computers having broken down earlier. Both music pieces in the game are performed, though not composed, by me.\r\n</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This is an unofficial game inspired by the card game Love Letter and is not affiliated with AEG or Z-Man Games.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T05:11:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81d/81d730e83761b8ede0a7d54fde483c6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
