Beat your highscore and use your power ups to go faster and blast through obstacles.</p><p>You need an VR headset and motion controllers to play. Developed for the HTC Vive with the main chopper asset created in Oculus Medium.</p><p>I will update it in the future, this is the first build made of the game done after only 36 hours of developing time so expect numerous (fun) bugs. Future asymmetric gameplay might be included if people like the game. Also a menu as the game just starts right away now and restarts when you die.</p><p>Use the (for now) right touchpad to activate the power ups. Use the trigger to hold onto the motorcycle handle, you can use both hands or one only.<br/></p><p>Created by member of StormBorn Studio:</p><p>Alejandro Castedo</p><p>Marco Boncompagno</p><p>Alvaro Franco </p><p>Giacomo Luchinni</p><p>Music: Lorenzo Visintin<br/></p><p>www.stormbornstudio.com<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/86e/86e9f036913b71bfc9203bc5142718e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ayfel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
