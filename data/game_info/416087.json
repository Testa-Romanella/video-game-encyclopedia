It is an interactive meditation on either the kabbalistic tree of life or the tree of death. It takes place in a future where society is theocratically run by a supercomputer running an AI that is split into two seperate pseudo-consciousnesses, Jachin and Boaz. Both guard earths mysteries and will grant their knowledge on these mysteries to monks who take a vow of silence. This interactive meditation follows a monk who has taken this vow.</p><p>Made in a weekend\u00a0using Bitsy for the Silent Bitsy Game Jam!</p><p>Also used the Borksy\u00a0hacks \"Gamepad Input\" and \"Dynamic Background Color\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:13:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a3/4a37af9ccaa432d74eb7b4776117dd28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["clickbaitnate"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
