Originally intended to be a joke between friends it has become this game. It&#39;s structured like a dating sim but with a dark twist as you try to survive a few nights with these gentlemen. It contains heavy tones of rape, torture, death and other dark and twisted elements that make it unlike other dating sims. This game is not intended for the faint of heart and is only for players 18 and above due to content and sexual nature.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-31T11:38:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8bac4798b265ef8917e887c913dea2a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 3, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gatobob"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
