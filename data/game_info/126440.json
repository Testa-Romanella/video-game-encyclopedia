You can feed it, dote it, talk to it, and itch it to increase it's happiness. The happier the cat is, the more you do damage! </p><p>It was a game of a larger scope until continuous troubles with the game engine led to me cutting it down more and more until this was left. On top of that, after this got submitted I went to make a newer version in that had music and touched up a few areas but then Clickteam Fusion somehow corrupted the game... Maybe? Maybe something got accidentaly clicked but certain layers in the game no longer render and Fissurefury and I don't know what is going on. <br/></p><p><em>Update: Figured out the issue and fixed the bug.</em><br/></p><p>So yeah, it's pretty rough. But I'm still very happy with myself that I saw to it and finished the game on time. You can die, you can win, you can dote a cat.</p><p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/></p><p><strong>WASD to move.<br/></strong></p><p><strong>Mouse to aim and shoot.</strong></p><p><strong>Tab opens pet menu.</strong></p><p><strong>Esc quits.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29e/29ec3840e4550ee35beb977822d888c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Odd_Mutant"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
