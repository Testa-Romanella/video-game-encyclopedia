I am happy that I was able to produce something even if it is late, and that I am disciplined enough to sit down and do the coding and the tutorials.\u00a0 The goal still is to learn as much as I can and in January 2019 start a real game project - that is the goal.</p>\n<p>What went bad: I have scoped too much for a 3d environment which I am not yet comfortable with.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a29/a2965c56598590f07304162408d9ed98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sunny Valley Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
