{"id": 4480, "slug": "mini-ninjas", "name": "Mini Ninjas", "name_original": "Mini Ninjas", "description": "<p>Mini Ninjas is set in a cartoonish version of medieval Japan and puts you into the role of a cute ninja. Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers. There\u2019s no killing and no blood; defeating your enemies will only make them disappear and return to their natural shape. <br />\nThere are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. <br />\nThe game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The \u201cchibi\u201d (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes. There are also elements of Japanese mythology such as Tengu, the friendly magic bird people, who trade with the character, provide training, and offer quests.</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2009-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:49:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1571cdfb52888191eabaf53c2b897240.jpg", "website": "http://www.minininjas.com", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 128, "owned": 2291, "beaten": 157, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 102, "playing": 7}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 71, "ratings_count": 222, "suggestions_count": 457, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 222, "platforms": ["Wii", "PC", "PlayStation 3", "Nintendo DS", "macOS", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Feral Interactive", "Square Enix", "IO Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Family"], "publishers": ["Square Enix", "Feral Interactive", "Eidos Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
