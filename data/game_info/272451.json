In BEAK SQUADRON you fly as the Duck pilot, Sky, and carry out of the orders of esteemed tactician, General Sturn. Fly in different ships, over different worlds, through a 15 mission campaign against the Guinea Pig Empire. Hop in the cockpit to experience a universe and characters that are too ridiculous to be believable.<br/><br/>MOUSE AND KEYBOARD NOT SUPPORTED. BEAK SQUADRON is only playable with a controller.<br/><br/>BE WARNED: This game is extremely unforgiving.
