A full Pico-8 example project intended to spook you out and\u00a0help you learn about strange rendering effects.</p>\n<p>While this game runs at a very low resolution (128x128 with only 16 colors), most of the concepts in it\u00a0can be applied to modern 3D games, as well.\u00a0 For example, if you're interested in\u00a03D character animation, but you don't want to be too\u00a0reliant on using pre-existing tools, then\u00a0the character in this game could be useful\u00a0as an example of how some of this stuff might be done from scratch.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is free to play in your browser (at the top of the page), but if you want to read the source code, you'll have to give me a bit of money.\u00a0 The minimum price is $1, so you can figure out what you think it's worth to you.</p>\n<p><strong>!!
