This is your adventure to Youtooz headquarters.</strong></p>\n<p>Enjoy the game! I worked really hard on it and i don't really have the money to buy all your Youtooz so i thought i'd enter. But despite that i'd thought i'd use this as an outlet to share my care\u00a0to your content in the form of coding, which is the thing i most enjoy. love you, carson.\u00a0</p><p>i feel like this game could have been 10x what it is if i had the time, as most of the assets are placeholders and the physics are buggy and not very good. but at the end of the day it took me about a total of 2 days of work over the span of about 3. Also if you enjoy this, i will gladly make another one of a way longer duration and general better game if you would like. I really like making these games and would like to give this a bit more life then just pngs over some javascript and html. Thank you as always!</p>\n<p>-Ashley.
