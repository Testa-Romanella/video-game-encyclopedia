It turns out to be quite useful however, as throwing it pulls you along for the ride as well. This was made for the GMTK 2021 game jam, and completed in around 24 hours (after restarting twice). Thus, the visuals and polish are lacking. Hope the concept is still fun though.</p>\n<p>All sounds used are credited to\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T18:02:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b641fee921f10ea1b5b211781c106f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrSquish"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
