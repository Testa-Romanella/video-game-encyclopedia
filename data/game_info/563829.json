As a staff member of the titular penguin-specialty zoo freighter<em>, </em>you awake to find your fellow crewmates missing, with the vessel still floating through space. <br/></p>\n<p>Beat the game by picking up and licking stuff, using keycards, and hitting computers with swords. Unravel a mystery that will shock generations, and forge your destiny along one of six unique, dumbfounding endings.<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0<br/></p>\n<strong>What to Type</strong><br/><strong>What it Does</strong><br/>LookLook around the room.<br/>Go &lt;location&gt;<br/>Move to another room.<br/>Examine &lt;item&gt;<br/>Take a closer look at something.Take &lt;item&gt;<br/>Add an item to your inventory.<br/>Use &lt;item in inventory&gt;<br/>Use an item in the current room. <br/>InventorySee what's in your inventory.<br/>Lick &lt;item&gt;<br/>Lick something to gain insight.<br/>\n\n<p>Oh and due to a bug, examining and licking items works only in the room where you get them. So, as much as I hate to say it, you should probably <em>lick everything when you find it</em> (that is, if you want to get all the flavour text - \u00a0the game won't break or softlock or anything if you don't).</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for UofC Game Design Club's Text-Based Game Jam, over the span of a few days.\u00a0 Big thanks to Mark for letting me make him a lick-able object, and for hosting the Jam. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-26T06:18:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21a7b8aa599094a23f4a9c596e1b6201.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Oliver Morrish"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
