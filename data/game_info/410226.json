Choose what lane to move into by using the \"A\" and \"D\" keys.</p>\n<p>You can select between <em>Repair Mode</em> and <em>Cruising Mode.</em> Repair Mode is the standard game play, while Cruising Mode simply lets you cruise through the city without any objective.</p>\n<p>You can also choose to play both these modes with or without music, so you can have your own favorite tracks playing in the background.</p>\n<p>The game keeps going for an endless loop, and there is no win state.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Credits:</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>Graphics, programming and design:</em><br/>Eirik J.
