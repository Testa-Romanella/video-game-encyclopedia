Everything can be mined. Enjoy crafting, building, and fully automating your survival in this strange world.<h3>Game Basics:</h3><ul><li>Many things can be crafted that inherit properties of the material used to craft them<br/></li><li>Mine <strong>Ores</strong> by hand with a <strong>Pickaxe</strong> or by machine, fully automating mining, smelting, and crafting<br/></li><li>Pick up and move <strong>Ore</strong> with a <strong>Pry Bar</strong> to condense your base (your <strong>Pry Bar</strong> needs to be at least as hard as the <strong>Ore</strong> to not destroy it)<br/></li><li>Local grid-based building allows most items to snap into place</li></ul><h3>Basics of Factory Building:</h3><ul><li>Machines are first crafted, then placed, some machines like <strong>Miners</strong> function differently depending on the metal used to make it<br/></li><li><strong>Generators</strong> generate power from an energy source, including fuel and solar<br/></li><li><strong>Power Boxes</strong> route power underground automatically to nearby machines and other <strong>Power Boxes</strong><br/></li><li>You can use <strong>Platforms</strong> made from different metals to isolate power grids from one another<br/></li><li>Machines need enough available power to function<br/></li><li><strong>Battery Backups</strong> can be used to store extra power being generated and supplement the grid when more power is needed<br/></li><li><strong>Conveyors</strong> connect to a machine's ports and can either give or take items, depending on the <strong>Conveyor</strong> direction<br/></li><li>Multiple <strong>Conveyors</strong> can attach to the same port and to each other, allowing for splitting and merging functionality<br/></li><li><strong>Storage Racks</strong> hold items from <strong>Conveyors</strong> and can output items as well<br/></li><li><strong>Filters</strong> can be attached to machine ports to only output certain items</li></ul><h3>Getting Started and Progression:</h3><ul><li>A <strong>Pickaxe</strong> is made by first crafting a <strong>Pickaxe Head</strong> and a <strong>Tool Handle</strong>. Press E or (Back) to open the Crafting Menu<br/></li><li>Click on an item/icon in the Crafting Menu to see its recipe<br/></li><li>Click and drop inventory items into your hotbar to rearrange them<br/></li><li>You can find materials to make a basic <strong>Pickaxe</strong> laying on the ground. Press F or (X) to pick them up<br/></li><li>When night falls you'll need to craft a <strong>Bed</strong>, or wait it out using the flashlight in your <strong>Scanner</strong> to see<br/></li><li><strong>Beds</strong> require <strong>Cotton</strong>, found on plants growing near water<br/></li><li>The terrain can be mined for <strong>Stone</strong>, <strong>Dirt</strong>, and <strong>Sand</strong><br/></li><li>Once you have a <strong>Pickaxe</strong>, you can try to find <strong>Ores</strong> laying around (some <strong>Ores</strong> are found underground!)<br/></li><li>Use the <strong>Scanner</strong> to determine an <strong>Ore's</strong> hardness and type<br/></li><li>Harder <strong>Ores</strong> require harder <strong>Pickaxes</strong> to mine efficiently (same applies to <strong>Miner</strong> machines)<br/></li><li>If you encounter a Coppie (jumpy treasure chest) he's probably just hungry<br/></li><li>Once you smelt the <strong>Ore Piles</strong> in a Furnace, you can set about making new tools, machines, or a base in which to settle down<br/></li><li>A basic automatic mining/smelting setup will need a <strong>Generator</strong>, <strong>Power Box</strong>, <strong>Miner</strong>, <strong>Smelter</strong>, <strong>Storage</strong>, and some <strong>Conveyors</strong></li></ul><br/>Have fun playing!<br/><br/>See more at http://vyrulent.com<br/>Follow the Developer on Twitter https://twitter.com/DemonsionsDev<br/>Subscribe on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJqMOZ5yZqgfPMy2R042KQ", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T02:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff7/ff7b849c94d52863450eceb0846c6851.jpg", "website": "https://vyrulent.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vyrulent Studios", "StarLight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Vyrulent Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
