This week I developed a minimalistic flappy bird game, which I called Block Tap Game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Final Update</p>\n<p>I am happy with what I achieved here. Only two outstanding issues which require more understanding of unity;</p>\n<ul><li>There is an inconsistency Input, such that the game can play differently in different environments.</li><li>I tried to add a screen bounce similar to screen shake, but the effect was inconsistent and jarring.</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Instruction:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Press \"jump\" [space] or [mouse button]\u00a0to propel upwards.</em></p>\n<p><strong>The \"To Do\"\u00a0list [is DONE]</strong></p>\n<p>There are still areas of the game I would like to improve:</p>\n<ul><li>A high score. [done]</li><li>Each level has more consistency in difficulty. [done]</li><li>I had some simple sound effects and the option to mute them. [done]</li><li>I also added some parallax scrolling and some visuals to make the game look better but keep in with the abstract blocky style.</li></ul>\n<p>In my journey of learning game development, I welcome positive and constructive feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:14:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec0/ec079213a20060880081f106eaaf1aeb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stealthness"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
