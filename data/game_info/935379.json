Down below, I'll put my fake package artworks done by me, and the demo of the game itself.\r\n</p>\n\n<p>You can also play\u00a0without downloading the game in this links (Supports mobile devices):<br/>Korean\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\u00a0https://shinhogoesreal.postype.com/post/12599126<br/>Japanese\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u00a0https://note.com/shinhogoesreal/n/n84255e94ed28<br/>English\u00a0https://www.tumblr.com/shinhogoesreal/687988451633725440/what-if-ace-attorney-wa...</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that<br/>*It has <strong>indirect spoilers of AA1~4</strong>.<br/>*includes <strong>trigger to exclusion</strong>, and <strong>horror contents using unrealistic space and human face, low-poly graphic, jump scare</strong>.<br/>*I <strong>maximized the horror elements of original game</strong>.
