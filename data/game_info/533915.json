Integrated GPUs are not supported and will run the game very slowly if at all.</strong> You don't need the top of the line, something around the level of a GTX 1050 should be fine, but an integrated GPU probably won't cut it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>If the game fails to load at all, try a different browser. </strong>The latest Firefox or Chrome should work. Internet Explorer is not supported, although an up to date Edge should also work.</p>\n<p><strong>If the game runs very slowly, make sure </strong><strong>your browser is using the correct GPU. </strong>Many times the browser has to be explicitly told to use the more powerful discrete graphics card. Check the NVIDIA Control Panel (or equivalent) and see if you can set the browser to use a preferred GPU.</p>\n<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Visible seams are present at several places on the planet</li><li>Flow of fluid appears distorted near seams\r\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:32:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e25f02f00c28d45cfe51b53fb238bfe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["rustinlee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
