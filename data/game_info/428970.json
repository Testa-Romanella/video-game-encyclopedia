Experience the award winning twin stick shooter with new graphics, new characters, new enemies, and new gamemodes! In this classic arcade-styled game, up to 6 players can play together locally or online through Steam's Remote Play Together feature. <br/><br/><strong>Updated Graphics</strong><br/><br/>We've completely rewritten the rendering code behind the original game to give SUPER CIRCUIT BREAKERS a uniquely modern, but still classic pixel art feel. Reflections, enhanced explosions, raindrops, and decals have all been improved to give a much more grounded look to an already impressive 60fps game.<br/><br/><strong>New Gamemodes</strong><br/><br/>In addition to a new testing arena where you can try out any character for free, we're bringing a new co-op partially online gamemode called Labyrinth in which you navigate the robot infested ClockCorp factory where an experiment has caused the space-time continuum to collapse. Collect items, recruit wanderers, and save the world yet again!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T07:31:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/622/62283a591bb63d329b8d4dfecd573d1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mirror Queen"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Triverske"], "esrb_rating": null}
