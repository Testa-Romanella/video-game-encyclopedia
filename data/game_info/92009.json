Patch notes: http://bluerevolvergame.com/patchnotes/</strong></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ever feel like the world doesn't understand your talents?</strong> Mae is a rabbit-eared genius programmer, able to manipulate reality with a few keystrokes or - the more fun option - blow up large swathes of reality in one of her custom-built Devices. However, genius is never understood in its own time, and she's provoked a severe response from the environmental group \"Blue Revolver\". Command her defiant counter-attack over 5 stages of manic struggle, blast through hordes of enemies and go face-to-face with fearsome bosses.</p>\n<p><strong>Buying through itch.io supports both us and the site - and you get a Steam key for the game!<br/></strong></p><p>\n</p>\r\nFeatures:\r\n<ul>\n<li> 5 stages of heart-pounding struggle.
