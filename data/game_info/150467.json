It is the culmination of years of video-game studies, and it gives a precise definition of video-game. It's not about art, it's not about stories or poetic fluff, it's a game mostly made of Gameplay. You most certainly never have played a game with as much focus on the player. And isn't what all games should be made for? My only goal here was to maximize player's satisfaction. But as proud as I am to be the author of one of the most important game of this decade, it is also my duty to remain humble. All About The Player has always had two purposes: the first, already proven successful, is to be absolutely exciting to the player. But the second is to inspire other game-designers. It is now no doubt that my game marks a new age for the video game industry, and that there will be discussions about it for generations. I hope my work will help future game creators to make games as powerful as mine, in which all players will be able to relate. Never forget: the most important part of every game is the Gamers. If you are a game developer and remember that rule, one day, you might be able to say \u201cI've made a game that would make Alexandre Pontaise proud\u201d!</em></p><p><em>There is a long way for us game-designers before we fully understand video-game. Therefore, I will always be grateful toward the people that have accepted me as their intellectual lighthouse.</em></p><p><em>But of course, most of my thanks go to you, the players. You are the only actor in the industry that matter, don't ever forget that. I you want to have an even bigger impact, I can't recommend you enough to buy my other games! It would be a true honor for me, really.</em></p>WHAT THE PRESS SAID<p>\n<em>(quotes from 2013 on the mobile game)</em>\n</p><ul>\n<li><em>\u201cAn essential lesson of game-design.

If you want to contact with M. Pontaise, you can send me your message, and I'll try to make him acknowledge it. However I can't guarantee anything, and quite frankly it's unlikely he'll bother to answer. Last time he has been confronted to criticism, well, let's just say some twitter accounts got banned. Don't worry though: I'm certain he won't ever open this page, and he has probably never read himself players' feedback. I'll just answer your questions as much as I can, it's for the best.</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>Game made with Superpowers</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>The font used is Pier Sans</em>\n</p><p>\n<em>Source code \r\n\t</em><em>available on github</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ded/ded6a041c7cfdf76dda14b37c017027d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Itooh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
