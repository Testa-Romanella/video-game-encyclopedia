Nightmares are is something that can happen on the job, but the frequency has been going up. Something is up.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>How To Play:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The dreamers have an emotion bar that will increase, giving them their specific journal or sitting on top of the square (both works) will reduce the emotion point increase. A nightmare will occur when they reach max emotion point, bringing them into a nightmare state and\u00a050 emotion points. fighting them will remove/add emotion points. Sitting on the nightmare square also removes emotion\u00a0points. The fight is just bullethell. At max emotion on a nightmare, the nightmare will spread emotion to nearby neighbors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I bet I forgot a massive bug/oversight\u00a0so your game might softlock or crash, notify me if it occurs so I can ignore the bug again.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Arrow keys to move in dream/nightmare.</li><li>Z to pick up journals/shoot in nightmare.</li><li>X to bomb in nightmare.</li><li>Shift to run/focus.</li><li>ESC to pause.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Four difficulties.
