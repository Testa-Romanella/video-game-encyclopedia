After a LONG time it will be very hard to survive to almost impossible.</p>\n<p>This was just a small 30-40 minute project I made while bored.<br/></p>\n<p>Please lave feedback and enjoy<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:06:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb4/fb412c2394ab4ef6d899a5a4d4b895e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evilous"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
