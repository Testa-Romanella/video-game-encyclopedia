It's an\r\n            experiment of squad mechanics without the fuss of controlling each\r\n            unit one by one.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            You control one space marine at a time, moving them with the keypad\r\n            or arrow keys. You can change focus to any marine in the squad any\r\n            time you want.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            A marine can be put in 'overwatch' mode. Which means they will get a\r\n            free shot at each enemy that moves within their line of sight. This\r\n            is the primary method of attack and defence. It's important to\r\n            position your marines to support each other, the more overwatch\r\n            shots you get the more damage you do.\r\n          </p>\n<p>\r\n            Be careful not to get into close combat. The enemies have deadly\r\n            close range attacks.\r\n          </p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n              Keypad or arrow keys control the movement and direction of the\r\n              active Space Marine. Marines can only move forward or turn.\r\n            </li>\n<li>\r\n              Hold shift while moving to strafe. Strafing takes twice as long as\r\n              regular movement.\r\n            </li>\n<li>\r\n              Press the '&lt;' and '&gt;' keys to switch the active Space\r\n              Marine.\r\n            </li>\n<li>\r\n              Press the 'o' key to enable/disable overwatch on the active space\r\n              marine. The enemy can hear your gunshots so you may want to\r\n              disable it to avoid detection.\r\n            </li>\n<li>\r\n              Press the space bar to enable the inspection cursor. Move the\r\n              cursor with the keypad/arrow keys to get information about your\r\n              surroundings.\r\n            </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:50:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/345/345b2791f31f809567fe56ab654e9490.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdamAlexandr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
