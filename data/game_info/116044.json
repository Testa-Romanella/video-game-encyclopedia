March doesn't know why he's there or what he's supposed to do, and he especially doesn't understand how Rai and growing some plants would help his situation any better. Yet, regardless of how he feels, he can't help but wonder what's going on... Or get frustrated with it all before it even begins.</p><p>\"From the Ashes\" was created for TyranoJam2017 with the theme of \"fresh starts.\" This is my first visual novel and participating in a game jam so I'm very excited to have been able to submit something. I've learned so much from this.</p><p>Please note that the game is still in development.
