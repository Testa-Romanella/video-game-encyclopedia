{"id": 793690, "slug": "everblood-arena", "name": "Everblood Arena", "name_original": "Everblood Arena", "description": "Everblood Arena is a turn-based roguelite tactics arena battler with a heavy focus on procedural generated items and character builds. Get your team of fantasy warriors and take part in 5v5 tactical turn based battles. Rise your way up the ranks and claim the greatest prize, the Everblood Cup!<h3>item randomization</h3>Item randomization is a huge part of Everblood's design philosophy. A huge array of spells &amp; modifiers exist and items through a myriad of algorithms will mix and match these so that each piece of gear comes with it's own skill tree &amp; modifiers. Make tactical choices between leveling up your character's Strength, or leveling up his<strong> Fiery Sword of the Helmsplitter</strong> to unlock it's epic quality rank 3 spell.<br/><br/>This doesn't just stop at items though! Character's will also be randomly generated, with a small variety of races, each containing their own smaller skill tree's with lots of attribute randomization.<br/><br/>Our hope is that this focus on randomization and creating a rogue-lite atmosphere will add lots of replay-ability and create dynamically changing character builds.<h3>a Roguelite?</h3>We intend to add roguelite elements to Everblood, with characters sustaining meaningful injuries (and potential death!) from getting knocked out in combat, we expect players to have to recruit new hero's as theirs die, slowly adapting their tactics and equipment to fit the strength's of their randomly generated character team. Our hope is that each run of Everblood will be a multi-hour affair, with difficulty changing drastically based on your starting roster &amp; the generated teams you come up against", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T05:40:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebd21656e4e5281264772715faef9dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Beanie Bytes"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Beanie Bytes"], "esrb_rating": null}
