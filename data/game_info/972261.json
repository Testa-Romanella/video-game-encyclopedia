It's a fairly small game. The idea is to offer a reduced-to-the-essence experience that is polished and fun. It's great for a quick session to relax your mind, but it does not try to compare itself to bigger games in terms of depth.<br/><br/>I'm happy to hear from you! Send me a mail if you have problems, questions or feedback. I'm getting back to you as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Hope you'll enjoy the game!<br/><br/>Julian", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T08:05:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/960/96048e9785885ab66a304ba34b76f8c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Julian Dietz"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Julian Dietz"], "esrb_rating": null}
