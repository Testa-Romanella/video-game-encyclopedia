{"id": 132174, "slug": "cabin-crew", "name": "Cabin Crew", "name_original": "Cabin Crew", "description": "<p>A little game about feeding and hydrating the passengers of a jet liner. Can be played cooperatively with up to four players (only supports 360 controllers currently).</p>\n<p>Didn't quite get to the completeness of gameplay that I was hoping, but hey, I had fun. There's no win or lose state, just a series of increasingly difficult/impossible levels.<br/></p>\n<p>Cabin Crew was created for the Nerdery Game Jam 2017 in 48 hours. All art, sound, music and code was created by me from scratch during the jam. The game was written in Kotlin and runs on the excellent LibGDX game development framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\r\n360KeyboardMoveLeft stickArrowsPick up, throw (hold+release)XFDrag Cart (hold)ASActivate ElevatorYA", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80a/80adc2985263617c41cbbfb1fddc207c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Justin Mullin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
