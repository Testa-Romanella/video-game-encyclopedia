In fact it took me roughly an month of countless iterations in order to\u00a0achieve a build that I am quite happy with.</p>\n<p>Another reason on why it took me so long to achieve a satisfactory build,\u00a0was that\u00a0lot's of the assets\u00a0where made entirely from scratch with the help from external tools, but even Unity's built-in ProBuilder.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>That being said, since this game was\u00a0created for Unity's learn November game showcase, as the deadline was gradually getting closer,\u00a0I did decide to use several other free assets found in the Unity Marketplace to speed up with the develop process, such as props, audio, and visual effects.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as it was quite some time since I got the chance to practice my basic\u00a0C# skills, I had to sharpen it even further in order to implement some of my much more complicated ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Create your own FPS! -</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Like what you see and feeling\u00a0adventurous?
