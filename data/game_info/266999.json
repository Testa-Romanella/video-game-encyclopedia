(A and D keys). Make sure to beat your heart at the right intervals and try to get the highest score by surviving for as long as possible!</p>\n\n<p>Made for the 2017 Winter Global Game Jam being hosted at Becker College! (Theme: Waves)</p>\n<p>Made by a team of two, this was our first Game Jam that we ever did, and we've been participating in Game Jams since then! As such, don't be surprised by what you see, and just enjoy this small mini-game that we created together!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Author's Note: I did have to edit this game slightly after finishing the game, just to give everyone more time to place their fingers into position after starting the game. I made it more accessible and nothing else!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba300b96305eb18e6bbf99f7288f08b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["AlexDz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
