Maybe too hard... but that makes it more fun, right?!</p><ul><li>Fire Demon</li><li>Knight with Shield</li><li>Jelly that Splits</li><li>Archer</li></ul><p>Let me know if you have any problems with the knight's shields.</p><p><strong>Version 1.3</strong>:  More Billiards Feel.  Players have been asking for longer-range shots and more chances to knock enemies into spikes!</p><p> This update tries to do that without making the gameplay too unpredictable and sloppy.  It expands the movement in the following ways:</p><ul><li>More range for players and monsters</li><li>Boost from bouncing off any wall</li><li>More knockback effects</li><li>Enemies knocking into each other handled better</li><li>Zoomed out camera a bit</li><li>Replaced small spikes with fewer sets of double-spikes that don't come as tightly packed (less careful navigation required)</li><li>Introduced round pillars in the middle of rooms</li></ul><p>See what you think!  I think the game got a bit more interesting, but also maybe a little tougher and needs some more balance tweaks.  Provide some feedback and I'll keep incorporating it in future updates.</p><p>Version 1.2: A total overhaul of the shot preview to make it more accurate so you can play more tactically.</p><p>Version 1.1: A few basic bugfixes from the initial launch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589d5ee34b69973dc1614896f9e5f594.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["savagehill"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
