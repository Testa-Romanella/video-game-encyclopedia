Combining the addictive nature of block building sandbox games with the speed and competition of modern first-person shooters, Guncraft takes voxel-based gaming to a whole new level.

In the heat of battle, soldiers can create custom blockades and fortresses instantaneously.  Watch out \u2013 just when you think you\u2019re safe, enemies can tunnel through walls and dig through floors to ambush you from behind, above or below!<br/><br/>In addition to standard modes like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag, Guncraft offers over seven outlandish game modes like Lava Survival and Racing Mode, plus 100% customizable load-outs that include perks, weapons, vehicles and more.
