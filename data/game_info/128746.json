Shoot at it!</p><p>Every 5 shots you'll have to wait 1 second to reload the gun, so use them wisely.</p><p>As we would like to cook the chicken after having fun with it, try to avoid those pesky birds or it will taste really bad, but that's not match for an experienced shooter like you, right?</p><p>Keep practicing, it's simpler than it seems: shoot the chicken on the left and it will go to the right, hit it on the right, it will travel to the left. Shoot it on the bottom, and will jump higher, shoot it on the top... it will barely jump.</p><p>Made in 12hs for the Indie Ghost Jam.</p><p>No animals were harmed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af1/af14c5f20c6c03686d4556387ec3c462.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Federico Cingolani"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
