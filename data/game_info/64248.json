It will test all of your abilities to escape from the enemies or lead them into traps. It is a <strong>pickup and play game</strong> you can enjoy in short to mid play sessions, which makes it perfect to play while you wait in queue for another game. Even though Elude is a small, score chasing game, where the only goals are to constantly beat your previous score and brag about it to your friends, it is packed with exciting re-playable gameplay and <strong>fun </strong>moments.<br/><br/><br/> \u00b7 The objective is simple,<strong> Stay alive</strong> as long as you can.<br/> \u00b7 You <strong>don\u2019t stop moving</strong>.... ever. So make sure you don't crash.<br/> \u00b7 <strong>Get the highest score</strong> you can by making enemies crash each other or trapping them in your trails.<br/><br/><br/> \u00b7 Steer left and right avoiding enemies. <br/> \u00b7 Use your boost to get away from the more aggressive ones.<br/> \u00b7 Hold space to leave a trail that will kill enemies on impact. But be careful, crashing into it will end your run too.<br/><br/><br/> \u00b7 It is very easy to learn.<br/> \u00b7 All players can stream and monetize Elude footage.<br/> \u00b7 Controller support.<br/> \u00b7 Endless, fast-paced and constantly gets harder.<br/> \u00b7 Perfect for playing while in Queue for another game.<br/> \u00b7 Easy mode for those who find it too challenging at first.<br/> \u00b7 Steam Achievements.<br/><br/><br/>I just recently started my journey as an indie developer, so I\u2019m focusing on small, single mechanic yet solid fun games. By purchasing this game you would help me continue creating <strong>more and better games</strong> (which would be <strong>awesome</strong>). I\u2019d love to hear from you, so please contact me through Twitter if you find something wrong in the game, or just want to say hello.<br/>I hope you enjoy the game.<br/>Alex Zaragoza", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/312/312b3a0a6710f3cedfc66ccb648f3a34.jpg", "website": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y33iNws00IE&amp;feature=youtu.be", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rock Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rock Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
