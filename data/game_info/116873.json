A runner game with no running.</strong><br/></p>\r\n\r\n\tStory\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tOne team, four lives. Keep the team going and unveil each other's story. But things happen in life. And then, what do we do now? What if our choices ruins your dearests' life?</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<ul>\n<li>Press spacebar to walk, release to stop and switch to the next character</li>\n<li>Interact with object by stopping at them</li>\n</ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>If an <strong>object </strong>is near the character who is <strong>stopping</strong>, she will interact with the object by <strong>remembering memories</strong> of her life, thus <strong>affecting positively</strong> or <strong>negatively</strong> the <strong>global mood meter</strong> at the top of the screen.If the mood meter falls to zero, game over.</p>\n<p>To reach the end of the path at the far right, you must learn the story of each character and <strong>their common story</strong>. This means knowing the <strong>character-object</strong> <strong>combinations</strong> in order to keep the mood meter high.</p>\r\nInteresting Notes\r\n<p>The <strong>furry characters</strong> were added because we wanted to draw <strong>anthropomorphic characters</strong> based on local animals (the designing team  come from Alsace, East of France) : a stork, an european hamster, a fox and a bear (ok we don't have so many bear here).<br/></p>\r\n\r\n\tCredits\r\n<p>\r\n\tAntoine Schmoll : Graphics/Animation/Game Concept\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tGilles Noeppel : Game Concept/Ressources/Croissants<br/>\r\n\tJeremy Touitou : Game Concept/Scenario/Audio\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tJulien Doudoux : Programming/Messing with the team name</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Big thanks</strong> to the <strong>Ludus Acad\u00e9mie Strasbourg</strong> for hosting us during the <strong>Global Game Jam 2015</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08d/08d972c4c579ffdce10a99c032ac820d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NoDevAtAll"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
