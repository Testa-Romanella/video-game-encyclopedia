The robot's abilities are determined by the batteries installed in the power zone; the batteries can be pushed into the power zone to directly affect the robot. But as power to the robot is increased, it gets more difficult to control. Keep your eye out for special battery types as well!\u00a0Can you solve all ten puzzles?</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Move with the arrow keys</p>\n<p>- Undo a move with the Z key</p>\n<p>- Reset a puzzle with the R key</p>\n\n<p>Design and Programming by Erik Jovanovic</p>\n<p>Art by Franceska Chartrand</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This was a project I had to do for an introductory Javascript course in summer of 2019. I put in way more effort than was necessary and basically earned a 100% on it halfway through the semester, but I was still required to show up to labs to work on the project so I just kept adding levels and improving on it. I'm pretty proud with how it turned out!</p>\n<p>Eventually I'd like to come back to this and remake it in a language more suited to the game. Since I was making it as I learned various concepts in Javascript, there are a ton of inefficiencies that I'd love to revisit. For example, we didn't learn about the concept of objects until most of the way through the course, so all of the levels are stored as 64-character strings! Some of the changes I'd like to implement when I revisit Sokobot are:</p>\n<p>- smoother animation</p>\n<p>- music/sounds</p>\n<p>- better transition between levels</p>\n<p>- feature to toggle tutorial text on or off</p>\n<p>- a level select and/or save function</p>\n<p>- a simple level editor</p>\n<p>- redesigned 8th and 9th levels</p>\n<p>- variable level sizes (currently all levels are always 8x8)</p>\n<p>- one-way tiles</p>\n<p>- lava tiles</p>\n<p>- heat-resistant battery</p>\n<p>- like 5-10 more levels</p>\n<p>- a proper ending, and a title screen</p>\n<p>Since I'll probably start over from scratch when rewriting it, I'll throw the Javascript version up here so I can wash my hands of it. Let me know your thoughts\u00a0in the comments, and I'll keep them in mind when I remake it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T02:35:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd9/fd9738161b31cdace14066c7efaff600.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ErikWMJ"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
