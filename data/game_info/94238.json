Are you ready for the challenge?\u00a0Feel\u00a0free\u00a0to\u00a0leave\u00a0your\u00a0high\u00a0scores\u00a0in the\u00a0comments\u00a0below.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>The object of the game is to move Patrick around the board and remove all 28 squares. Squares with square symbols on them will remove extra squares, and can make the puzzles trickier or easier.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li><strong>D-pad</strong>: Select square</li><li><strong>A</strong>: Move</li><li><strong>B</strong>: Load a new level (if you haven't moved yet)</li></ul>\r\nHow to run the game\r\n<p>If you're unable to play on a real Game Boy, you will need to download the ROM and run it in an accurate Game Boy emulator that simulates uninitialized RAM. I recommend\u00a0BGB.</p>\n<p>I have unfortunately not found a JavaScript/WebAssembly emulator that simulates random uninitialized memory, so none of them\u00a0can run this game in the browser, as I rely on random uninitialized memory values as a seed for level generation.\r\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This is a\u00a0fanmade Game Boy\u00a0sequel to the 1998 freeware sensation\u00a0<em>Patrick's Challenge II</em>\u00a0by\u00a0Reldni Productions, for\u00a0GBJAM 6.</p>\n<p>Created from scratch in assembly, using RGBDS. Tested and debugged in\u00a0BGB\u00a0(and on an actual Game Boy).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a3/4a3edb9e6260546744b0d7592dde7cf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tobiasvl"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
