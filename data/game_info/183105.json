The theme for the jam was \"sandwiches\" - and while we were initially very underwhelmed by the theme, we had a great time creating the art assets and gameplay mechanics for our game.</p><p>The premise of the game is that your character is the main feature of a <strong>sandwich in the making</strong> and you are trying to <strong>escape the sandwich</strong>! Ham, Tuna, Egg, and Cow must all play together (four-player local co-operative play!) and escape. Anyone who doesn't make it must doom the team to sandwich heaven or be left behind.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c26/c262015310f97d94e42f001a069d85c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["brianisbrilliant"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
