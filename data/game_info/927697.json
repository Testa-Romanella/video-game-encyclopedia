Or buy items in the town and then resell them to the other villagers. The only goal is to make as much money as possible. You can see your current inventory at any time by entering the pause menu, and can trade with the villagers by walking towards them when next to them.</p>\n<p>Be careful though, the cave is filled with monsters, and you have no way to kill them easily. Avoid fights where possible, or stun enemies and push them back by walking into them. If an enemy is pushed up against the wall, it is possible to kill them after they are stunned.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement in the menu / game\r\n</li><li>RETURN - Selection in the menu / game\r\n</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Font Package - Kenney\r\n</li><li>Tiny Town - Kenney</li><li>Tiny Dungeon - Kenney</li><li>Pixel UI Pack - Kenney</li><li>Particle Pack - Kenney</li><li>Crystal Cave - Cynicmusic</li><li>Town Theme RPG - Cynicmusic</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T16:25:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92b/92ba9ed6fafc71dedd40c9351d51b0a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
