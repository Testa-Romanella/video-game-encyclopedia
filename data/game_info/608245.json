As always first pick your target, using the profile app (the left most app) - a reminder to note your target's interest before choosing the profile. Just in case you forget, our level 2 princes have upgraded the email app (the middle app) to provide a helpful reminder of your target's interests. For those that missed our last corporate getaway, our Nigerian prince consultants agree that we only get 8 critical words per email to convince our targets to give us their money, so we've adjusted our email app accordingly. Thanks to our unique profile target algorithm even when we get some of the target's favorite words in an email, they still will give us some of their money. Lastly you can see all your earnings in the currency app (the left most app).\u00a0</p>\n<p>**Our Markov peasant department have reported that after the upgrade to the email app some princes have begun reporting a sharp decrease in battery life for their cellphones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Regards, Queen Markov</p>\r\nSources\r\n<p>Scams are generated based on source scams emails from https://www.419eater.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:45:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d95/d95f8561f251a90fe0aa9ae0df37412d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sebjugate"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
