According to how many \"A\" and \"B\" you got in before turns, you'll guess the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n  In the game, you can:<br/>\r\n  --play Bulls and Cows with 3, 4, or 5 digit numbers;<br/>\r\n  --a timer can record how long the time you use to success;<br/>\r\n  --a pace counter can record how many paces you use;<br/>\r\n  --make your success result to a local rankings save file;<br/>\r\n  --play while listening a classic music;<br/>\r\n  --with your friends, play the game one by one, and see who's the best and cleverest.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n  Who's Jether?
