This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative location. For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.</p>\n<p>If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then it wins that local board.</p>\n<p>Once the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board.</p>\n<p>Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.</p>\n\n<p>Right click to restart.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2a/d2ab7167e215ac608f9cf083dae09dec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thu_denny"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
