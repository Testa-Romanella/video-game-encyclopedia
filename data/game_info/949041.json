You play as a blocky square guy and you have to dodge or shoot the zombies that attack you.</p>\n<p>Use the arrow keys or wasd to move, aim with your mouse pointer and click to fire your gun. Its pretty simple tbh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Avoid cars; they will kill you.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and have fun :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T13:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8b/c8b92c249b6af727c9d54f564885a986.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Calvin Art Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
