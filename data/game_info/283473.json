Fall off the screen and you will not be able to recover!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>ASDW / Control Keys = Movement and Jumping</p>\n<p>Space Bar = Strike (destroys platform and / or kills fly)</p>\n<p>Shift =\u00a0Run! Useful for not falling and dying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Mechanics &amp; Advice</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Your hoe can destroy multiple platforms and enemies at once. Keep this in mind when you hold space when making a big leap of faith.</p>\n<p>2. Do not get discouraged by the grade you get after your first 5 game overs. It only takes one push to easily get over 500 points.</p>\n<p>3. Comment your high scores here!</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Scissors Item</strong>: Slows down the rate that the platforms spawn at. This could be good or bad, depending on how annoying the platforms are and at what point of the level you are at.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Water Bucket Item</strong>:\u00a0Slows down the speed the camera and beanstalk rises at. You will love getting this item.</p>\n<p>6. Once you start seeing leaves falling down on the screen, the real portion of the\u00a0game starts...! Good luck!</p>\n<p>7.<strong> Blue Fly</strong>: Moves horizontally and is worth <strong>8 points </strong>per kill.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Red Fly</strong>: Moves vertically and is worth<strong> 12 points</strong> per kill.</p>\n<p>9. <strong>Platform</strong>:\u00a0Each platform is worth\u00a0<strong>5 points</strong> per one destroyed.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Smart Random Algorithm</strong>:\u00a0The random platform generation follows a couple of rules established in the code, so over 90%+ of the times you play, they should spawn in fair rates and reasonably reachable locations.
