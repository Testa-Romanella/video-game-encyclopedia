Power hungry leaders of the repressive Bungeling Empire have stolen a fortune in gold from the peace loving people, and you&#39;ve just discovered their secret underground treasury. Your goal? To recover every last ingot of Bungeling booty. You&#39;ll be running, jumping, and climbing heroically, solving perplexing puzzles, and drilling passageways through stone floors and barriers using your laser drill pistol. You&#39;ll need more than fleet feet and good looks to get through this mission alive. You&#39;ll need your quick wits and brains!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-12T16:06:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/054/0540c8fc8eed3fc13d3990f419c61c6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.91, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 29, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 50, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 64, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 14, "reviews_count": 64, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Classic Macintosh", "NES", "Apple II", "Atari ST", "Atari 8-bit", "Game Boy Advance", "PC", "Atari XEGS"], "developers": ["SEGA", "Hudson Soft", "Broderbund Software", "Irem", "Loriciels", "Aisystem Tokyo", "SystemSoft", "Software Projects"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "SEGA", "Konami", "Atari", "HUDSON SOFT", "Broderbund Software", "Br\u00f8derbund", "IREM", "Ariolasoft", "Hudson Soft Company", "Software Projects", "SystemSoft", "Apollo Technica", "Tozai", "Universe"], "esrb_rating": null}
