OST is about 520 MB in size.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Budget about 500 MB for the game files.</li><li>Even the Ocean will run at a locked 60 FPS on most computers with a GPU. For comparison, development was done with a GeForce 610M . Multiple resolution sizes and a 30 FPS mode are available for lower-performance computers.</li><li>Some Macs have trouble running at high scaling resolutions. In this case, the problem is usually fixed by playing at a lower resolution or in 30 FPS.</li><li>For unknown reasons, livestreaming at certain resolutions at 60 FPS causes lag in the game. I recommend 30 FPS or lowering the resolution of the game.</li><li>For unknown reasons the sound may drop out on Macs at times. This will often fix itself after a few seconds.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Version History</strong></p>\n<p>- 1.018 for Windows/Mac (11/26/17) - Adds Simplified Chinese, Russian, German.</p>\n<p>- 1.014 for Windows/Mac (1/15/17)</p>\n<p>- 1.013 for Windows (12/22/16)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/506/5067f51858f5d4f085180ae8d2200de8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sean Han Tani", "Marina Kittaka"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
