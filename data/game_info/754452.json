Your only drone is managing to keep you stabilized, but it is only temporary. So, you must take control of the drone to mine ores from the planet to hopefully repair yourself back to 100%. Unfortunately with the drone away mining the planet you are slowly destabilizing. Make sure to get the drone back in time to avoid exploding and destroying the planet.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Arrow keys: Move drone in 4 directions.</p>\n<p>x key: enter the core, dig down a level on open space, pickup sensor upgrade\u00a0and other menu options shown</p>\n<p>z key: break walls and ores underground, and other menu options.</p>\n<p>Warning: Some excessive flashing lights. Also initial volume is loud as I can't code it to be lower on loading. Suggest keeping mute then once you hit the play button, hit enter, select options and turn sound off or lower volume.</p>\n<p>Good luck and hope you enjoy the first game I've ever made.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T15:53:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44a/44ad0390ba4b0589efb338362b2f7af6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ThumperTWS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
