Obviously, being in ancient Mongolia, ammunition would be limited, thus you would only have 7 bullets to find and kill your target.</p>\n<p>This sketch was made with the goal of reaching a fully playable concept phase within one month, including a level, enemies, and victory/loss conditions.</p>\n<p>Genghis Khan wears red, and awaits in a temple at the top of the mountain. His soldiers lie between the two of you and will attack you on sight. Can you find and kill Genghis Khan with only 7 bullets in your gun?</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD to move, and mouse to look<br/>Left Shift does a little dash<br/>Space bar jumps<br/>You can double jump, and dash while in the air<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T12:42:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07e/07e168355d698db7dea5c942fda05f54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["flynncat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
