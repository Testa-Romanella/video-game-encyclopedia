Place these pieces anywhere to make completing the jigsaw quicker/easier. Play against the clock or just take your time (no-one's keeping score).</p>\n<p><strong>Submissions extension update:</strong></p><p>I have added a few more levels, fixed some bugs, and attempted to make things look a little better.<br/></p>\n<p>This is my second game jam and second (completed) game. It was written from scratch using P5.js. Starting only with the premise of hammering jigsaw pieces so that they 'fit in', it has been an interesting challenge to make a game out of it. I think that there is more that can be done with it and I welcome opinions and suggestions from those who play it</p>\n<p>Some ideas and a lot of the visual polish had to be dropped to get the game done in time.</p>\n<p>My initial, very different idea, was progressing until it hit a slight road block: It wasn't challenging or fun to play! Fortunately, the extra long time for this jam gave me an opportunity to ditch the whole thing and start again..</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T07:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f676fa6b71ef14defd08b79972b3292a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CodeBug"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
