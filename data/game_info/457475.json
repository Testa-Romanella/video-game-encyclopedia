When people tell True stories, they sometimes have no follow-up or continuation, and they end just like that. However, I've created the Daydream Diary, which is a category where I can daydream about your True stories and make spin-offs bases off of your entry, and from there, a series is born. You will be able to vote in what Diary Entries you'd like to have a Daydream(spin-off/continuation).\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\n</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p>\u2022 All dialogue and route based choices are free.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Player chooses their name.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Create an avatar: hair, skin, clothes and more.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Develop relationships with characters<br/></p>\n<strong><strong>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<br/>\n<p><strong><strong>&lt; Kickstarter sneak peak &gt;</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong><strong><strong><strong>\u00a0+ Special character illustration graphics (in-game and in the picture gallery)\r\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong> <em>+</em> <em>Diary: The Naked Truth Your Experience on ios</em>\n</strong></strong></strong></li></ul>\n<strong><strong><strong>\n<strong><strong>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</strong></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For updates\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<strong><strong>\n<p>Individual creator, Just me, Army of one, + all of you who support my work \u2764\ufe0e Thanks!</p>\n<strong><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n</strong></strong>\n<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><em>\u2122\u00a9Diary: The Naked Truth Your Experience All Rights Reserved</em></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>\n</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T04:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1df4d20aeb67e4022943cd7058875c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Beastcarving Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
