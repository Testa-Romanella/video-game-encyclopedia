Much style!</p><p>\r\n\tYou can flap past your wallet to boost your multiplier, but the game will become more difficult, and you risk losing everything!  If you fall into your wallet at the end of a round, your dogecoins will be saved!</p><p>\r\n\t\"Doge: To the Moon!\" was developed in GameMaker within 72 hours for a game jam at my university.
