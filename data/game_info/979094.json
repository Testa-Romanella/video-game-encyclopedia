{"id": 979094, "slug": "town-of-sins", "name": "Town of Sins", "name_original": "Town of Sins", "description": "Imagine yourself in a perfect town, where everyone\u2019s a prim and proper lady, like they\u2019re living a Victorian novel?! And then, there\u2019s you\u2026 the one who got super drunk with a bunch of whores, and woke up the next day at snoozefest, in the middle of fucking nowhere.<br/><br/>Your goal now? Shake things up or die of boredom trying! This town is about to get turned upside down, so get ready for a world of BDSM, seduction and power play!<br/><br/>Seduce those uptight prudes and teach them a thing or two about real fun. It\u2019s not about hearts and flowers, it\u2019s about getting down and dirty.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Every card in play must be evolved and learn special transformations to become stronger in battle. Every cute little lassie around must take it in every hole and become a strong, beautiful bitch in the process.<br/><br/><br/>There are four types of cards in the game:<br/>* <strong>Characters</strong><br/>* <strong>Items</strong><br/>* <strong>Residents</strong><br/>* <strong>Combos</strong><br/>The battle in this game is like nothing you have ever seen. The bitches... well, their name is legion. And there\u2019ll be no shortage of very piquant and sexy stories on the way to every one of your conquests. That\u2019s how it is going to be, every time, with every new event in the game. In every district that you make yours. With every new trick you teach your cards. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>The game features a huge collection of cards.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are over 700 cards and new ones are introduced every month. Don\u2019t forget your girls aren\u2019t \u201cjust cards\u201d! All of them have at least 5 secret combo strikes up their sleeve and unique personalities.<br/><br/><strong>Characters </strong>\u2013 cards depicting girls of different occupations or types. They may be of five different rarities: common (gray), rare (green), epic (blue), legendary (red) or mythic (golden). During the battle, you can put together a Character card and an Item card for a more powerful combo.<br/><br/><strong>Items </strong>\u2013 cards depicting all kinds of things. Just like Character cards, they may be of five different rarities. During the battle, they could be combined with Character cards to produce a combo.<br/><br/><strong>Residents </strong>\u2013 cards depicting girls resident in a certain neighborhood. They have better health (HP) and unique skills. They are particularly useful as defensive cards, and their skills produce a strong effect on the outcome of the battle.<br/><br/><strong>Combos</strong> \u2013 cards featuring the fusion of a Character girl with some Item. Combos are investigated in the Workshop and are key to winning in battle. Combos are much stronger than the sum total of the cards used to produce them.<br/><strong>You will not find such an abundance of choice porn anywhere!</strong><br/><br/>So many that we lost count of them ourselves. There are Comic Books in every district and event. Each card has at least 5 porn transformations built into it. Many MYTHIC CARDS have their own comic book. And all of this wholesome goodness is tidied up into one awesome storyline that will literally blow you away!<br/><strong>Enjoy our unique combat experience that features an extensive array of combinations.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/>It\u2019s not just that every card has its own quirks and favorite strikes. The cherry on the cake here is that all of those cards could form combos, and that\u2019s what really matters. Every combo unlocks the girl\u2019s new porn transformation, which only makes her stronger. The game will have many combat leaders (avatars), each of them with their very own eccentricities. You will succeed by exploring the combos and crafting the best possible deck for every new situation you face.<h3>New Updates Every Week!</h3><br/>If, at some point, you come to believe you\u2019ve already had every girl in town - think again!
