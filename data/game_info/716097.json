There is still so much to be decided and help from the community will be a must to create a perfect game for us all to enjoy. The game will be single player until later when it will move to multiplayer and you will be able to join friends, host parties, chat with people, etc! we plan to eventually hire a modeler to make many outfit pieces and make a way for players to be able to create their very own Fursona in game, not just looks but also a personality youll be able to list your likes and dislikes and tell other players all about who you are! So Exciting! It will take much work to get there but it will get there! :) Consider joining the discord server to give your ideas and opinions so we can shape the game into something furry awesome!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Discord Server</p><p>Paypal Donation Link</p><p>We will also be setting up a Patreon page very soon so anyone who is willing and able to donate can :) if we can get donations coming in we can keep the game free and available to everyone for testing during development\u00a0and start working on multiplayer and character customization\u00a0sooner!</p>\n<p>*Enjoy the fireworks until January 2nd!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9fd14bf77cccc2c25509751a46dafe0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["X-JazJaz-X"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
