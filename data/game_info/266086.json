Dash your way to your opponents' stations and steal their energy. Make sure you bring it back to your own generator before another opponent tackles you! First player to 20 energy wins!<br/></p>\n<p>ONLY PLAYABLE WITH GAMEPADS: one gamepad is required for each player - the game creates up to four players based on how many controllers are found. Please note that the game has only been tested with Xbox 360 controllers, but in theory most kinds of controllers should be supported.<br/></p>\n<p>Glorbz was made during a weekend-long game jam by Jonas Svensson and Alexander Strandberg. The theme for the game jam was \"Jumping Spacestations\".</p>\n<p>The music track is \"Defense Line\", downloaded from www.dl-sounds.com.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68d/68de05f7099945fef199c1946af1168a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Slaggeklubben"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
