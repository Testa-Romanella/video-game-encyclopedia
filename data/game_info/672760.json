Your job is to take courier potions across the realm. These days something seems different and the potions are becoming increasingly unstable along with the routes to deliver them.</p>\n<p>Deliver the potions before they explode and taking you with them. Jumping, landing and trauma will cause the stability meter to drop. When it hits 0 the potion will explode and it will be game over.</p>\n<p>Controls (keyboard)</p>\n<p>A: Talk to Quest Giver</p>\n<p>S: Accept Quest</p>\n<p>Z: Jump</p>\n<p>X: Use a stabilizer...increasing the meter.</p>\n<p>A gamepad can be configured and used. Pressing Esc and select gamepad options from the menu.</p>\n<p>Note of Linux:</p>\n<p>There may be Linux dependencies, most likely you\u2019ll need libsndio 6.1. On Arch you can install \u2018libsndio-61-compat\u2019 from the AUR, on other distros there\u2019s probably an equivalent package.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T05:11:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae1/ae122c1d27b77f404015dde7eb5a5ca9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["morokiane"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
