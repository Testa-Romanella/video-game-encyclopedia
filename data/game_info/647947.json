In some distant past, the demons who cursed this land were defeated and pushed across the Frozen Sea to the north. Today, the mighty Sentinel Obrest and her Knights of the Realm keep watch over the kingdom from their heavily fortified High Tower Citadel. Any sense of safety is precarious at best, because from the north come the Sons of Skandir, a shadowy enemy set upon destroying the kingdom from within.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Obrest</strong> is a seaside swords-and-sorcery setting created by Horos and Colin for adventure and inspiration.
