So here we are.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IT IS</strong></p>\n<p>In the desert, things move slow... almost unnaturally so. But at night, the mesas and valleys come alive with spirits and deities of all species and from all walks of life. Today's story focuses on the Trickster spirit, Coyote, as they are wrapped up in the center of an otherworldly phenomenon. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is unfinished and plays like a visual novel. Instructions are simple... Click the yellow text or arrows to progress the game. It's about as simple as it can possibly be due to the one hour restriction... But that worked to my benefit for this game because I finally got to add visuals to my writing, which was _COOL!</p>\n\n<p><strong>(also-- for the curious:\u00a0n\u00f3tt = night in icelandic) </strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:42:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a4/9a45909fc6bb1cb2f1da1391c5517c5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pacific"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
