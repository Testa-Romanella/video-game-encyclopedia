Previously, it was known as FlatOut: Total Carnage.</p>\n<p>This arcade embodies the canon of the genre and preserves the reality of the physical parameters of what is happening on the screen.</p>\n<h3>With what to go out on the track and what to expect on it</h3>\n<p>Each car has forty parts that can be damaged - be careful. Or do not be - experience the pleasure of eight thousand objects that can be destroyed on each track.</p>\n<p>Every scratch, every blow is visible to the eyes and noticeable in driving - and every destruction you inflict is absolutely realistic, like fog, dust, smoke, splashes.</p>\n<h3>Your style, your mood</h3>\n<p>Before the race, set the style of the race, its mood, choose from a variety of options: arcade, Deathmatch Derbie, race for time and destruction.</p>\n<p>You can choose from forty-eight cars and thirty-nine tracks, in six different environments, from deserts to metropolis.</p>\n<p>You can invite up to eight friends to play, for this there is a multiplayer mode.

Everyone has an individual style of riding, character and temperament - you will not be mistaken, after meeting them on the track. Here are just a few of their CVs.</p>\n<p>Jack Benton prefers cars that can perfectly hit - fast, small, but heavy. His aggression exceeds experience - it makes him even more dangerous.</p>\n<p>Sofia Martinez prefers light cars to drive sharply and drive fast. But she can be seen and on a heavy pick-up truck, by which she tries to split all who can.</p>\n<p>Jason Walker is unpredictable in everything except one - he always chooses muscle-cars. He uses experience to beat his opponent with feeling.</p>\n<p>Katie Jackson is hysterical and aggressive at the same time, she&#39;s not a rival, she&#39;s a moving obstacle.</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2007-06-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-28T01:24:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d1f/d1fd55f7b29e385259fa857aac7c3b0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.99, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 1335, "beaten": 162, "toplay": 11, "dropped": 73, "playing": 5}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 32, "ratings_count": 211, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 6, "reviews_count": 211, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Bugbear Entertainment"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Strategy First", "Empire Interactive"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
