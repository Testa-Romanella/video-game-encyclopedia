You\u2019d wait for a duck to start taking flight out of the bushes, point your gun at the screen and squeeze the trigger. A fast shot and steady hand was required to make a kill and if you missed, that dog popped up and snickered at you. <br/><br/><br/>That dog was funny but also frustrating at times. The thought of turning your Nintendo gun on him crossed your mind once or twice, especially when you were having a bad game, but it wouldn\u2019t have been the same without him. <br/><br/>Some very exciting changes come with this update of Mario Duck hunt app. First of all, a large flock of ducks has been added as a bonus level. Veteran Duck Hunt players will be especially delighted to let loose at the whole glorious flock. Plus, fans of our original mobile game have let us know that the DOG isn\u2019t exactly man\u2019s best friend, quite the opposite! We feel your frustration and have improved the gameplay based on your suggestions! The game now includes special levels that allow you to shoot the ANGRY DOG!  Yes, really! Now you can let that snarky primate know who is boss from time to time. You just have to play the new version of Mario Duck hunt app!<br/><br/>Well now, Duck Hunt can be more than a pleasant memory because there\u2019s a new version of that fun and challenging game that you\u2019re going to love just as much. It\u2019s called Mario Duck hunt app and you can play it right on your iPhone, IPAD.<br/><br/>Mario Duck hunt app has cool graphics and more detailed backgrounds than the original game. The classic play concept is the same but in a more modern setting. You still get to choose between one or two duck games, still have to shoot as many as you can. One of the main differences that you\u2019ll notice is that YOU CAN SHOOT THE ANOYING DOG (THE ANGRY DOG). <br/><br/><br/>COOL FEATURES:<br/><br/>\u2714 Smooth navigation, easy to use <br/>\u2714 Shoot the ducks, your finger is the gun <br/>\u2714 Incredible modern graphics <br/>\u2714 Angry dog! <br/>\u2714 International leaderboard for comparing scores <br/>\u2714Same fun and challenge of the classic Duck Hunt game <br/>\u2714 Gives you a nice feeling of nostalgia", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:18:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ee/9ee43a1bbe4888f79614f22a2c539a28.jpg", "website": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BTbi89mAsM", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["AhorrecompArando"], "genres": ["Sports", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["maria camila ECHAVARRIA"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
