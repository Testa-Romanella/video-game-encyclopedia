In this arcade style space shooter, only the fittest enemies reproduce to create the next generation, causing the population to adapt to your play style. How long will you be able to survive against the Protean Swarm? <br/><br/>Darwin\u2019s Demons models biological evolution using enemies with digital genomes. Enemies acquire fitness by being the most aggressive, accurate, and longest lived, and only the most fit enemies reproduce to pass their genomes on to the next generation. The result? The creatures you found hardest to kill have all the babies, making each generation more challenging than the last! <br/><br/>In <strong>ARCADE MODE</strong>, take command of 22 different ships, 18 defensive systems, and 11 secondary weapons to battle the Protean Swarm.<br/><br/>In <strong>LOCAL MULTIPLAYER MODE</strong>, up to four players can fight the swarm side by side.<br/><br/>In <strong>EXPERIMENT MODE</strong>, get your nerd on and take control of the evolutionary model.  Change parameters such as mutation rate, population size, and the fitness function, to test your own evolutionary hypotheses.<br/><br/><strong>Be warned</strong>:  No matter your play style, your enemies WILL adapt to your selection of ship, weapons, and defenses.<br/><br/>Climb the leaderboards as high as you can, but in the end....<br/><br/><br/><strong>EVOLUTION ALWAYS WINS</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:13:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e57/e57ea67905c5feb47a7f7dcd6d0b662c.jpg", "website": "http://www.polymorphicgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 124, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Polymorphic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Polymorphic Games", "University of Idaho"], "esrb_rating": null}
