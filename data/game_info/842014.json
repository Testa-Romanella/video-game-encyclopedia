It's also about bodies and transness and neurodivergence, even if it doesn't directly tell you that.</p>\n<p>I wrote it on a plane from the US to Sweden and then some more at my friends' apartment in Sweden and finished it right before moving into my own apartment in Sweden. It is my entry in the 2022 Trans Joy Jam.\u00a0Please look at all the other entries!!</p>\n<p>The game is available free in-browser as an interactive Twine story or as a downloadable TTRPG-style PDF for a small tip. If you choose the latter you'll need a way to write a few things.</p>\n<p>Play, enjoy, share, comment, tell your friends you love them.<br/></p>\n<p>CWs: Potential unreality, very mild body horror</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T14:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca9/ca96148b8fffe478e90ec1428cb5e311.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mothworks"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
