{"id": 92136, "slug": "solarcolony", "name": "SolarColony", "name_original": "SolarColony", "description": "<p>This game is my submission for the LibGDX game jam. Due to a lack of time, it is more a prototype than a final game, but you can play it anyway :)</p>If you want to learn about the development of this game, have a look at the DevLog:<ul><li>on itch.io</li><li>or on infectedbytes.com<br/></li></ul><p>The source code is available at GitLab.</p><p><strong>The Game</strong></p><p>You are the owner of a small space station, orbiting a gas giant. In order to keep your people alive, you have to mine resources, increase your station and have a steady supply of oxygen, food and water. </p><p>Things aren't easy, so you have to manage the storage space carefully. If your storage is filled up with CO2 and there's no space left for oxygen, your people will suffocate. </p><p>But don't worry, if people die, you can create new ones through the cloning facility (if you have one...). <br/>But that will cost you some biomass and other resources.</p><p><strong>Getting started</strong></p><p>First of all, every space station needs storage for gases, liquids, solids and energy. If a storage is full, your machines stop producing! So make sure that you have always enough space.</p><p>Most buildings will cost metal and electronics, but some will need a bit more, like plastic. To get metal, you need a <em>Meteor Collector</em>, which will produce rocks. The <em>Rock Crusher</em> can use those rocks to produce metal and silicon. <br/>To generate electronics, you need a <em>Circuit Factory</em>. It will then generate electronics out of silicon and plastic. But how do we get plastic? Plastic is generated by the <em>PlasticGen</em>, which will in turn need again other things...</p><p>So as you can see, you have a lot to do. At the beginning it might happen that your people will die pretty fast, so I guess, you will have to reload a lot of savegames ;)</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Everything can be done with a mouse. You select something in the menu and place it via a left click. If you're done with placing, you can make a right click to deactivate the selected tool. </p><p>To move the camera you just hold the middle mouse button down and move around. Just like in Blender or Gimp. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a1/3a1b9ca574025507aa07ed37ed4bf2c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["InfectedBytes"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
