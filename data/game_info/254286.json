InferiorFPS is a Mobile First Person Shooter game created in Unity based around tournaments, events, and a safe experience. Once we have the basic functionality of the game, over time we will implement new things, such as clans, the tournament system, in-game currency, and weapon skins, remember to stay tuned for more updates regarding the game, soon I will have some screenshots out. Luckily to increase the development of the game, we have purchased an asset which already has the basic FPS functionality. Now we will add onto it and make the experience better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3266951eff0bb73530af7befa7dda3f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["iQueso"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
