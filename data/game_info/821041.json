He can bring back some order by repairing his quantum equaliser, but he has only ever lasted 2 minutes and 32 seconds.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible. Random events chosen by the dice will stack on top of each other until you rebuild the Quantum Equalizer, at which point all current effects will be cleared.</p>\n<p>You can use a keyboard or a controller. Use WASD/arrow keys/analogue stick to move, and space/(A) to jump.\u00a0</p><p>The music for this game was made by my good friend Cheesebite.</p><p>Here is\u00a0The Album.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T05:38:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/257/257a1be932d4d952f04133fa54aaa364.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pelengo"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
