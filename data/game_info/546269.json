{"id": 546269, "slug": "run-and-gun-rustbucket71", "name": "Run and Gun (rustbucket71)", "name_original": "Run and Gun (rustbucket71)", "description": "<p>This is the prototype version of my first VR game.<br/>Name is subject to change when I finally think of something better. <br/>I am taking suggestions...seriously.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Use the \"A\" button on the right controller to interact with menus.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Anyway, it is so named because you are running forward automatically and shooting things that get in your way. By things I mean static red guys that look menacing but don't really do much. But you do get points when you shoot them and they explode in gibby goodness so there's that.\u00a0 Also, grab all the coins you can along the way, because more points = higher score! And of course ammo, because a gun is no fun without ammo. (no you can't throw it....yet...)<br/></p>\n<p>I suggest you\u00a0 don't run into the bad guys or any other orange or red obstacle. Hit anything and it's game over. Duck, lunge, shoot and generally get your heart rate up trying to beat your last score. Keep moving and the score keeps increasing.<br/></p>\n<p>You can think of this game as a poor man's Pistol Whip (I swear I came up with the idea by myself long before I ever heard of that <em>other </em>game). I think there's good potential for more random level parts, enemies that actually act like enemies, barriers you can shoot out of the way and much more but I wanted to see if anyone else out there feels like it has the potential I do.\u00a0 Sometimes making a game in isolation can do funny things to your view of reality. <br/></p>\n<p>I would love feedback, encouragement, hate mail and the like. And if there's nothing but tumbleweeds and the sound of crickets well then I guess I know there's <strong>no</strong> interest in my little project. It's okay, I'll get over it. This heart will heal in time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e40/e401b338bc6bb428a3d0afd751ee421c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["rustbucket71"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
