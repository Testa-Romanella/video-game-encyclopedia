Packed with whimsical settings and eccentric characters, this energetic, challenging title brings an exciting take to old-school gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe story begins when our hero, a young earthling, is transported to a distant planet. After facing sudden assault from the world's inhabitants, he soon finds out that his arrival is no coincidence. What he learns sets him off on a mission to prevent the annihilation of the planet - and the subsequent conquest of earth - by a nefarious alien mastermind. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world's terrain ranges from the grassy to the mountainous to the aquatic to the mechanical. From rope swings to grappling hooks, there is no shortage of new tools you can discover to aid you in your progress.  And if the ability to punch your enemies' lights out isn't enough, you can also collect ammunition - your own personal arsenal of pocket bombs.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou are the only human who has the power.  You are the culmination of years of alien experimentation. You are THE FINAL SPECIMEN.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/466/4666f8b6a3cad4e77c57777a7240583c.jpg", "website": "http://www.thefinalspecimen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gigantoraptor Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Video Game Music Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
