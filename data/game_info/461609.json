With no way to run or fight, you must dodge the slimes, but they just keep coming!</p>\n<p>In this rhythmic skill game, you'll need to learn how each slime behaves and counter accordingly. Each color of slimes has a different pattern and timing. You'll need to think fast and act precisely.</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Z - Jump<br/>C - Crouch<br/>F - Fullscreen<br/>R - Restart<br/>ESC - Pause</p>\n<p>Slime list:</p>\n\n<p>Red Slime\u00a0- These pesky critters will charge you nonstop from one side to the other. At least you can jump and they can't.<br/>Blue Slime\u00a0- The blue slimes bounce through the caves. You better crouch when you see one!<br/>Yellow Slime\u00a0- A bit smarter than their red cousins, they'll take a good look at you before charging. Watch their timing!<br/>Green Slime\u00a0- Less bouncy, but trickier, they will stop for a bit before jumping at you, don't be a fool! Pay attention to the other slimes and crouch at the right time.<br/>Multicolor Slime\u00a0- If you don't know which color the slime is, then pay attention to their movements; if they do a little hop, they'll jump, if they don't, they'll charge.
