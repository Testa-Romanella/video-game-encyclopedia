Dodge your way through the ever changing rooms of the temple to get the treasure. Or that would be the concept, but the color based room modifiers that can be chained together for increased score kinda didn't make it into the game. We overplanned a bit. Oh well... It's still fun so have fun playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T11:47:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3e/e3e5f12e51fe71a7b63b052263bb5398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Polyak Attila"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
