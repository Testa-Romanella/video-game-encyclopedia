The loudest sirens he had ever seen. He knows he has done what he cannot come back from, but that does not matter to him. All he cares about is escaping. To begone of these fowl shackles he was born into. With him is his partner in crime. His accomplice. His lover. Although they do not know the concept of love, they had a connection stronger than steel. They were family more than they could have ever known. He grips their hand with a strength he didn\u2019t know he had, pulling them along. Using all of the willpower he had left to get out of this place. Knees weak, eyes ablur from tears. He wrestled with himself to put one foot in front of the other. He keeps pushing. At the end of this corridor is freedom, behind him was a fate worse than death. This was it.\u00a0 He slams the door open, inside was a pearlescent white spaceship, the same color as the rest of the world he once knew. He and his partner struggle, but manage to get the ship open. Everything inside of it was unknown to them, but through sheer willpower and determination they manage to start the ship and open the pressurized hanger. They were being shot at by lasers and real bullets. This was their only chance. The ship falls out backwards and pushes forward away from the planet. Away from the only place they ever knew.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T08:20:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74a168f832968c3980ba98e8b7fd046d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Raccoon Formality"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
