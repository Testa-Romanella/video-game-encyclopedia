In this challenging game, you are a spaceship in an arena. There is an escape and the only way to open it is collecting all the crystals in the level. After you reach the exit, you are release in a harder level. But don't be a fool!! Badies will spawn, trying to destroy you.After the hundredth level, the game randomly generate itself. So, in theory, the battle end only when you die.
