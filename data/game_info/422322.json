I was the lead programmer and designer, and I worked with Adam Campbell [Lighting and misc. tasks], Tien Dao [3D Modeler/Animator and Voice acting], and Phil Darnowsky [Programmer, Audio and website].</p>\n\n<p>This is a very unusual project so it requires a good deal of explanation.\r\nSpicy Boiz is a two-player cooperative puzzle game. This game was inspired by the likes of QWOP and Surgeon Simulator, so the controls are supposed to be difficult to understand. Its difficulty and challenge come from the controls. They are clunky on purpose.\r\nThis project can safely be considered in its alpha stage, and we did not have time to include every detail we wanted. As a result, some of the tasks required to win the game are not as clear as we would like. The instructions section contains a short walkthrough of the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>\r\nWindows PC that can run builds of Unity projects\r\n2 Players\r\n1 XBox controller</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>\r\nThis project centers around two demons occupying a single body. As such, this is a two-player game using only one controller.\r\nThe two players must sit side-by-side and each use one half of the controller, the player sitting on the left holding the left half of the controller with their left hand, and the player sitting on the right holding the right half of the controller with their right hand.\r\n1. To skip the intro cinematic, press \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018down\u2019 on the d-pad.\r\n2. Place the green brown of alcohol on the shelf in the starting room into the green sphere on top of the bottle of communion wine, which can be found at the base of a pillar in the room you start in.\r\n3. Place all three pages of the Necronomicon onto the book on the altar.\r\n4. Place every one of the crosses found in the church upside-down on the walls.\r\n5. Baptize the babies by throwing them into the moving basins in the baptism minigame.\r\n6. If you get stuck, you may need to quit the application (by pressing \u2018escape\u2019 on the keyboard) and restart it.\r\n7. If you fall over too many times, or you miss too many times during the baptism mini-game, you will lose.</p>\n<p>This is far from my most polished project. I had never worked with Unity3D before, none of my teammates had any video-game programming experience, and the game was completed in a very short timeframe. That being said, I am very proud of this project, and I think it is a great representation of my creativity.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T04:21:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf34a6ec3a73ecd8e301f8217a5959a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nate Smith"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
