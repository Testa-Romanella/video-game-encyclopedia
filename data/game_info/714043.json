{"id": 714043, "slug": "whiteboard", "name": "Whiteboard", "name_original": "Whiteboard", "description": "<p>Welcome to Whiteboard, Alter Learning's virtual multiplayer voice classroom environment. This conventional and endlessly configurable educational setting allows educators to parameterize the classroom seating arrangements and design interactable content to compliment lesson materials. An interactive 'whiteboard' surface helps for communicating ideas and equations in real-time.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>WebGL:</strong></em>\u00a0Use the\u00a0 Arrow keys to navigate Left and Right through the scene to view the 3D\u00a0environments that can be explored presently in VR.\u00a0The WebGL build has very limited interactability, but it does provide some insight into the project's development and introduces the user to elements of the VR experience that are immersive with the aid of\u00a0VR hardware (such as the Quest 2 build, which is available for download on this page below).\u00a0Click and hold the\u00a0M1 mouse button (default left-click button) to look around the room.\u00a0Use the the directional arrows on your keyboard to move forward, backward, and side to side.\u00a0\u00a0The WebGL build allows individuals with a desktop computer to open the scene and explore the environments that we have created for a Virtual Reality experience. You can walk around the indoor and outdoors spaces, but functionality is limited in the WebGL format.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><em><strong>Quest 2:</strong></em>\u00a0You spawn inside a home study room.\u00a0Press the \"X\" button on the left controller to open an avatar selection screen and a selection screen for\u00a0the Whiteboard environment. Choose your avatar, then look to your left and select the classroom to join. Each classroom supports up to\u00a020 players at a time, which is indicated by the\u00a0numbers on the lower right corner\u00a0of the environment's title image. Once the user selects\u00a0a classroom they will\u00a0be asked to\u00a0<strong>Connect with a Name,\u00a0</strong>then prompted\u00a0to\u00a0enter a\u00a0username that will appear\u00a0above their\u00a0avatar. The user enters their preferred username using\u00a0the hand controls\u00a0then taps\u00a0\u00a0<strong>Enter</strong> to join the selected classroom.\u00a0Alternatively, the user can\u00a0<strong>Connect Anonymously\u00a0</strong>and spawn directly into the selected\u00a0classroom.\r\nOnce inside the classroom the user is free to move around with the Lefthand Thumbstick. Use the \"A\" and \"X\" buttons on the controllers to pickup the markers and use them to interact with the whiteboard. Other users can join the class and the users can interact together to visually communicate their ideas with each other.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T12:02:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91b/91bd6988f3dc6e65a9d12511188c817d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AlterLearning"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
