All you can see are the feet of your character as they engage with the feet of others. As the game progresses, your worldview begins to expand - escalating the possibilities for interaction within the environment.</p>\n<p>This game was made during the 2018 SA Game Jam by Benjamin Crooks, Laura Seal and Andrea Hayes. It won the diversity and the narrative prizes. This game is still a prototype! We are aware that there are a few bugs.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:08:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd2f792bf8e63d52e583ee6211cda772.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Andrea Hayes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
