Press the R key to enter rewind mode and then use the scroll wheel to travel backward and forward in time (use the shift key to freeze the entity in place again), and then press the R key again to exit the rewind mode for the entity to move again normally. The player character will be unaffected by enabling rewind mode but I plan in the future to improve on this code to have the player freeze in place. I have a small obstacle course set up\u00a0too. There are still minor problems with the code (there is currently not a limit to how much data is recorded when an entity is rewound so don't leave the game running, and exiting in and out of rewind mode can cause problems when causing the entities to rewind).\u00a0 Neither the less enjoy and make sure too leave some feedback (It would be much appreciated if you did)! Also sorry if the camera is quite sensitive.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-29T09:55:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97a/97ad5a1a96cc74d6b73835430eaeac25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hammy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
