It is made with the purpose of learning about game development, pixel art\u00a0and Unity and it is my first finished game.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to land on the platforms, smaller platforms and careful landings give the most point. You use space and\u00a0the left and right arrows to control the lander. There is three spots, the\u00a0red and orange balls, that give you extra fuel and you get to continue you mission \u00a0as long as you have fuel left.<br/></p>\n<p>I study game development at The Indie Quest\u00a0(at Spelkollektivet, a house full of\u00a0game developers in Sweden) where Matej Jan is my teacher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The font in the game is Renew\u00a0made by Sam Keddy and the color palette is APOLLO made by AdamCYounis and I found it at Lospec.</p>\n<p>Please let me know your high score in the comments! :D</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T07:38:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fb/5fb3ed78fc81354ad94b38249c6d1f95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rymdlingen"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
