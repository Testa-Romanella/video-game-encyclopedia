Once it teleports, it can only affect YOU. Dash to avoid incoming fireballs. When you dash, you will be invincible for half a second. Every few seconds a water bucket spawns. You can\u00a0pick it up to shoot a waterball. Waterballs are bigger, faster, and can go through anything, but they only destroy fireballs\u00a0and only exist for a short while. Make sure no enemies leave the screen, otherwise the level restarts. Kill the enemies to move to the next level!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T23:18:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f0/2f0e188fbcab95cea6c8e2d32e918e68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xerro"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
