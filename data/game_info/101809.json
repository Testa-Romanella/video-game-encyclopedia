Experience the joy of uncovering a\u00a0solution, then\u00a0demonstrate your mastery\u00a0by finding the most efficient paths.</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The only objective is to move all the large blue tiles to the small blue tiles.\u00a0Use the arrow keys and spacebar to build a list of moves and interactions. Once you hit enter, the player will step through and perform each action in the queue.</p>\n<p>Keep your eye out for different tiles. Each color has its own behavior and can either help you reach your goal or keep you from continuing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Move<br/>Spacebar\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Interact<br/>Enter\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Execute Queue</p>\n<p>Backspace\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Restart Level<br/>Escape\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Return to Level Select<br/>Mouse\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Select Level<br/>Q\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zoom In/Out<br/>WASD\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Move Camera</p>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>For Windows, there is an installer that will ensure you have all the dependencies you need. In addition to the installer, there is a downloadable zip file that contains an executable. Either of them should work, it will just come down to your preference.</p>\n<p>For MacOS, there is a known issue that forces users to download the zip file, extract it, then simply move the executable to a different location on your machine. After relocating, the game should run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please reach out if you have any issues.\u00a0</p>\r\nFeedback\r\n<p>Queue by Queue is a programming sandbox that I have loved working on, and I would like to keep adding features over the next few months. Here are some of the things I\u00a0have planned...</p>\n<ul><li>Level editor for user generated puzzles</li><li>Scoring system on input time and number of actions</li><li>Improved camera and viewport options</li><li>Music variety (currently provided by Gravity Sound)</li><li>Better overworld</li><li>Colorblind settings</li><li>Additional tiles</li><li><strong>More levels</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>The current state of this game is extremely basic. I wanted to release a handful of levels as quickly as possible to ensure\u00a0development of this game is on the right path. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on improvements or expansions that could be made. I encourage you to either leave a comment or reach out to me at thebuffed@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>I hope that someone will enjoy the game as much as I\u00a0have!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ee/6ee1de2c76b869a45eefa8703130db77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TheBuffED"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
