Press and hold the water\u00a0 icon at the top right to spawn water. There is a limited amount of water that can be spawned (so\u00a0 the game doesn't crash and levels and\u00a0\u00a0 so levels aren't\u00a0<em>\u00a0 \u00a0too</em>\u00a0 \u00a0cheese-able). Your goal is to get water from the\u00a0 pipe on the left to the pipe on the right.\u00a0 \u00a0If water clips through any of the pipes, don't worry that's not your fault it's just a bug (only place I know this happens is sometimes at the very end of level 5). There are usually a few different solutions to the puzzles, but if you find yourself only barely getting a few droplets into the end pipe, try editing your solution a little so that less water escapes or it has an easier path. Not sure how much I like the fact that can happen, but wasn't sure of a good way to combat that.</p>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<p>Was the game actually fun to play? At the start of making this I felt like I took Where's My Water and subtracted the fun element, digging. But after adding sounds and more unique levels I thought it was a lot better. What are your thoughts?</p>\n<p>Also did you find a way to cheese any levels or solve them in a way that didn't seem intended?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T10:14:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8b/a8b2b7a38759dc9382a47ffb45c44b7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hutchid6"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
