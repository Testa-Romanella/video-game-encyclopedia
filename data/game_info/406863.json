You are one of these specimens, and Second Chance Inc. is given you the opportunity to restart your population.</p>\n<p>However, you first have to prove that this rebirth will not fail as a result of the same weakness that destroyed you in the first place.</p>\r\nCommunication is key(s)\r\n<p>The recommended way to play this game is\u00a0<strong>with a friend</strong>. Open your favourite chat program between you two and each start the game. The game does not require an internet connection, so feel free to use postal mail, telegrams, or pigeons (though it might slow you down a bit).</p>\n<p>If no friends are available (or worse: drop out halfway), there is a friendly chatbot built into the game who can take up this role.
