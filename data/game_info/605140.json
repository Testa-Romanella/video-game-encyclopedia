All forms of depression can\u00a0cause a severe lack of energy in those afflicted with it. Get ready for the day and be careful about the amount of energy you exert. You only have so much.</p>\n<p><strong><em>THIS IS A DEMO/ WORK IN PROGRESS!!</em></strong></p>\n<p>The ideal way to play <em>step</em> is to not click through the pauses. That is to say- when a text box appears, click to move to the next screen. When a menu appears, select the option you want to choose. Beyond that, however, do not click the screen. There will always be another option that comes up on its own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Be aware this game has no explicit trigger warnings, but a content warning for severe depresession and poor mental health is applicable.\u00a0<strong>Please also read the About section before beginning to play.</strong></p>\n<p>This game is available for both PC (Windows) and Mac.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>BE AWARE</strong>:\u00a0I, personally, struggle with severe depression, severe anxiety, and moderate-to-severe\u00a0OCD; I am also a graduate student. This means progress on this game will be incredibly so<strong><em> if</em></strong> I am ever able to complete it.
