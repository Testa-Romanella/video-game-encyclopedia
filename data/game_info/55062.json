It was developed for multiple platforms including DOS, Atari ST and Amiga. The game utilizes Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI0), resulting in a graphic style similar to its immediate predecessor, as well as a larger repertoire of MIDI music.</p>\n<p>This installment abandons the linear progression of series predecessor Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places) in favor of the dating sim aspects of the original title. The plot follows series protagonist Larry Laffer, fresh from an abrupt divorce, as he combs through a tropical resort looking for love.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ba/2ba1f40ef0ed8c640de799fa57a45d6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 9, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 11, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line", "Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
