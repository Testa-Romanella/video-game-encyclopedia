Use your wit and the power of zero gravity physics to get him back to his ship!</p>\n<p>In Version 1.4, in addition to the Normal Difficulty, we've introduced a Hard Mode that has a longer travel distance, the\u00a0<strong>Extinguisher Juice</strong> depletes faster, and there are more obstacles to run into.</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for #GMTKJam2020, and probably won't be updated further, but please stayed tuned for our next project.<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Space/Left Mouse: Release <strong>Extinguisher Juice</strong><br/>Mouse: Aim <strong>Nozzle</strong><br/>ESC:\u00a0Pause</p>\n<p>It's that simple.</p>\n\n<p>Staff Credits:<br/><br/>Programming: Andrew Jacobson<br/>3D Art Assets: Will Roberts<br/>Music and SFX: James Rogers<br/>Project Management: Lucas Goodwin<br/>Social Media and Pages: Brett Wilson</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c7142790666263933588b488913ea94a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Good Vybe"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
