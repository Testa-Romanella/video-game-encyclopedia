Type animal names to summon them, and they will attack the enemy\u2019s spawns and ultimately the enemy summoner himself. The first to kill the other one wins, as these things usually are.</p><p>You can type up to three animal names in a row, which spawns a totem of these three animals. Each animal has its own stats : speed, attack power, health and intelligence. The totem is as intelligent as its most intelligent member, and health is summed up, but movement speed is averaged.</p><p>If someone spawns a dog on the playfield, nobody can spawn another dog until it dies. No duplicate animal! Thankfully you have 284 animal names to choose from, 100 of which are illustrated differently.</p>\n<p>The game has a half-assed single-player mode that you can access by typing \u201cLOCAL\u201d in the connection screen. Otherwise, the game should work fine in LAN and over the Internet, as long as you open up the server\u2019s port 10000 (I\u2019m not sure whether Unity networking uses TCP or UDP, so go for both). The connection screen lets you know your LAN and WAN IPs as you host the game.</p><p>Things you can also enter at the connection prompt : \u201cMUTE\u201d to kill the music, \u201cIDDQD\u201d for degreelessness mode, and one other secret code which will be revealed elsewhere on the interwebs!</p><p>For more information about the commands you can enter on the splash screen, see\u00a0Devine\u2019s wiki page on Diluvium.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f99cf7e08faf148ee271a06fd1b17c07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Renaud B\u00e9dard"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
