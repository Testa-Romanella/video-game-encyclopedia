You must use this in your favor, and use the recoil of the gun to fly through the zero-gravity space station!</p>\n<p>Controls: WASD or Arrow\u00a0Keys to shoot. Collect crystals, and avoid the aliens!</p>\n<p>Made in Game\u00a0Maker Studio.</p>\n<p>Sounds made in BFXR.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33c/33c33595c774673ccb133b6b8f9f2abc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jesscapade"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
