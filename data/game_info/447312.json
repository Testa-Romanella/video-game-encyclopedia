{"id": 447312, "slug": "create-a-chao", "name": "Create a Chao", "name_original": "Create a Chao", "description": "<p>This is the first game I made on my own.\u00a0 I like playing character maker games and I love Chao, so I thought it would be fun to make a Chao maker game!</p>\n<p>This was a LOT of work, especially since I had to learn a lot of stuff in the process and spend time fixing mistakes and adding things I missed. The game includes 1,509 images, 192 buttons, and 594 events! But it was totally worth it!<br/></p>\n<p>Timeline: I thought of the idea for this game while playing with my Chao sometime late in 2019. I made the artwork (aside from the title screen which was made later) from December 26, 2019-January 20, 2020. I had to put the project on hold for a few months after that while I waited to buy a game-making program. Then I worked on the game from April 28-May 21, 2020.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits: I do NOT own Chao, Sonic, or any related elements. The artwork and game were all made by me. I used PaintTool SAI for the art, Clickteam Fusion 2.5 for the game, and Chao Island's gallery for reference images.<br/></p>\n<p>Note: I know there are some types, colors, and accessories I did not add. This is because there was already a huge amount of images and events in the game. I added some extra accessories and backgrounds for fun, though! Unfortunately there are some layer issues with the Chaos Chao so some accessories don't look right on them. My apologies!</p>\n<p>Have fun playing this cute free game! And if you want to save your Chao, try taking a screenshot (print screen button in Windows), paste it into an image editing program, and crop it. I'd love to see your creations!</p>\n<p>-Multi<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T03:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/32684de8f7af897cbdfcfc4dcdc54ca4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Multifavs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
