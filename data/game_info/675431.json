Listen, we'll make it this time, I promise. It's a basic stew, how hard can it be? The recipe looks so plain I'm tempted to add a few more ingredients just to spice things up\".</em></p>\n<p><strong>Story</strong>: it's cooking time! Violet hasn't been too lucky with her culinary exploits lately, not really. Pots blowing up, houses burning down, chthonic interdimensional beings rampaging in the oven... that kind of stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>People asked, people <em>begged</em> Violet to stop risking it altogether, or at least consult with a chef's cookbook first, and... she actually complied!\u00a0But not before introducing a few tiny changes into the recipe. Cooking is art, and all art requires courage!</p>\n<p>***\r\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Keep\u00a0</strong>your cooking pot stable and balanced!\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</li><li><strong>Add\u00a0</strong>new ingredients to enhance the taste!\r\n</li><li><strong>Avoid\u00a0</strong>overusing any one particular element!\r\n</li><li><strong>Complete\u00a0</strong>your dish in just two hellish minutes!\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>***\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: mouse only.
