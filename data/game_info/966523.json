{"id": 966523, "slug": "memory-patches", "name": "Memory Patches", "name_original": "Memory Patches", "description": "A visual short novel about a girl who wakes up in an empty apartment and tries to figure out what happened. In front of her are four boxes filled with different items from her past. Touching them, she recalls pieces of memories, but one of the items is cursed. The beginning of the game introduces the classic novel mechanic of choosing answers. The player must press \"Next\" to progress through the story.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen boxes appear or the apartment is examined, the player has to make additional choices using buttons that will lead him back to the table where the boxes are.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhen examining the caskets, the player is presented with up to seven button choices and a return back if each item is examined. Some of the caskets can only be viewed once, and it is not possible to go back to the previous casket.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the final section, the player has three buttons, and must choose correct answers to get to the blue ending, or incorrect answers to get to the red ending. The answers are descriptions of the items in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game is controlled with the mouse.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-18T04:25:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df6/df61ae438a16f857890412537327418f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["STuNT"], "esrb_rating": null}
