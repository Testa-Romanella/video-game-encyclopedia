Hit your opponents with balls to remove lives. Only one can survive.</p>\n<p>Each arena is different, powerups force you to think on your feet, and unique ball types keep games varied.</p>\n<p>Players can control their throw <strong>power</strong> (by holding longer) and <strong>curve</strong> (by rotating). To make matters worse, players can perform dashes and tackles ...</p>\n<p>Playable by anyone who just wants some fun, but enough strategy and skill to stay interesting.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game is playable on <strong>Windows/Mac/Linux</strong> with any combination of keyboard and controllers. It supports <strong>2-4 players</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>To play the game, you only need two controls \u2014 move around and throw the ball \u2014 making it accessible to anyone!</p>\n<p>Mastering the game however, with all its weird ball types and curving shots, will take time. (And some more buttons, if you want to.) <br/></p>\r\nThe 1-week challenge\r\n<p>I love local multiplayer games. However, I tend to make projects TOO BIG, so I challenged myself to develop tiny ideas in just a week.</p>\n<p>This is the third game made via this challenge. Below are links to the other games:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Recipe for Disaster</li>\n<li>I Wish You Good Hug</li></ul>\n<p>So yeah, this game was made in a week. It's fully finished, playable, and tested, but obviously has a limited scope.<br/></p>\n<p>This game started with the simple idea: \"what if I just create the game of dodgeball (which most people know from high school)?\"</p>\n<p>In the end, because of the limited time frame, I wasn't able to create an extra mode that actually follows the common \"rules\" for dodgeball. Instead, there is only one \"free-for-all mode\". Additionally, after creating the whole game, I'm pretty certain it would've worked better in 3D. So I might still make that.</p>\n<p>And ... well, this is awkward. The idea of \"totems\" barely made it into the game. I wanted to make the whole art style based on totems, but soon realized I didn't know how to make it look good (in 2D, drawing complex totems from all directions) within the limited time I had. So the updated version (in 3D) will probably actually follow the theme.<br/></p>\n<p>So this is the wishlist for version 2.0 (which will be another One Week Game):<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Fully 3D (although lots of art/graphics can be copied of course, like the UI)</li><li>Extra modes that make it more like the real-life dodgeball or a \"sport\"</li><li>Bots to play against and ability to team up</li><li>Even more arenas and special rules to enable/disable. Maybe an extra button/mechanic?</li></ul>\n<p>For my full thoughts about this game and the development, read the devlog on my blog: Totems of Tag: What I've Learned\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-30T08:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dab/dab8b005783a5f71ed391e9824685408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
