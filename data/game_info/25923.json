{"id": 25923, "slug": "crystal-defenders-r2", "name": "Crystal Defenders R2", "name_original": "Crystal Defenders R2", "description": "<p>\n      In CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R2, you must deploy various units, such as Fencers \n      and Black Mages, to stop waves of encroaching monsters from escaping the \n      area with your party's crystals. There are many types of units to choose \n      from: some specializing in powerful short-range attacks, some wielding \n      far-reaching magicks, and still others equipped with bows, enabling them \n      to bring down aerial foes. Deploy units in strategic locations to take \n      full advantage of their traits. Each time an enemy breaches your \n      defenses and reaches a map's exit, your party will lose crystals. When \n      all your crystals are gone, the game is over. R2 offers several new, \n      challenging maps containing multiple entrances and exits. It also \n      introduces three varieties of Power Crystals, allowing you to enhance \n      the abilities of your units, while new jobs, including Flintlock and \n      Tinker, set the stage for even more complex strategies. Can you defend \n      all the maps without losing a single crystal?\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
