I had a cat named Safira, and at the time I used to spend a lot of time working on my projects in RPG Maker. Safira was always with me in my room, and sometimes I had some talk with her about my projects and what to do next in my games. Of course she didn't answer back, but it was nice to have her around. That's why I had an idea to make a RPG Maker game for her, and that's how I started this project.</p>\n<p>2011 was the year I finally finished it, and a decade ago there was not many places where I could upload my games, so I never showed it to other people. But now is different, and I decided to upload the game exactly the way it was back then. All I did was to fix some small bugs and typos, as english is not my mother language.</p>\n<p>In the game, you control Safira, a cat who lives in the forest with all her cat friends. One day, a misterious man appeared and kidnap all cats, except for Safira, who was sunbathing in a waterfall near the cat village. She decides to pursue the man in order to save her cat friends, who are now trapped inside treasure chests. Safira will need to go trough a lot of different places to save all her friends, solving a lot of puzzles in her way. Can you save all the\u00a0 cat friends and defeat the cat kidnapper?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T08:28:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf3ef1c008744ab7ad992c308e96cc1b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolonWise"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
