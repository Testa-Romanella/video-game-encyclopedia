This is the first game I've ever made on my own, with my first time making every possible asset\u00a0(yes.. I apologize for the music not matching the theme.. and well the whole game's assets\u00a0in general). The project was made for game programming fundamental practice. Throughout most of the development,\u00a0 there was no intention to have my game\u00a0played by the public. However, I\u00a0feel that it's important to have my first work \"out there\", even if it's a pile of poo. Thanks for checking it out!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Almost all of the game was developed on stream at : https://twitch.tv/yammzlol\u00a0and has been mainly inspired by Starcraft.</p>\n<p>- CONTROLS -</p>\n<p>Left Click to select units/buildings<br/>Right Click to send unit to destination or attack unit/building</p>\n<p>QWE and ASD to build Units and Buildings</p>\n<p>CTRL + any number(1-5)\u00a0 to add selected units/buildings to a control\u00a0group</p>\n<p>Y to disable tips<br/>U to disable music</p>\n<p>Game too easy? Try pressing O for Hard mode and P for an even harder mode!</p>\n\n<p>-\u00a0TIPS -</p>\n<p>It's REALLY important that you make workers whenever possible,\u00a0and camps BEFORE you reach max supply.</p>\n<p>Don't stack up more than 150 wood at a time unless you're going for an armory upgrade, always be spending your resources!</p>\n<p>Once you have enough wood to build a Barracks, definitely do\u00a0so! You can make military units, used to defend from your enemies attacks.</p>\n<p>Multitasking was one of the most important aspects in Starcraft, it is here too! You have to be fast and keeping track of your buildings queue's always be making units!</p>\n<p>More barracks means more camps, more often! Once you have multiple barracks, you'll need to designate a worker or two to constantly make camps.</p><p>Selecting buildings or units and combining CTRL + 1 will add all selected units to the \"1\" key. You can do this with numbers 1-5, and can make multitasking less stressful.</p>\n<p>**The starter difficulty might be hard, don't give up!\u00a0Like in Starcraft, the main things to always be doing are making workers and building camps before you reach max supply. **<br/></p>\n<p>If you're having trouble and just want to feel the justice of\u00a0winning, you can try running your workers at the enemy's base\u00a0at the start of the game ;)\u00a0</p>\n<p>(definitely try to win the regular\u00a0way after :D )</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533527bdc3c13671e5db9c3389921183.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ErrorDroneGames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
