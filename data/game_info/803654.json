It's not much but if anyone has fun playing it then it will be worth all the hours I\u00a0sunk into it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Goal:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Defend the Ark (the big ship) from the Aliens. If you die, you'll respawn but if the Ark is destroyed its game over. There are a few different ship variants you can choose from so give them each a try. The game features a leaderboard to track your best scores so you can try to improve and do better each time.
