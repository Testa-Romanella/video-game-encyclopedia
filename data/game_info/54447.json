It is the first Mortal Kombat game to feature side-scrolling gameplay. It was released for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Mythologies is a prequel set prior to the events of the tournament in the original Mortal Kombat. The storyline centers on the warrior, Sub-Zero. In the story he is asked to find an amulet by the sorcerer Quan Chi. The player controls Sub-Zero in multiple stages as he faces multiple enemies trying to eliminate him.<br />\nThe PlayStation version features live-action cutscenes, but the Nintendo 64 version of the game replaced the live-action cutscenes with still images of such, due to limited storage space on the cartridge. The game has been panned by video game publications due to a poor transition from fighting games to an action-adventure genre and has been labeled as the 2nd worst Mortal Kombat game next to Mortal Kombat: Special Forces.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1997-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-02T02:48:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a8/0a8ca799dd7c7492c20528ce723dc1ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.88, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 23, "beaten": 20, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 37}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 42, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 22, "reviews_count": 42, "platforms": ["Nintendo 64", "PlayStation"], "developers": ["Midway Games", "Avalanche Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Midway Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
