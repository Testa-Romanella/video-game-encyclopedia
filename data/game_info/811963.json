I implemented the limitation of \"Health is a tool\" by grouping both health and stamina together into one bar. You can go at a normal speed to preserve health, or sacrifice health for a quick burst of speed to get away from predators. Plankton help restore your health/stamina and are a constant necessity on your way down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench! (I just realized I forgot to implement a victory screen! If you get to 11,054m you win)</p>\n<p>This is my very first original game that I've completed so\u00a0I'd appreciate any and all critiques and advice. This was a really fun project and I look forward to making many more! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:06:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3f8e262513008f91a57f2b414c7ca10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["macleodian"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
