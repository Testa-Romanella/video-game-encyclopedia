Take control of hosts, jumping from victim to victim as they try to stop your escape. Once in control, shoot-em-up until you find the next host. But be careful... if you run<strong><em> out of control, </em></strong>it's game over. <br/></p>\n<p>Everything costs <em><strong>control</strong></em>, a limited resource for your parasitic species. That means every time you make a host move or shoot, you're a bit closer to losing. <strong>Can you make it all the way out of the dungeon?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The theme for the GMTK Game Jam 2020 was \u00a0<strong><em>Out of Control</em><em>. </em></strong>In this game, every action you take brings you closer to losing control, until you end up completely powerless.</p>\n<p>I recommend downloading the Windows version if you can!
