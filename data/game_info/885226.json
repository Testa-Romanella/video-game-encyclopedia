To survive\u00a0you have to fight for what limited resources you can find.\"</em><br/></p>\n\n<p>In a world where electricity is at a price beyond comprehension, where droids like you have to steal and scrap together whatever they find - if they don't want to work endless hours as slaves - you find yourself with 20 seconds of battery power left. How will you spend them? Will you destroy yourself? Will you hibernate yourself? Will you try to escape? Or will you simply run out of power?</p>\n<p>Try to get each of the 5 endings (excluding the regular game over).</p>\n\n<p>Made for 9 game jams at once:<br/>AGBIC - game is based on the cartridge above<br/>Metroidvania Month - You explore an interconnected world with upgrades that open new paths; it's technically a metroidvania, just a very small one<br/>20 second game jam - Each game lasts only 20 seconds<br/>Bird jam - Top part of the map, and transcendence ending, contain birds<br/>Mushroom jam - Bottom part of the map contains glowing mushrooms<br/>Platformer challenge - Game contains crumbling platforms that disappear after you step off of them<br/>Late-stage capitalism - Kind of a big thing where electricity, and therefore the lives of conscious beings (droids), is under a strict price - droids are used for manual labor and easily discarded<br/>Abyssal's pixel game jam - Top half of the map is light and bottom half is dark; also, you get a flashlight that allows you to light up the darkness<br/>Bagel jam - There's a big bagel above the start and two boxes of bagels on the right side of the map</p>\n\n<p>Music used:</p>\n<p>Gameplay: \"Umspannwerk\" by cryptic scenery is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</p>\n<p>Hibernation ending: \"relajaci\u00f3n\" by San Crist\u00f3bal Orquesta is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 International License</p>\n<p>Origins ending: \"leche caliente\" by San Crist\u00f3bal Orquesta is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 International License</p>\n<p>Reincarnation ending: \"Spirals\" by Teeth Mountain is licensed under an Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</p>\n<p>Evacuation ending: \"\u00c1 Minuit, le 31 D\u00e9cembre\" by Monroeville Music Center is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License</p>\n<p>Shutdown ending: \"uh yeah\" by San Crist\u00f3bal Orquesta is licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 International License</p>\n<p>Main menu: \"Malamut\" by Teeth Mountain is licensed under an Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License</p>\n<p>Transcendence ending: \"Il Pleut des Informations (ou Mass Media en Masse \u00e0 Partir de Notre Cumulonimus Fiable)\" by Monroeville Music Center is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License</p>\n<p>Cartridge art (used in main menu) by Asher Eggleston</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T08:03:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44f/44f9c34988925bd5f54062d628b7c8a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["89o"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
