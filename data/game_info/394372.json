{"id": 394372, "slug": "explosimo", "name": "Explosimo", "name_original": "Explosimo", "description": "<p>In a time far far in the future where the earth is much older,\u00a0its core energy has almost depleted. To prevent earth from\u00a0dying slowly, a robot so called Explosimo comes into play. He lives in a small orbital station and is\u00a0designated to reach the core from heaven\u00a0through the mines. At the very bottom\u00a0Explosimo will be able to\u00a0infuse it with a massive blast of pure\u00a0energy and restore its full power again.<br/>Get down to earth and help Explosimo fulfill his mission.</p>\n<p>In this game you have to setup and manually detonate explosive barrels to move Explosimo through each stage. He cannot walk but is kind of indestructible. Use this to your advantage.<br/><br/>The controls are pretty simple. Left mouseclick on a reddish barrel, move the green arrow in the direction of the force and finish the action again with the left mouse button. It's possible to set the input keys for each barrel\u00a0manually but auto key\u00a0 layout\u00a0is recommended. Last but no least: slower is often\u00a0faster ;)<br/><br/>We always appreciate any feedback or comments! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T05:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/320b449ae5effd8447ca96782f8a47c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoodOlDevs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
