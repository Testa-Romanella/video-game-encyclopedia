More water in the reservoir creates more water pressure at the turbine, generating more electricity.\u00a0Use the spillway to prevent overtopping the dam. Try to anticipate the seasonal changes to the reservoir inflow, which is\u00a0highest in the late winter and\u00a0early\u00a0spring, and lowest in the summer.</p>\n<p>The demand for electricity is a score multiplier. Demand is higher in the summer and winter, and lower in the spring and fall.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T08:18:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbb/dbb98e113e597c082b3a924f287b0d4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gray Miniature Games"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
