{"id": 184540, "slug": "blocks-prototype", "name": "Blocks Prototype", "name_original": "Blocks Prototype", "description": "<p>Blocks is a physics-based, side-scrolling platformer-esque prototype game. Build as a group to advance in your journey.<br/><br/> It's a peculiar result... Ideally, we wanted to provide a compelling story without dialogue, aiming to leave impressions and questions with the player. The idea of controlling a group as our protagonist was intriguing, and we thought an overall focus on the principle of unity within a group was something worth trying out.<br/><br/>We aimed to make this a relatively short project, but we ended up catching scope creep and we struggled to plan the game the right side up. We made the mistake of setting everything up for how we <em>thought\u00a0</em>the game would work without actually having proven and working gameplay mechanics first, so a lot of the scene setups we had made have potentially gone to waste.<br/><br/>Hopefully you can enjoy our exploration, mess, and learning outcome and perhaps we'll revisit and see this idea to its full potential sometime in the future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5f8448956854dc31afa5163a1ba8260.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Puddygum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
