There is a global salt shortage on earth, and the last place with salt known to man is an interstellar gas station. You're part of a Belgian crew carrying humanity's last <strong><em>BELGIAN</em></strong> fries, which must not go cold before you find the salt. Right when you got the coordinates right, a French ship attacked you. The damage sustained caused the navigation system to go haywire. The ship AI will take you down dangerous paths\u00a0 to get to the gas station and you won't be able to avoid anything. The last bit of control you have is the defence system, whose systems have to be activated and used manually. Don't forget the French are still coming at you for these fries!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:28:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b82/b82b9724d096c7d03563ee90924e371f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueDM"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
