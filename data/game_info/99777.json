The maze itself is created by a growing tree algorithm, first generating the map walls and extending out into blockwise geometry. The bit maze is then converted into waves of bullets that cage in the player, contributing to my idea of BULLET HELL.<br/><br/>Made for fans of Shmups, Treasure, Gunstar Heroes, Radiant silvergun, Gradius V, Alien Soldier style boss patterns.  <br/><br/>WARNING - Giant enemy crabs have weak spots too.. and there are likely to be bugs due to a fast turnaround. Please treat this as a visual experiment rather than finished game, and it will be continuously developed in the next few months.<br/><br/>This is a small part of the final work in progress, the gameplay elements aren't fully developed and have been created for the purpose of the Jam. The final game will use the section in a very different way. And i'm looking forward to sharing that with you in the near future, but i do hope you enjoy, and check out the other Jam entries, and my other games.<br/></p><p>GT</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/875/875238e258b2b474ad51bd036253a1bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["grandtraindelta"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
