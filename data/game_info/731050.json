{"id": 731050, "slug": "_play", "name": "_PLAY", "name_original": "_PLAY", "description": "<p>A mini-puzzle game\u00a0that plays around with this year's Global Game Jam concept \"Duality\".<br/>The main concept is involving around controlling 2 objects that work opposite to each other so it turns out to be a\u00a0game about controlling the 2 pointers that mirror each other to solve to puzzle.<br/>With some twist with the rule\u00a0on each level making the core mechanic having much more possibility to explore on level design but unfortunately since the time on the jam\u00a0is short. I can only put on some of the major mechanics only and didn't have much time to combine each mechanic into more unique levels.<br/>I might be taking a look at this project later to make a post-jam version with some systems such as time-attack mode or life reduction.<br/>but in a meantime. I hope you guys will enjoy this mini puzzle game.<br/>Thanks<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T10:15:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aff/aff3fe898495e4c277d18a001accdc10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dragonitrix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
