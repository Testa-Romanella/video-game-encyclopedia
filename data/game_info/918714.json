I coded this in about 4 days. It's an arcade-like experience, loosely inspired by Disc Room and Pigments, but it takes that general game structure in a new direction. There's twelve different levels to try to survive in, each with their own obstacles, powers, and goals. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls should be explained in-game. Have fun playing, and good luck earning the highest medals!\r\n </p>\n<p>Thank you to Heracleum and the PICO-8 Discord with help optimizing the game's draw loop.\r\n<br/><br/>https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=51439</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T12:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/007/007a4ad593bba597a06f9df1eb7093d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["parchmentEngineer"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
