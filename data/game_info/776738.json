However, each \u201ccloud\u201d can only be stepped on once and every single one must be hopped on in order for the gate to open. As the level difficulty increases, more features are added that complicate the maze.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The overall theme of the game is inspired by Studio Ghibli\u2019s Totoro. With the main art style being pixel art, the overall visual aesthetic is very cute, lighthearted, and playful.\u00a0\r\n<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-29T08:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c5da2f2b24758a9676383f0fb3a849d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["anginguyen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
