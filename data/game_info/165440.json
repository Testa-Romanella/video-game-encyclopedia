Feel free to contact me if you do find any. In particular there is a known bug where if you switch between quests in the same play session (i.e. start quest 1, quit to the main menu and start quest 2) it won't properly remember your heroes/gold. I advise quitting and relaunching the game itself between quests. I\u00a0have not added support for any resolutions other than 1920 x 1080 (something I will definitely integrate from the start on my next project!).\u00a0</p><p>If after playing the game you would take a few minutes to fill out a short survey at\u00a0https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/F8K955N\u00a0I would be forever grateful. Also feel free to give me a follow on Facebook (Dr Ninja), Instagram (@iamdoctorninja), Twitter (@andrew_mendlik) or get in touch via email through andrewmendlik at gmail dot com.</p><p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Please note: Hero Quest and all it's graphics and designs are copyright 1989 Milton Bradley.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d4b/d4bbc60ef2fd6ca3723a7aafe4eee7b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DrNinja"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
