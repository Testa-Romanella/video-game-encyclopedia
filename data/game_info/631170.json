You're going to be a part of our band, starting today!\"</em><br/><br/></p>\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\n<p>Default RPGM2000 gameplay. Mostly talking, exploration, and whacking slimes.<br/>The game will take about an hour or two to complete, give or take. Not particularly difficult.</p>\r\nCHANGELOG<p>(2021/07/04) - Some minor bugfixes involving a sidequest in the forest not working properly and some tiles that shouldn't be passable being passable.

The game is playable online on this very page, but I recommend downloading it and playing it on your desktop instead. I have not tested the online version, so there may be bugs.<br/></p>\n<p>For those who have completed the game using the browser version, download the BONUS FOLDER on this page for some (as you may expect) bonus content! The password to this is the identity of the final boss (one word, three letters, all caps). Those who have downloaded the game itself will not need to download the bonus folder, as it is already included within the game zip.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you are having trouble solving some of the puzzles/can't be arsed to solve them, there is a handy collection of HINT AND ANSWER. Again, if you've downloaded the game, this should already be included with the game itself. Browser players will need to download and unzip this folder.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c0/6c0abcef0c302e90e6e0500753f266aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ojosama"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
