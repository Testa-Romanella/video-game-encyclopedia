We were exceptionally proud to rank\u00a0<strong>3rd in Graphics</strong> and\u00a0<strong>12th Overall</strong> in the LD47 Jam!\u00a0We really loved making the game and have decided to develop the card-game portion of the game further.<br/></p>\n\r\nCard Game Mechanics\r\n<p>A brief overview of the card game mechanics are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>The card combat pits two parties against one another.</li><li>Party members' identities come from the combination of their attributes (Power, Wisdom,\u00a0Luck and Vitality) along with their unique special ability.</li><li>Party members can only attack by utilising the cards laid out in the centre of the board, but those cards are face down.\u00a0</li><li>A party must spend Actions Points to reveal these cards, but\u00a0also spend action points to place a party member on the card in order to perform that cards action.\u00a0</li><li>The cards include a variety of attack cards, survival cards and special cards.\u00a0</li><li>At the end of the turn, used cards are replaced and\u00a0any unused cards are flipped back over.\u00a0</li><li>Memorising the placement of unused\u00a0cards placement will therefore help you, though fresh cards being added to the board each turn keeps your options open.</li></ul>\r\nOverarching Game-loop Mechanic\r\n<p>We have a lot of exciting ideas that will allow players to customise and tailor their party and their abilities as their adventure goes on. The card game is used to resolve combat situations, however your party persists between combat. The intended game loop would be that you set out for adventure, with a variety of paths you can take towards your adventure's destination. These will often involve fighting off enemies, but also will provide opportunities for a player to:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Find new party members</li><li>Recover health</li><li>Add or Remove cards from your deck</li><li>Acquire support cards and trinkets</li><li>Participate in chance-based events</li></ul>\n<p>The player will decide which routes to take; choose new cards to add to their deck after victory; decide which heroes will form your party of three.</p>\r\nDeck Building\u00a0\r\n<p>Each play through gives you a clean slate to work from. You'll be able build your party from a roster of available adventurers, but importantly - you'll be building your deck too. Your deck consists of the cards that are laid face-down during the card game, that in turn provide your characters with actions they can perform.\u00a0You will not build a deck prior to adventuring, but instead you will add to your\u00a0deck during your adventure.</p>\n<p>Successfully defeating enemies will reward you with a small selection of cards for you to choose from to add to your deck. Specific locations on the map or random chance events will also allow for cards to be added or removed from your deck. This allows the player to build a deck that suits their party composition, whilst attempting to synergise their card choices as they go. Building your own deck in this way allows players to sway the odds in their favour, increasing the odds of favourable cards being revealed during the card\u00a0game.<br/></p>Keep in touch<p>Join the other Cattenburgians on the community discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/ftmjCq2<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-06T05:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d55e83a55c4f7bc01bd3358046f710.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HonestDan"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
