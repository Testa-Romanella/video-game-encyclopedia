(Redmont Games)", "description": "<p>Don't shoot - or you might regret it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can shoot with left-click and move around with WASD.</p>\n<p>You start off in a room with two enemies. However, after shooting these enemies you might realise that it isn't quite that simple. Your bullets bounce indefinitely - and could end up being your own undoing. Once the bullets start bouncing\u00a0the walls\u00a0will also slowly crumble away and reveal even more enemies. You're faced with a choice: Do you simply try to avoid the enemies or\u00a0shoot them? If you're not careful, things could very quickly <strong>get out of control</strong>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T03:40:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/458/458572c26d7e1e221fb4e4781755698e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Redmont Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
