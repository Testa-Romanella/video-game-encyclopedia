The graphics and sound aren't the best as I was focused on gameplay and terrain generation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thoughts on final project (as part of the game jam):<br/></strong>Very happy with how the generation system and upgrade system came out. Just getting 12 unique items into the game within a jam is cool. Sadly I didn't get to more complex enemy placement in the generation code (enemies do not spawn outside of buildings right now) and I didn't get my exploding barrels in!</p>\n<p>Also enemy variety (outside of turrets) and enemy movement would have been nice to add.\u00a0And I needed more time for testing and tweaking the numbers (of enemy features, upgrades, etc.).</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0Push of the STRONG ONE!!! by Centurian\u00a0of War</p><p>https://opengameart.org/users/centurionofwar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T11:22:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/0667446a12d3a04746791d125509b99f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monday's Lunch"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
