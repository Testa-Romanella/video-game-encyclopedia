Players have to go through a procedurally generated dungeon fighting enemies on their way and a boss at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemies have assorted abilities that can vary and combine so that you have to invent peculiar tactics against each of them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nApart from melee and ranged weapons, players can use other ways to interact with enemies: they can be set on fire, slowed down, receive weaknesses to certain attacks, etc. There are also traps and obstacles that require the player's attention and reaction to be safely passed. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the process of exploration, players pick up weapons and weapon upgrades, consumables and craft supplies. Craft system allows players to create boosting supplies, ammo, traps for enemies, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are blessings that alter certain stats and abilities. Wisely combining them, you can receive additional effects. There are curses as well, that can be cast by enemies, come as trap events or act as side effects of particular items.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNB. Our hero is not a rabbit, as you may think, but a hare. Please pay attention to this fact as it will play an important part throughout the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T02:02:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e9/8e99ce3cc74c8fbab7fad52922aad76d.jpg", "website": "http://moonpubgames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 317, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Moon Pub Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Moon Pub Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
