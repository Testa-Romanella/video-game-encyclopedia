The objective of the game is to score points by creating groups of 4 or more tiles of the same kind using as few moves as possible. Each move adds to the tension meter, which creates an unusable fire tile when filled, and the game ends if two fire tiles ever meet.</p>\n<p>Instructions: Click on a tile to rotate the 6 tiles surrounding it. Right-clicking rotates clockwise, left-clicking rotates counter-clockwise.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-22T03:46:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/525/525f413b61b0c0a03956b8ecb30d5096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cbdevilla"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
