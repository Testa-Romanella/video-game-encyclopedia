{"id": 93780, "slug": "oral-perspectives", "name": "Oral Perspectives", "name_original": "Oral Perspectives", "description": "<p>Oral Perspectives is a virtual experience in which a user undergoes a series of situations that are both absurd and everyday. This primarily passive experience takes place from a visually, aurally and kinesthetically shifted perspective a few inches lower than the natural position, inside the user's oral cavity.</p>\n<p>Oral Perspectives is intended for use with the Oculus Rift Development Kit, microphone and a custom-jaw sensor. The jaw sensor provides extreme discomfort as the user is motivated to maintain an open jaw position in order to receive sensory data outside the mouth.</p>\n<p>The excessive, over-the-top nature of the visual experience paired with the newest virtual reality headset and uncomfortable head-mounted jaw sensor suggests a love/hate relationship with novelty and our need for it.</p>\n<p>Oral Perspectives was created with Unity in 2014. Assets were created in Blender, Adobe Photoshop and Audacity. A list of other assets can be found here.</p>\n<p>The current version works with the Rift DK1, with DK2 support being improved at the moment. For those without the jaw sensor and/or the Oculus Rift headset, there are options in the menu to turn off the functionality, although this is not recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Read the Kill Screen Feature!</p>\n\n\n<p>Playthrough by Matt Shea</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a0f/a0f5d2e228b0d7beb08aa558fc32ca5b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juno AM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
