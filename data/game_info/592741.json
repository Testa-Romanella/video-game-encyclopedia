Be ready to face off her heavy side spin services, and top-notch Federer style single-handed backhand. She's mighty and will play with you in 3 games for each match. As your progress, you will level up but your stamina will drain. Fear not though, power balls will come to your rescue as long rallies kick in!<br/><br/>The controls are easy, with two joysticks on both sides. One controls your movements in a 1st person angle, while the other one controls your racket swinging directions.<br/><br/>#Tennis offers point-of-view camera gameplay - giving you a sense of being in the court, yet not overly intense. So you don't have to stress out for a game. Perfect for casual fans and serious tennis lovers alike.<br/><br/>If you enjoy watching ITF tournaments, Wimbledon, US Open, Australia Open or Olympic tennis, you should be able to enjoy this game!<br/><br/>Have fun, good luck, and tell us what you think about #Tennis!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T10:51:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e6/3e63d80db44b67ba687c6f89d77c25a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Table Tennis Recrafted"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
