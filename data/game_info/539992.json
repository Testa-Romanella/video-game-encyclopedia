There are few exit panels you can extract and it will take 5 seconds to extract. Also, there are some AIs roaming around the area and you just need to beat them up and get the bounty right away.</p>\n\r\nSERVER CONFIG\r\n<p>{<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"maxPlayers\": 10,<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"maxAIs\": 1,<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"AIspawnTime\": 3.0,<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"port\": 28475,<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \"mapName\": \"Apartment\"<br/>}</p>\n\r\nSERVER COMMANDS\r\n<p>players - Shows a list of current online players.<br/>ban <param/>- Ban a player by using a player number from the command 'player'.<br/>unban <param/>- Unban a player by using banned IP.<br/>banlist <param/>- Shows a list of banned players.<br/>kick <param/>- Kick a player by using a player number from the command 'player'.<br/>report <param/>- Check status of reports on the player.<br/>reportlist- Shows a list of # reports on each players.<br/>stop - Stops the server. <strong>(Important: Use this command to properly stop the server.
