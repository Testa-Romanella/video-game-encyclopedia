{"id": 422499, "slug": "dk-bathtime", "name": "DK BathTime", "name_original": "DK BathTime", "description": "<p>DK Bathtime is a bathing simulator in which players must clean as much of DK as they possibly can. The more bubbles you scrub away, the more points you get. The scrub brush is controlled by a Wiimote attached to a real life brush peripheral. For the full experience, it is highly recommend that you play this game in a bathtub or a reasonable facsimile. This game was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto and the epiphany he had to create the original Donkey Kong game while taking a bath.</p>\n<p>DK Bathtime was designed and developed by John Bruneau, flan, and Karl Hohn with additional sound and testing by Toby Do. The intro music, \"A Day at the Beach\" was written by Josie Brechner and the game music was composed by Karl Hohn. We would also like to thank Stella Cannefax and of course Shigeru Miyamoto. This game was commissioned by the MAGFest Indie Videogame Showcase and was first exhibited at Super MAGFest 2020 as part of the Indie Arcade's Electro Concierge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you would like to contact us or just chat about the game we often hangout on the unofficial\u00a0fan discord.</p>\r\n\r\nBabycastles\r\n<p>DK Bathtime was made with an incredible amount of\u00a0support from Babycastles. Babycastles is a non-profit videogame art gallery and DIY space in New York.\u00a0If you love this game PLEASE DONATE! Thank you.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>Pair your Wiimote with your computer before you start the game. If it is connected, the game should detect it automatically. Waggle the controller to scrub, rotate the controller to change the angle. Use the D-pad to enter your initials on the high score page. High Scores are saved in a text file, the first time the game runs it might ask for write permissions.</p>\r\nLegal Disclaimer\r\n<p>This game is a joke.
