It's so messy that I can't really keep up with my schedule. it's a lesson To be honest, I feel really bad. Not quite as I think. I don't feel like releasing it to play at all. But this game made me know many things and try many things. The game may not have much. There might be some bugs. Player facilities may also not be available in some parts. because it was removed because of the problem on the last day that can not be fixed in time</p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to play can try. This is like an experimental game for me to learn unity[it's my first time coding and using unity]. I know that I really didn't plan well enough. Maybe It's really not perfect, cause I did it with the deadline time I had. In the next times, I will make better. Anyone who has played or looked at it and would like to give me advice, feel free plz teach me</p>\n<p>PS 0. The development of this game has been stopped.</p>\n<p>PS. 1. It saves according to the map, so you can press it out at any time.</p>\n<p>P.S. 2 If assuming the game has a bug that can't be played until the end, there may be more updates for this game. You can Dm me on twitter</p>\n<p>P.S. 3 I'm not good at programming But you can hire me as an artist XD</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:44:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a30/a30fae4195a10048ec19aa4f6bcc608f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greerenz"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
