It's now up to you to try and\u00a0\u00a0save them. All you gotta do is lower their infection level by\u00a0shooting them with your special healing gun.<br/></p>\n<p>Just remember, even though they're the friends you know and love, they are still zombies, so whatever you do, <strong>don't let them get you</strong>!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game controls are pretty simple. You use the <strong>Right/Left </strong>arrow keys to move, <strong>Up </strong>button to jump and <strong>Left Ctrl</strong> to shoot. That's it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game was made as part of \"My First Game Jam: Summer 2022\" . It was my first game jam so I decided to go solo and try to do everything on my own. I\u00a0 hope you enjoy what I made.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for visiting!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-15T10:29:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/706/706e29821c577135689db292f403bae6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["shuffle8"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
