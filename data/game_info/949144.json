They give you some coins back\u00a0\u00a0Idea\r\n<p>The game was created for the Jame Gam #26.\u00a0The given special object was \"Cards\" so I had the idea to program a card game, here the\u00a0given theme \"You are the monster\" was important. Instead of having a hero fight a monster as usual, I decided to reverse the roles. You fight with monsters against heroes. Since the whole thing had to be realised in only 5 days, I put less priority on animations than on a variety of features and design (animations will definitely come in the future). For the game engine I chose Unit because I had already done one or the other tutorial project in it before.</p>\r\nStats\r\nI spend around\u00a0<strong>45h</strong> on developing the game itself and also around\u00a0<strong>2h</strong> to make the game concept.\r\nCredits\r\nWithout the following users/sites/tools the project wouldn\u2018t be possible to finish in time:\r\n<ul><li>Pixabay - Used for the sound effects\u00a0&amp; music tracks\u00a0</li></ul>\n<ul><li>CafeDraw(Card Design), analogStudios_(Enemy &amp; Monster sprites)\u00a0on itch.io - For the\u00a0game assets</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Tiny Worlds\u00a0on Unity Assets Store - For the pixelart font</li></ul>\n<ul><li>ChatGPT \u00a0- For the help of making the base game concept &amp; helping with problems</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Midjourney - For the logo design</li></ul>\n<br/>\r\nAlso thanks to all beta testers from my discord community for helping me to find &amp; fix bugs, and all other people that contributed to the project(For playing and\u00a0sharing the game)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T14:27:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd8d0012197dac70dc4f30b4d3d0cf34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheDanniCraft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
