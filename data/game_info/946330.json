I just procedurally generated an additional \"data\" texture containing the map tiles information (water, grass, snow, etc..) and customized some of their rendering in the tunnel shader.<br/>- The trees are procedurally generated (poor solution from scratch but okay), not the leaves.<br/>- The owl spritesheets are generated with the help of StableDiffusion, then a\u00a0Flowframes run to create extra in-between frames.<br/>- The hedgehog is modeled by hand using\u00a03D signed distance fields.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Assets &amp; Credits</strong><br/>-\u00a0Engine:\u00a0https://ebitengine.org/<br/>- SFX<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Reset sound by legoluft<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0River ambient by ATTILA<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Wind ambient by Videvo<br/>- Images<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0- Leaf sprites by Kenney<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Ebitengine splash art<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0- Textures by @juliovii (license: CC-By)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0https://juliovii.itch.io/pspk01<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0https://juliovii.itch.io/stylizedpk02<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0https://juliovii.itch.io/stylizedpk01<br/>- \"Music\" of endgame =&gt; me lol (noticeable)</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks to Wraken, giab IRL friends, and @tinne (from ebitengine discord server)\u00a0for feedback during development<br/>Thank you Hajime Hoshi for developing and maintaining Ebitengine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T15:46:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbc/fbc6e9b00ef6f13fb355ddc223f2f0ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zyk0"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
