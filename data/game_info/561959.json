Due to the time limit, I have to make do with the default and hastily-made assets.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/></p>\n<p>WASD = Move</p>\n<p>Left-Click = Select a Circle. Selected Circle will have a white dot on top of them.</p>\n<p>Right-Click = Shoot a bomb from your selected circle.</p>\n<p>Q/E = Split selected Secondary-Color Circle horizontally or vertically, respectively.</p>\n<p>Control circles of different colors, and combine primary color circles together to make stronger secondary colors! While as a Secondary-Color circle, you have the combined\u00a0HP of your components\u00a0and instantly kill colors that match your component colors! If you attack a color that matches your own, you take normal damage. Otherwise, you deal half the damage! The same logic applies to your enemy Squares as well, so plan your attack accordingly! Hope you had fun!</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Tile assets and Programming - Robin Belo</p>\n<p>Sound Effects provided by MixKit.co (https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)</p>\n<p>Music generated by WolframTones (https://tones.wolfram.com/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99c/99cde76888f1bd5fd35485429e215e7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreenGuyGeno"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
