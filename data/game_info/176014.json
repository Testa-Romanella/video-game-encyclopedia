Scroll down for a link to play this game on Github.)</p><p>A game for the Super Love Jam based on this tumblr post. As someone who identifies on the asexuality spectrum it made me laugh to think of a game that defies the common meaning for the colloquialism \"thirsty\" and is literally about being thirsty and just trying to get a drink. I went into creating this game with these core ideas in mind:</p><ul><li>Make the game in Pico-8</li><li>Make the game quickly and iterate quickly to practice my fundamental Lua knowledge</li><li>Practice my sprite skills by mimicking very common symbols (emoji)</li><li>Have a \"complete\" (playable) game by the end of the weekend</li><li>Make a cute little music loop for the intro screen</li></ul><p> I think I succeeded in accomplishing these goals. Hope you enjoy playing my little game!</p>&lt;3", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc0/cc0c183f0cd1141e86c8e1ccd2fb1391.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jeffcampbell"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
