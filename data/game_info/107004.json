{"id": 107004, "slug": "death-race-itch", "name": "Death Race (itch)", "name_original": "Death Race (itch)", "description": "<p>One of the most controversial games of its time has been remade for PC!</p>\n<p>Death Race pits the player against evasive, running Gremlins. The object of the game is simple. Hit a Gremlin when they've ventured onto the road and you win a point. Crash into one of their tombstones you've created and you're stuck for a second unless you hit reverse and start back up!</p>\n<p>Each game causes its own maze of crosses that players must steer through. The more kills, the more crosses; the more crosses, the harder the steering becomes. As your skill increases it\u00a0becomes more difficult to maneuver\u00a0but the Gremlins also become constrained by the maze of crosses. Master switching into reverse and back to build up a high score.</p>\n<p>Features 1 and 2 player modes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controllers (Gamepads) and keyboard (WASD or Arrow keys) are supported.</p>\n<p>This is a fan implementation of the original cabinet arcade game made by Exidy in 1976, updated to play on today's computers. The original is now rare and with no emulation seemingly possible, this PC version has been released for anyone struggling to find it and get their Death Race fix.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This version attempts to keep close to the original, however there are small differences. The addition of menu screens help to\u00a0tastefully bring back some of the cabinet imagery. If you feel some important aspects in the gameplay\u00a0are missing, please, feel free to offer feedback.</p>\n<p>Background info on the original: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Race_(1976_video_game)</p>\n<p>Enjoy the Gremlin hunting.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3f/b3f11c2e25b0780104cf9fd29406d686.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fabien Brooke"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
