I\u00a0made \"Mirrors\" Halloween of 2017 and was recently reminded of it's existence and decided to upload it here, although\u00a0I still have a passion for game development and would love to further continue creating horror games, preferably better horror games, I am aware of how hard game development is and without the skills needed to make assets and environments by myself making good horror games is a challenge. I hope to upload more projects here in the future and maybe one day start a team to create even better ones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out \"Mirrors\"!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c3b48d143af055fc3cf700cf62e1f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BlueDart Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
