So we made a Top Down, Shoot-em-Up, and we added money acquiring, and upgrade progression as our own little twist on the retro arcade style.</p>\n<p>We've also decided to avoid telling anyone what the controls are, or how to play. If you can't figure it out, we made a pretty shitty arcade game. The game has no ending and is played purely for score, but it does run rather deep with more difficult enemies, and better cash rewards as you go on.</p>\n<p>We enjoyed the design behind this game so much, we're actually looking at developing the game further, with bosses, more trading posts, better upgrades, and more for the future.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Blake Blakeslee - Designer/\"Artist\"</p>\n<p>Stratton Whisler - Programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ff/8ff4c388ade53eb9932b6d834b156fd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kwanton"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
