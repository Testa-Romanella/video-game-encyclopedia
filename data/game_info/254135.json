Hard decisions have to be made...<br/></p>\n<p>To win the game, you have to fill your Blues Power Bar (Blue). To get Blues Power, you have to tap onto a note when it passes the white square in the center, so timing is important!</p>\n<p>The more you play, the more fans will gather up to listen to you. This will multiply your earned Blues Power. But making music is exhausting! Your Hunger Bar (red) is constantly drained, an empty Hunger Bar means that you loose the game.</p>\n<p>This means that you have to snack some fans from time to time to refill your Hunger Bar, tap onto some fans to gobble them up. But don\u2019t eat too many fans! With less fans you will earn less Blues Power, possibly making a level impossible to finish!</p>\n<p>[Currenty work in progress due to gitissues followed by Gamebreaking-Bugs, sorry folks...]</p>\n\n<p>Team: AspiringDragons</p>\n<p>Keywords used: Jahrmarkt(Graphics), Blues (Music), Dilemma(Mechanics)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6f/c6f2a712a3f30a1e0caeef3e1fd7eb4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Nomido"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
