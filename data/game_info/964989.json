When dice are your means of both moving and attacking, you better have a good set of them. Battle through procedurally generated dungeons where every move is important. Stop the monsters that are trying to slaughter your dice! </strong><h3>Turn based dungeon crawler</h3>The dice have been re-rolled; it is a new turn. Plan ahead and see what is optimal in the situation or play fast and hope for the best. Keep enemies at a safe distance or kill them off before they get to you. When the turn is over, it will be too late to run.<h3>Unique health system</h3><br/>There is no standard health bar in this game. When an enemy attacks, your dice take damage and break, in the order that you placed them. Make sure the most important dice breaks last, since there is little hope of victory if the enemy broke your ability to move.<h3>Three dungeon types with a total of 15 unique dice</h3>The game has only started when the first boss is beat. Reveal the new dungeons with a completely new set of dice and enemies, each dungeon promoting different playstyles. The enemies themselves are unique and have different movement and attacking patterns. By learning the abilities of enemies, you will be able to plan with precision.<br/><h3>Upgradable arsenal</h3>Throughout the levels you will not only find new dice to pick up, but there are also upgrades to be assigned. The upgrades are applied per dice, so better pick carefully. Upgrades expand on the dice\u2019s usability, sometimes even letting you play in a way that was not possible without the upgrade.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-18T03:48:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4b9bb6db2d78cdc9427ad5b522f2f49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NitramiuZ"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NitramiuZ"], "esrb_rating": null}
