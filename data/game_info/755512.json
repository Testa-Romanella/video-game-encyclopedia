Controls would be standard vim instead of arrows ( W,w,B,b,$,^).\u00a0 Other functionality in mind would be cut and paste characters  between different parts of the map\u00a0and\u00a0gather\u00a0characters\u00a0which\u00a0would\u00a0also\u00a0work\u00a0as ammunition. <br/></p><p>Available on GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/tonybjorkman/vim-metroidvania <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T07:17:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f30/f30f9aaa6fff0f6fe775fb8874de5e28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tonybjorkman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
