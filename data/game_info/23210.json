If you don\u2019t desire a challenge and want something more casual, please do not purchase this game. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Still here? Good. <br/><br/>In order to set expectations let me explain what's going to happen during your first 30 seconds playing Just Ski! <br/><br/>The game is going to open with a small skier stretching and crouching... stretching and crouching... This is the game trying to show you how the controls work. You will likely dismiss this and click the screen as the \"click to start\" text instructs.<br/><br/>The skier will instantly start accelerating to the right and you're going to start to panic ever so slightly because you\u2019re not really sure what to expect.<br/><br/>At full speed, your skier is going to approach and then launch off the first jump... You are going to flail the mouse around in a desperate attempt to gain control. You are going to fail and you are going smack the ground hard in epic fashion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At this point one of two things will happen:<br/><br/>1. You'll be intrigued by the utter lack of control you seemed to have over the skier and at the seemingly impossible task the game has thrown at you.<br/><br/>2. You will rage-quit in frustration and push for a refund.<br/><br/>As the developer I'm obviously hoping for scenario 1. Just Ski! really isn't as difficult as it will feel after that first failed jump.  It will certainly take some time to learn as it requires you to become proficient at an entirely new intrinsic skill, but once that is done I think you'll see the difficulty isn't quite what it once seemed.<br/><br/>The controls for Just Ski are simple to understand yet require real work to master because they are physics based.  Moving the mouse up and down simply controls whether the skier is stretching or crouching.  Just like in the real world, this determines how slow or fast the skier rotates while in the air. (Lookup conservation of angular momentum in any physics textbook.)<br/><br/>Once mastered, Just Ski will feel smooth and rewarding with just the right amount of challenge to keep things interesting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One last thing. Pay attention to the color of sky and the color of the sun. The color of the sky will change as you get further along the ski path and the color of the sun represents your best run.<br/><br/>-Have fun and thanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:46:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b55/b55c56985c93a244a2b4b9f938fe5109.jpeg", "website": "http://farseergames.com/justski", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 139, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS"], "developers": ["Farseer Games", "Jeff Weber"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Farseer Games", "Jeff Weber"], "esrb_rating": null}
