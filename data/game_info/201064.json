{"id": 201064, "slug": "box-invasion", "name": "Box Invasion", "name_original": "Box Invasion", "description": "<p>This game involves the clicking of boxes as they randomly appear on your screen. As u advance levels, the boxes will spawn faster and faster. And If u wait too long to destroy a box, the box will turn red, and then explodes if left alone, causing you to lose health. You'll restart the level from the beginning if you lose all of your health. In addition, you can also use the story button to buy in-game perks (still a work in progress though) to help you throughout your gaming.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1f/b1f203e033c9d7ce761570b871c31cb0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Beker"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
