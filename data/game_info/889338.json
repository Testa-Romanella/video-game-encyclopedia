The thing is, I'm not a native English speaker, and I have the tendency to reduce my ascent and to make sure I sound as natural as possible. In fact, my whole game development career is built on the sole purpose of learning English. I've learned Unity in English, coding in English(obviously), and writing game stories in English. So making sure that I sound as natural as possible is also one of the core goals of the whole thing.</p>\n<p>There for, I recorded the same lines over and over again, and when I still was not satisfied with the result, I took a lot the time editing the audio, making sure I cut out every single part that I did like.....(maybe I didn't, there are just way too many pronunciation mistakes there...) Plus I only had so little time to work on this, like a couple of hours a week.</p><p><strong>I think this is a good place to admit, the real reason behind all of these excuses is procrastination &gt;_&lt;</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Before I knew it, it's been 18 months...</p>\n<p>But, better late than never, isn't it?</p>\n<p>I know this is just a basic, simple tutorial, and it's nowhere nice perfect. but it means a lot to me, it's the first time I speak a new language to do something I like ( I make a game demo called \"Soul Delivery\" before, but I didn't use my voice in the process)</p>\n<p>So, I hope you would like to join me on the journey.</p>\n<p>Enjoy, and please let me know if you run into any problems in the tutorials, I'd like to help.</p>\n<p>Ryan</p>\n<p>2022.11</p>\n<p>You can get the tutorial in the link below<br/>(you can get all of the art assets of the game by pursuing the tutorial)</p>\n<p>https://www.udemy.com/course/project-little-adventurer-learn-to-create-a-3d-acti...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T17:54:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4a/a4ae9b43575754d9f6e1a55e0eac2e36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 212, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SingleMindedRyan"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
