Your only way to fulfill your order is manipulating the nuclear reactor near the entrance. Unfortunately there are several security measures applied. You will have to find a way to disable them in advance.</p>\n<p>Of course the human people left some guardian robots in and near the habitat so you job won't be easy. Unluckily your mind is stuck in a loop, so that even if they destory your bio-hybrid body, your memories will always be transferred back into a new Des-Tro-Bot and you will have to continue your mission. There is no way out <em>(except a Rage-Quit)</em>.</p>\n<p>You should try not to die too often as dieing will give the guardian bots a chance to repair some of the damage you made.</p><p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p><ul><li><strong>WASD / Left Stick\u00a0-&gt; Movement</strong></li><li><strong>F/E (Controller: A) -&gt; Interact</strong> (Destroying things is done by holding F/E)</li><li><strong>Escape (Controller: Menu) -&gt; Give up (hold) / Close Dialog</strong></li></ul><p><em>Hint: If you want to destroy a switchboard, hold Interact while standing near it.</em></p><p>This game has been created within less than 72 hours\u00a0during Ludum Dare Jam 47 from scratch.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22c5c20e4cc4b2b9dc3a439911b93947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Firesplash"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
