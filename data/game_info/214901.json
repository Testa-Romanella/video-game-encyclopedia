(Tested with XBox360 for Windows) The keyboard control scheme is really inconvenient, but usable.<br/></p>\n<p>Aliens kidnapped you during the night. You wake up in an alien spaceship, on a wheelchair, with only your trusted Bazookas and Machine Guns with you. What can you do?</p>\n<p>You're unable to move, but your two big weapons might just push you in the right direction...<br/><br/></p>\n<p>PS: I really struggled with time,, there is no menu, and as soon as you die, the game closes. Hope this won't fully ruin the experience.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Controller:</p>\n<p>Left stick - rotate left weapon</p>\n<p>LB - switch left weapon</p>\n<p>LT - fire left weapon</p>\n<p>Right stick - rotate right weapon</p>\n<p>RB - switch right weapon</p>\n<p>RT - fire right weapon</p>\n\n<p>Keyboad:</p>\n<p>wasd - rotate left weapon</p>\n<p>q/e - switch left weapon</p>\n<p>left alt/x - fire left weapon</p>\n<p>ijkl - rotate right weapon</p>\n<p>u/o - switch right weapon</p>\n<p>right alt/, [comma] - fire right weapon</p>\n\n<p>SOURCES:</p>\n<p>Theme: https://opengameart.org/content/high-tech-lab</p>\n<p>Sounds: from\u00a0 https://opengameart.org/content/4-projectile-launches and https://opengameart.org/content/chaingun-pistol-rifle-shotgun-shots</p>\n<p>Sprites: https://opengameart.org/content/ufo-enemy-game-character https://opengameart.org/content/bazooka https://opengameart.org/content/ak-47-icon<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d37/d37bbd1081ecb33712cf9a24ee1837c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LolliDepp"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
