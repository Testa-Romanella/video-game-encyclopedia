We were given the theme, 'Horror', and asked to create a small self contained level. I decided to create a maze in which the player must collect 8 purple flames in order to complete the level. The magic meter serves as not only the players ammo, but also their health, if the meter runs out the game is over. The meter will drain gradually over time, but if the player defeats an enemy or collects one of the 8 purple flames, their magic meter will re-fill.</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement, LEFT MOUSE BUTTON - Fire.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T04:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f71/f71a5db9ab558dd08535d8e3f4f0177b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GCRagnarok"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
