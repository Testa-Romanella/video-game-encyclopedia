Be <strong>careful</strong>, many \"<em>triangle</em>\" wants <strong>to kill you</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Your only weapon is your <strong>hand</strong>: you can <strong>throw them to teleporte</strong> <strong>all over the place!</strong></p>\n<p><em>But, wait, how can i defeat ennemis with just a teleportation? I can't fight them? </em>No, you can't.</p>\n<p>However, you can use the <strong>AIKIDO </strong>to <strong>defeat </strong>your opposant.<strong> Backfire the ennemis attacks, to crash them, and win points doing combos.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Are you ready? Good Luck, and don't forget, <strong>AIKIDO </strong>is the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>------------</p>\n<p><strong>GAME DESIGN:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Our contraints is to make a<strong> fun prototype</strong> with <strong>primary geometrics shapes\u00a0</strong>with<strong> SHIVA\u00a0ENGINE.</strong></p>\n<p>Our design begin with find a experience: \"<strong>AIKIDO</strong>\", or in other words,<strong>\u00a0backfire the ennemis attacks.</strong></p>\n<p>Main competences is <strong>reflex </strong>and <strong>anticipation</strong>.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>We want to <strong>challenge </strong>players in there <strong>reflex</strong> and <strong>anticipation </strong><strong>skill</strong>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0During this project, we learned the <strong>Rationnal Game Design</strong>, and try to use it on our game. By <strong>rationalising</strong> our first prototype, we find our \"<strong>game heart</strong>\": <strong>To dodge.\u00a0</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This method was very benefit because it help us to <strong>find </strong>the \"fun\" of our game, and <strong>ajust</strong> our design.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a03C are very important for us</strong>, we past long time to find a good <strong>speed</strong>, a good <strong>fluidity </strong>in the jump, at every level of design.\u00a0As the player have just on action, it need to be very <strong>pleasant</strong>, and<strong> easy to handle.\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The player can move<strong> only\u00a0horizontaly,</strong> but the ennemis can go<strong> in every direction</strong> (XY axis):\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0At this moment, we had a build concept, we knew the heart or our game and good 3C. We continue <strong>designing ennemis</strong>:</p>\n<p>The <strong>timing </strong>of ennemis spawn<strong> is a key</strong> to the <strong>rythm of the game</strong>. It need to be the <strong>metronome of the intensity</strong> of the current phase. So, if we do a curve with the time of apparition of every ennemis, and the current time, we have to find somethings like a \"<strong>flow curve</strong>\":\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Actually in our prototype, the player move only horizontaly, and ennemis can move in all direction in XY axis. We add a new mecanics: <strong>jump case</strong>. If a ennemis crash on this case, <strong>the player jump.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>At this moment, the player <strong>can take the bonus</strong> in the air, and make <strong>lot of point.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>BUT, <strong>he his close</strong> to the <strong>ennemis spawn</strong> too,\u00a0It's a<strong> risk and reward</strong> moment: </p>\n\n<p><em>red = ennemis spawn\u00a0 &amp;\u00a0green = point</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0One of the\u00a0contraint was \"<strong>use simple geometrical forms</strong>\". Our volontee was to make a character design who explain the function of it: \"<strong>Form Follow Function\"</strong>. In this way we do the design of the characters: <strong>Triangle </strong>for this sharp angle is the bad guy, the <strong>square </strong>the good, and the <strong>circle </strong>the bonus.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>POST MORTEM:</strong></p>\n<p>- The <strong>rythm </strong>of the game need <strong>more iteration</strong>, it became<strong> very intensive to fast</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Camera of 3C doesn't work. It <strong>need camera move</strong> when the\u00a0player move, dodge, jump, take point, etc.</p>\n<p>- <strong>The player haven't any reward when he do a good move</strong>, or take lot of point, or have a big combo. <strong>That is a mistake</strong> in the kind of game, it should motive the player, and be emotionaly pleasing.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Music don't grow up</strong>. He should have\u00a0to start slowly, and be <strong>as intensitive than the ennemis waves.</strong></p>\n<p>- Tuto understand by half of player.</p>\n<p>- Jump can be to be more develop, it's a rich mecanics<strong> underuse</strong></p>\n<p><strong>------------</strong></p><p>Worker: <strong>2 students,\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Technologies: <strong>Shiva </strong>-&gt; Lua and XML, <strong>Phaser</strong> -&gt; JS</p>\n<p>Production time: <strong>2 weeks,</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a\u00a0<strong>student project</strong>\u00a0for the ETPA Game Design School.<br/></p>\n<p>By Draina:\u00a0Here\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Angelo:\u00a0Here\u00a0 \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-18T06:34:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a05/a0526aa494414d489ddeb02502e71282.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["angelo_pinho"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
