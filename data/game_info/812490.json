I\u00a0created this game by following the\u00a0\"Unreal 5.0 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games\". The course covered a lot of ground with C++ programming, I\u00a0found it quite difficult at parts but glad I\u00a0could finish it, and I\u00a0am now more confident in using Blueprints and C++ together.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite features was adding a health bar and a post process effect when the health gets below 1/3rd. I\u00a0also utilised the new Unreal Meta Sounds plugin, this allowed me to modulate the pitch of the engine sound I\u00a0used so that it goes higher in pitch when the tank is accelerating, and back down when not moving.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-04T11:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1bb959f9b94589a33931801ac39064c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OddPhishGames"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
