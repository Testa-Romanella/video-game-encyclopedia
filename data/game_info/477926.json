Unlike being able to control time\u00a0this makes its user take into account their surroundings before using the abilities they have at their disposal for fear of attracting the Guardians of Time which will consume some of the users time should they catch them.</p><p>Your goal as the player is to turn on the switches in the room in their given order in order to progress through the Trials.
