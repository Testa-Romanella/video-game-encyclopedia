Aquillanto is like a classic 8-bit or 16-bit platform game... on steroids... and in HD! Inspired by my love of the Amiga500 days. I really hope you enjoy it.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:52:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/377/37789a38d5cc20bf70be8a76f18cd420.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aquillanto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
