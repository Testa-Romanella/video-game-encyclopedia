Witness the success and tragedy\u00a0of your humans and aliens alike\u00a0as you help them survive the cold harsh environment of outer space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The game is modelled around feeding the story generation that goes on in the\u00a0</strong><strong>players mind,\u00a0</strong>that lead to players sharing great storytelling through games like The Sims, Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld.\u00a0The game features a Narrator, who chooses which events to send at your station to keep the gameplay and storytelling alive.</p>\n<p><strong>The crew are autonomous.\u00a0</strong>They will carry out tasks and fulfill their needs as they see fit.\u00a0\u00a0You decide which orders to issue, but some may choose to work against you, or prioritize their own goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Each crew member will have a unique mix of\u00a0traits, beliefs and attributes,</strong>\u00a0that shape both their\u00a0work life and how their relationships with other crew members\u00a0will develop.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>You can be a benevolent AI, or an authoritarian.</strong>\u00a0Satisfying the needs of your crew is not a must,\u00a0you will be able to keep them suppressed through fear of their machine overlord. Enjoy the volatile control tyranny brings you and your robot army, or give up your\u00a0freedoms in return for a happy crew.</p>\n<p><strong>Alien life is unique, and pose\u00a0different\u00a0challenges.</strong> Aliens will have different personalities and attributes than humans, which can be as useful as they can be dangerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Injuries reside on different body parts, which affect relationships and their work life.</strong> Limbs and organs will be replaceable\u00a0by plant-grown or robotic limbs, and alien bodies have unique strengths and vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Factions and individuals can have their own goals and motivations.</strong> Through relationships, departments may clash, and individuals\u00a0are incentivized to carry out autonomous goals, even if they can be detrimental to public safety.</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Narrator</li><li>Crew with needs and mental breakdowns</li><li>Construction</li><li>Mining<br/>\n</li><li>Food chain from the garden\u00a0to the kitchen</li><li>One generic enemy<br/>\n</li><li>Medical system</li><li>And several more partially implemented ones</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Station Overseer is a mix of sci-fi and retro styles.</strong> Despite the high-tech energy weaponry, the machinery is old, and the detective still seems to live in the 50's. This style is inspired by Space Station 13, with the immense variety and clash of cultures it brings.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The game contains bugs and\u00a0is missing essential features.</strong> The aim of this release is to show the potential, fully knowing it is very rough and not yet\u00a0a fully enjoyable game, that is why...</p>\n<p><strong>The game in its earliest stages is provided for free.</strong>\u00a0I don't think the game deserves to be a paid product before it's genuinely fun to play.\u00a0Money won't be a hindrance for several years while I am a student, and it's not needed for development. With that being said,\u00a0the game will get a price tag later in the alpha.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay tuned</strong> for dev logs that will show the progress, and <strong>share your thoughts</strong>. Feedback and bug reports are always appreciated.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T09:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/daeda10cb6ee64a69cb8e94ffe8fee36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["V1king", "SpaceMaster47"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
