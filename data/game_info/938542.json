The being has no memory of their former life, but the areas they must explore offer hints as to who they once were. So far we\u2019ve implemented a menu screen and a first level. The first level doesn\u2019t come with explicit instructions but is meant to fill the role of a tutorial. Future levels will be more challenging.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>This game uses simple directional controls. You can choose between W, A, S, and D, or the arrow keys. The up key is jump, the down key is crouch, and the left and right keys are to move left and right, or if crouched, to crouch-walk in the corresponding direction. To enter a door, walk in front of it and press the up key. There is also a pouncing mechanic; press the up key and a direction at the same time to pounce in that direction at full horizontal speed.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T11:19:54", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nutch4719"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
