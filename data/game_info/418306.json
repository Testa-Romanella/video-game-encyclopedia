I got good performance by calculating all the flocks in one script, but nevertheless, if you plan to use tens of thousands of birds, this will certainly affect the performance decrease.<br/><br/>Animation of birds, fish and butterflies implemented using shaders. The asset includes two shaders, one for birds and butterflies, the second for fish.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Control:<br/>Mouse - rotation of the camera.<br/>Mouse wheel - zoom in and out.<br/>Left mouse button - slow motion.<br/>W - camera to the top.<br/>S - camera to the bottom.<br/>T - one screenshot.<br/>Y - auto repeat screenshot.<br/>U - +1 second (auto repeat screenshot).<br/>J - -1 second (auto repeat screenshot).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/115502791aefe73890ac6ddf5629bf86.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["#NVJOB Nicholas Veselov"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
