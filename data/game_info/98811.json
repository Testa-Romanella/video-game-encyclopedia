The Empire has spread it's reign around the globe. Why now though? After all these centuries of peace, why would the Empire want to eradicate the magi from existence? Is it truly out of fear for the powers that magi can posses, or is it something far more sinister...?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>GAMEPLAY:</strong></p>\n<p>Eternal Twilight is an old-school styled fantasy RPG with a Turn-Based battle system. I have made much use of the plethora of amazing scripts that Yanfly has created for the MV system to bring a battle system that is familiar, yet original in its own right. I am a firm believer of quality over quantity when it comes to designing a battle system and the types of skills a player has at their disposal. The battle system in Eternal Twilight features the following:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Unique weapon/armor system, where enemy drops will \"randomly select\" a rarity for the item dropped, granting bonus stats to that item! Legendary Bronze Sword anyone? YES PLEASE!</li><li>Intelligent enemy AI that will keep the player on their toes. The AI will respond according to the player's actions to make sure \"LOL-SPAM ATTACK\" will lead to the players demise.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Five unique character classes, each with a vastly different play style than the last!\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Skills come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from Instant cast spells that don't consume the character's turns, to very powerful attacks, buffs, and heals that have cooldowns, making sure the player strategically chooses when to use certain abilities.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>This and much more!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae3/ae33a87b9c640c98faa692e5d783dafa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 384, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fernyfer775"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
