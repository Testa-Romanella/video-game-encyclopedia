No reloading, no drama, no other modern trends. Just you, your gun, and your enemies. A lot of them. <br/>The game is implemented in the rogue-like mechanics, the levels and weapons are generated on the fly. Your task is to move forward, through the foes, deeper and deeper into the underworld. If you die, you just start all over again. <br/>Oh, yes. Forgot about the story. This stuff is based on the Nordic folklore. You find yourself at the top level of Niflheim, and desperately want to talk to Hel. This is all you need to know about it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The game in development, so it lacks of content and possibly have some stability issues. Updates will be available on this page. When getting a message about an update being available, simply re-download the game from this page.</p>\n<p>At the moment only first chapter available - 2 levels and chapter boss.
