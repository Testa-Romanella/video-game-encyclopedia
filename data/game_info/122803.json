I really appreciate your patronage.</p><p>Bound is a 2.5d exploration platformer that was created as a student project over 16 weeks by a lone developer (that would be me) and is in fact my first game.</p><p>You play as Joot Lightray, a down on his luck space explorer who crash lands on a strange alien planet. In order to find rescue he must collect various gravity themed power ups to allow access to new areas of the game world.</p><p>Although a demo/prototype student project, the game does tell a complete story and contain all features. The game world is still quite small so it'll probably take less than an hour to complete. There are still a few kinks in there - some animations glitch etc, however it shouldn't give any major trouble and is still highly playable! </p><p>Give it a shot and let me know what you think- drop me a comment on twitter at @michaelarby. This was my first game and was basically my intro to the Unity engine. However, if feedback is positive I'll consider developing it further into a full game.</p><p>Thanks guys!</p><p>Michael</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eae/eae354eb604411fb5cd513bfa53f23c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["michaelarby"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
