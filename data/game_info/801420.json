All Rights Belong to Capcom.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Please Support the Official Breath of Fire Releases.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Like  many of you, I grew up playing the Breath of Fire franchise, and like  you I've been waiting for another official BOF release. It has always  been my dream to create a Breath of Fire Game. This project is both one  of obsession and passion that I have devoted 2 years of my life crafting  in between working and school. While I long to follow my dream to make  video games for a living, I must work to support my family. So, I'm  hoping to transition into making indie games full-time soon, but before I  fully committed I wanted to create this game that I've dreamt of.  I  apologize this game is still a bit buggy, but it is my hope that you  will enjoy it for what it is.\r\n</p>\n<p>I  have a strong desire to keep adding content to this game; however, it is  at a point that I feel it is ready for an initial release so I can  focus on other projects. I know there are bugs that I missed, but I hope  you can forgive for them, and I hope you have an enjoyable time playing  the game. Let Capcom know BOF is not a dead series, and we long for an  official release!\r\n</p>\n<p>I must apologize  for not asking for express permission for many of the resources I\u2019ve  used because the secrecy of this fan project was essential. I have  listed all credit for any non-BOF resources that I\u2019ve used below. My  initial intent was to use only BOF 1-6 resources, but there were many  gaps that needed filled or updated.\r\n</p>\n<p>Please thank and support the individuals listed in the credits.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS For Non-Capcom Assets</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/5i7hir8g68qzdp5/Credits.docx?dl=0<br/></p><p><strong>My Creative Process If Interested</strong><br/></p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/lmb2hvzu1fg0n9e/Process.pdf?dl=0\r\n</p>\n<p>Once again thank you taking the time to read the post; I hope you enjoy the game,\r\n</p>\n<p><em>Knightmarish Games</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-13T07:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/168/168335a9ea3b075ff57c302d2ab6fa8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Agoraphobic"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
