They've been sent to the planet <strong>OS9</strong> to study a rare crystal, however they were given no warning there would be hostile life present. Without the means to defend themselves, a damaged ship, and limited comm capabilities who are they going to turn to...?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enter the Space Bum.</strong></p>\n<p>You are the space-venturing, quiet-spoken\u00a0soldier of fortune known throughout the universe\u00a0as:\u00a0<strong>Space Bum</strong>. Equipped with his trusty sidearms and personal teleportation device, the <strong>Space Bum</strong> is down for any mission just as long as payment is received for services rendered.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay for his time, and you'll be just fine.</strong></p>\n<p>It is said that a patron once hired the Space Bum to clean out his Spaceship Timeshare having been overrun by space pirates due to a long vacancy. Of course, the Space Bum completed the job in a timely manner; however the client had disappeared afterwards. The Space Bum spent a full year tracking down the client to complete the transaction (in a manner of speaking...).</p>\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p><strong>Space Bum For Hire</strong> plays as a platformer, built on the\u00a0Love2D game framework using the physic module. So yes, it is\u00a0a platformer running on Box2D (be sure to visit the parkour course on the Spaceship).</p>\n<p>The Space Bum comes equipped with\u00a0two weapons:</p>\n<br/><strong>Name</strong><strong>Qualities</strong>PistolLonger Range. More ammo available.ShotgunPowerful blast. More effective up close.\r\n<p>Also, The Space Bum carries a <strong>PET</strong> (Personal Electronic\u00a0Transporter).\u00a0 To use hit <strong>[TAB] </strong>to teleport to and from the Spaceship and <strong>OS9</strong>.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n<strong>[ W, S, A, D ]</strong>Move/Aim<strong>[ S ]</strong>Crouch<strong>[ SPACE ]</strong>Jump / (Skip Cutscene)<strong>[ K ]</strong>Shoot Weapon<strong>[ L ]</strong>Hold for Lock<strong>[ TAB ]</strong>Teleport to and from Spaceship[ P ]Pause/Unpause\r\nGamepad\r\n<strong>[ D-Pad ]</strong>Move/Aim<strong>[ Down ]</strong>Crouch<strong>[ B ]</strong>Jump<strong>[ A ]</strong>Shoot Weapon<strong>[ L-Trigger ]</strong>Hold for Lock<strong>[ R-Trigger ]</strong>Swap Weapons<strong>[ Select ]</strong>Teleport to and from Spaceship<strong>[ Start ]</strong>Pause/Unpause\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Holy smokes!

With about 6 cutscenes, it's not a long game. I wanted to add some reason to progress rather than just run-n-gun, even though the gameplay presents a pleasant\u00a0challenge sometimes. Some secrets lie within the levels...</p>\n<p>I really had fun working with the NPCs, bending them to my will by creating a bunch of behaviors, swapping them out in sequence to create the cutscenes\u00a0(lotta thanks to H.U.M.P. Timer).</p>\n<p>During any point in the game (except for cutscenes) you can press [TAB] to be teleported to and from the Spaceship.\u00a0The Spaceship acts as a safe-zone/menu, albeit there isn't really any menus in the game. It was more of an experiment, or possibly consideration for the future for including: RPG elements and you could manage your inventory, maintain stats, or purchase gear. Due to the limited time spent on the game (not-moe-jam-9) I didn't have time to... finish the thought,\u00a0so it became a place to chill and test your parkour skills. Consider it an \"interactive pause screen\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd6/cd6d0c674aaea7d57f4201f9d4f3f8d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 216, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["skrolikowski"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
