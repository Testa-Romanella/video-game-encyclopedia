{"id": 812019, "slug": "treasure-crater", "name": "Treasure Crater", "name_original": "Treasure Crater", "description": "<p>In the middle of a remote forest is a crater from a large meteor. The crater is said to contain many treasures in its walls, but also a mysterious force that saps a person's health away. While this can be combatted with health herbs, they could still be permanently depleted if their health gets too low.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How low will you dare to go?</p>\n<p>This game was made for Mini Jam 109: Theme depth, limitation health.</p><p>Update - stakes have increased! I wanted to make it so that if your health went below a certain level, you could not restore it (when your health value turns red), but a variable error was not allowing that ending to trigger. Fortunately I resolved the issue so whether or not you consume herbs can actually effect your ending now.\u00a0</p><p>I also fixed an error where consuming an herb above 45 health was automatically setting your health to 50, the original max health I used. Hope you enjoy the improved experience :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T15:27:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/906/9066fbf8044606c30b4ce2dd95785888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kobato Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
