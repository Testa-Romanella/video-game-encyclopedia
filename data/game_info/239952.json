It is a very large planet, full of contrasts and dangerous monsters, but M\u00fbn is a brave explorer with great survival skills and faces the adventure without any fear.<br/><br/>The only way to ask for redemption is to bring together the transmitter parts lost from spaceship during landing, which are scattered around various remote locations on the planet. With all the pieces, she will be able to build the antenna and send the distress signal.<br/><br/>Life on planet Ankora is not easy, to survive M\u00fbn must overcome hunger and thirst, looking for food and water, cooking her own provisions and struggling against the elements: rain, north freezing cold and hot summers in the desert, long nights full of dangers ...<br/><br/>But soon she will have unexpected help: the ANKs. The ANKs are a primitive race living in harmony in Ankora since ancient times. They are kind-hearted and are divided into tribes engaged in different occupations: farmers, fishermen, merchants, craftsmen, hunters and wisemen.<br/><br/>M\u00fbn has a lot to learn from the ANKs, who will willingly help her sharing their culture: teaching her to make tools, buildings and structures, objects of jewelry, all kinds of meals, recipes and even magic potions. In return, M\u00fbn will also provide her assistance through countless missions, specializing in each job and becoming a genuine ANK-hearted.<br/><br/>PLANET ANKORA<br/>Ankora has large dimensions, it is divided into 144 quadrants, M\u00fbn has great exploration work in this wild world, where nature has grown at will.

But nature will also provide the materials she needs to move forward and survive: wood, stone, metal and wild plants. Soon she learns to open her own ways, because Ankora is a changing and unique planet.<br/><br/>THE TOOLS<br/>Although M\u00fbn will begin the adventure with empty hands, the ANK tribe will accompany her sharing their secrets and showing her to make useful tools. The hammer to build structures, the shovel to dig or raise the terrain, the saw and the pickaxe to collect wood and stone, the hoe to cultivate and harvest ... and the spear and the hunting bow to defend herself.<br/><br/>OBJECT CRAFT<br/>A key task to survive will be to make her own objects and manage the resources she finds on her adventure.
