You can do tricks, play the ball back and forth over the net with Blobby or outplay him to score points. Because beach sand isn't very bouncy this is obviously no real tennis, but open ended play with a ball without fixed rules or goals.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb9/cb9daef3a901921ea5a7babe499ee44e.jpg", "website": "http://slindev.com/anchor/projects/blobby-tennis", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 117}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SlinDev"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SlinDev"], "esrb_rating": null}
