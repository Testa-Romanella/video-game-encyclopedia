I mainly develop in Java and picked up GML as a first language to start the learning process. I ever only released one other game though, an arcade game called Asteroid Avoid for android devices (It should still be up if you want to check it out). I really love experimenting with different game ideas and appreciate any feedback for this game!</p>\r\nI hope you enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3f/c3f2c3914a32b4cdb55198c9119ad0e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mpolder"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
