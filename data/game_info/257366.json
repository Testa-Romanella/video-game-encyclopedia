{"id": 257366, "slug": "russian-roulette", "name": "Russian roulette", "name_original": "Russian roulette", "description": "Russian Roulette is an experimental, free to play, persistent-world game with perma-permadeath. You only have only one life to play this game. You can choose to either play with a blank round or a real bullet. You can practice with blank rounds as many times as you want. Your wins and losses with a blank round won\u2019t count though. The only kills that count are the ones you make when you play with a real bullet. If you play with a real bullet and you die, you cannot play the game again.<br/>The location of the bullet is either deterministic or random. If the selector comes to rest in the green zone, you can exactly tell where the bullet will end up based on what chamber it was entered in. If the selector comes to rest in the red zone, the force is random and you won't be able to tell where the bullet is.<br/><br/><br/>You find yourself in a dark forest. Around you, there are hundreds of graves. You don\u2019t know how you ended up here. You can only see a shack in the middle of the woods. You walk towards it and inside you find a man who offers you a game that you cannot refuse to play...<br/><br/><br/>The game has a leaderboard in the form of a graveyard. Every time a player dies playing this game, a gravestone is added. The players who have a higher number of kills have their gravestones closer to the shack. You can add a message to the gravestone when you die. (The messages will be put through a profanity and spam filter)<br/><br/><br/>You can buy DLC to play the game after you die as a ghost.<br/><br/><br/>Russian Roulette is the prologue for a series of experimental games that I plan to make. The series is named The Divine Tragedy. This series is inspired by Dante Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy.  <br/>The mechanics in this prologue aim to convey the finality of death. It is not a choice. It is an inescapable truth. <br/>The only thing you can do is try your best to leave a mark on this world before you go.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a2/7a2892359dd1eefbc859c19aaa4643f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LAS Team", "Omey Salvi"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Sports", "Indie"], "publishers": ["LAS Team", "Omey Salvi"], "esrb_rating": null}
