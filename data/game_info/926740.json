Our cat has special features, he is a fluffy plump cat, his movement speed is reduced, cats are in no hurry! The bazooka is bulky, but it's his favorite weapon. The bazooka is controlled classically, shot straight and at an angle of 45-50 degrees. In the final boss battles, it is not the speed of the character that matters, not the speed of pressing buttons, not the flexibility of weapon control, and even your habit of passing action platformers will not help you! You will definitely need to develop tactics for passing each boss, where you will have to take into account all the properties of your character, environment and terrain.<h3>Who is our hero?</h3><br/>Our hero's name is Lucky and he's a cat. He lives in the far, far future. In our version of the future, cats have developed their civilization, conquered space and are at the stage of forming a Great Intergalactic Cat Empire. Lucky is a veteran and a special purpose cat who performs especially important assignments in different parts of the universe.<h3>Where did Lucky fly to?</h3>Returning from his last important assignment, our Lucky is already at home in his thoughts, but falls into a meteor shower and crashes on an unknown planet. Cut off from the means of communication and the opportunity to return home, Lucky needs to survive in an alien world for him, find a way to repair his ship and get out of an unknown planet.<h3>The planet is inhabited by various amorphous and robotic creatures:</h3><br/>- Amorphs are a new evolving technogenic-biological species on this planet, which arose as a result of a man-made catastrophe. Amorphs are not aggressive, but it is better not to touch unknown life forms.<br/><br/>- Robotic creatures and bosses are the remnants of an old man-made civilization that has been developing for many thousands of years, but is currently declining due to a large man-made disaster.<br/><br/>For hundreds of years there has been a confrontation between the Bosses of the old civilization and the Amorphous. Lucky becomes a casual witness to this confrontation, but most likely the Bosses of the old civilization have the very necessary spare parts for his box.<br/><br/>On the way, he is accompanied by his personal artificial intelligence M.U.R. Analyzing incoming information and helping to deal with a lot of tasks, M.U.R is Lucky's faithful comrade.<h3>What is special about our game?</h3><br/><ul><li>Unique fantastic setting<br/></li><li>Different tactics of boss fights<br/></li><li>Various forms of life<br/></li><li>Interact with the environment to solve puzzles<br/></li><li>Unique atmosphere of an alien planet with its secrets<br/></li><li>A unique history of an unknown civilization</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T05:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e7/4e7b449ac3cbb1cefd61a601a8c77e1e.jpg", "website": "https://victorycraft.studio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 285, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["VictoryCraftStudio"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["VictoryCraftStudio"], "esrb_rating": null}
