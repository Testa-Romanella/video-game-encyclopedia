Do you leave, making your playthrough not-so-inevitable,\u00a0or do you try to play a game that half-heartedly doesn't want to be played? There is only minor lack of risk to your life if you choose the latter.</p>\n<p>The voice of the other half of your brain was amazingly-done by a friend (here's\u00a0their youtube. I forgot to ask them for an official link) who didn't have the time to make their own game, but was able to record a\u00a0voiceover that\u00a0I could\u00a0assemble and use for the 'tutorial' screen. All speech mistakes had a perfect alternative, I just didn't double-check my audio cutting, and ran out of time.</p>\n<p>All other voices where my own. I apologize for the bad mic quality mixed with effects that try to mask it, this was a first :P<br/></p>\n<p>Take note when rating:</p>\n<ul><li>The tutorial screen voiceover\u00a0is allowed by Compo rules, but I'm going to apply my personal rule and say not to include it in ratings as it was sent over the internet.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The keybind framework\u00a0was part of my base code and allow me to more easily support different keyboard layouts. I have a feeling a lot of people will like it, but you probably shouldn't take it into your ratings</li><li>You can find my base code here, it includes a few small-but-tedious-to-make things like a pause,\u00a0sound effect, and settings framework</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:24:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/151/15148ac4f5660092b066b220895a19c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LandarVargan"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
