At the start of each race, the ball will be easy enough to get through, but they will become progressively more and more difficult, and some of them will even require you to pass the ball through a moving ball. You will also need to avoid shrinking too low, or grow too high, like hitting the ball of enemies on your screen the game is over.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a challenge, Flappy Crazy Basketball is your best option.
