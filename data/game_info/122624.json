Resources can be found all over the map to help with these conversations. This game can be downloaded for free, but 100% of any donations will go toward Camp Aranu'tiq.</p><p>Use WASD or arrow keys to move around the map and interact with objects. The four other characters are represented by clusters of lights, similar to the player character, and players must talk with each of them to remove the barriers blocking the exit and complete the game. Use \u2193 to speak to each character. Once each conversation is complete, a brightly colored line to the exit will appear; when all four lines are visible, the exit will open.<br/></p><p>Trigger warnings: brief discussion of surgery; some transphobic dialogue<br/></p><p>The music used in this game is \"Ambient Loop 3\" by Essa.
