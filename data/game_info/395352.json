Really :)</em></p>\n<p>Turn on your favourite music and dive into Bordered. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: bounce off the walls, dodge red balls and collect energy pieces to be able to jump. However, it becomes really challenging once you get the idea. Have a nice journey!</p>\n<p>I was dreaming to make a simple yet beautiful and interesting game and Bordered is the game I'm quite proud of. It's not perfect. There is always a room for improvement, yeah :) But it is the game I like playing and I hope you will, too! I will be glad to have any feedback from you.</p>\n<p>Thank Scott Buckley for the awesome music, released under Creative Commons.</p>\n<p><em>For Linux users: you can launch Bordered.love file by using the love2d package.
