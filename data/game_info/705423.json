Use your trusty speed boost power-up when it's ready to blast your way through the enemies to rack up your score.</p>\n<p>To move, use WASD or the arrow keys. Press SPACE to speed up when the cooldown is at zero.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>ENDURANCE is a remake of a game I created in Pygame of the same name. It was a simple project I\u00a0worked on during school, but I wanted to expand on it a little and remake it in an actual game engine. So, here we are.
