I'm just solving some bugs and adding some graphical effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Ninja peas is a game where you have a pea that moves around the board and interacts with its environment allowing him to score points. This pea thinks he is a ninja, and loves to jump and climb blocks.</p>\n<p>The pea climbs up and jumps off towers, down ramps, bounces on springs and moves slowly over gel blocks.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to collect the maximum number of flags you can before the timeout.</p>\n<p>Take care of your pea! if he fall more than 2 blocks, he will die!</p>\n<p><strong>Score rules:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>To score more than 1 point for each flag, see the following instructions:</p>\n<ul><li>You will receive 10 points if you catch a flag while falling from an edge of a block.</li><li>You will receive 5 points if you catch a flag while jumping between blocks.</li><li>In other cases, you will receive only 1 point for each flag</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Block types</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Standard Blocks</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Climbing:</strong>\u00a0Peas can climb the sides of the block.\r\n</li><li><strong>Walking:</strong>\u00a0Peas move across the surface of the block at full speed.\r\n</li><li><strong>Collision with top:</strong>\u00a0Falling peas stop when they land on the top of the block. If the fall is greater than 2 blocks in height, the pea dies.\r\n</li><li><strong>Collision with side:</strong>\u00a0Falling peas bounce off the side\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Spring Blocks</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Climbing:</strong>\u00a0Peas can\u2019t climb the sides of the block.\r\n</li><li><strong>Walking:</strong>\u00a0Peas move across the surface of the block at full speed.\r\n</li><li><strong>Collision with top:</strong>\u00a0Falling peas are launched upward with greater velocity if they fall on the top of the block.
