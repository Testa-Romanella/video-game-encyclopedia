So don\u2019t install it!</p>\n<p>I told you there is no game!</p>\n<p>It's not like it\u2019s a Point&amp;Click that won the 2015 Construct Deception Jam, or that millions of people have tried it.</p>\n<p>Of course not!</p>\n<p>And if you\u2019ve never heard of it, now\u2019s the perfect time to go for a walk, read a book... or something\u2026</p>\n<p>WEAK POINTS:</p>\n<p>-It's free, which is a problem when you go to ask for a refund.</p>\n<p>-The voice-over acting is pathetic.</p>\n<p>-Two different endings you\u2019ll never even get to because you\u2019re not going to install it.</p>\n<p>HIGHLIGHTS:</p>\n<p>-Since there's no game, you'll be saving a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Isn't that great?</p>\n<p>WINNER of the DeceptionJam in 2015.<br/><br/>This non-game has not been remade with a new game engine for better performances.<br/>And we haven't included some new enhanced graphics and new voices.<br/><br/>If the game seems too slow, you can switch off the CRT effect in the options to improve the frame rate.<br/><br/>There is no game. There is nothing to do.<br/>Do not tap anywhere. Really.
