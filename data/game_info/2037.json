Yes, a boy and a girl.<br/>\r\nThey are Roxanne and Slayter, the offspring of the legendary Rex Power Colt. They\u2018re as tough as their father, as smart as their mother and the best there ever was at being the best. 12 years on from Vietnam War 2, they're going to Vietnam War 4 to save the day, save freedom, and save the world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDiscover an epic single player experience with the unique combination of competitive, precise, physics-based Trials gameplay- and rather less precise gun toting, balls swinging, neon-drenched Blood Dragon action.<br/>\r\nJourney through a colorful story with warzones in Vietnam, settling scores in Miami, confronting TV heroes in Tokyo and the odd detour into Space. Hell, you\u2019re gonna go to Hell and back. The future is back.
