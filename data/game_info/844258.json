Luna's Lovely Summer (DSLLS)</em> is one part of a planned trilogy of visual novels (VNs), taking place after the events of <em>Dating Sim! Re:Mastered</em>. Unlike my previous projects, this VN has more story and character development put into it, as well as being a commercial project - a first in the 10+ years I've been running Pix\u00e6lSoft.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Despite getting friend-zoned by Luna in <em>Dating Sim! Re:Mastered</em>,  the protagonist decides that he should be \u201cjust friends\u201d with her at  first. It\u2019s still a win for him, as Luna is among the top students in  college and is willing to tutor him for his summer classes. His grades  are already terrible and they could really use a boost from her. Not  only that, but since Luna\u2019s such a sex freak he feels that she could  eventually become his girlfriend. The protagonist thinks it\u2019s all gonna  work out \u2013 he\u2019ll graduate, AND he\u2019ll finally have a girlfriend!\r\n   </p>\n<p>\u2026Not so fast, though!\r\n   </p>\n<p>The protagonist finds himself having to put up with Luna\u2019s  unpredictable antics. She tends to postpone study sessions with him  because if she\u2019s not completely drunk, then she\u2019s busy with her cybersex  sessions! It\u2019s summer, and Luna just wants to have fun before the next  semester starts. Even though he\u2019s tempted to join in with her craziness  and lose his virginity to her, the protagonist\u2019s studies come first. He  begins to doubt if Luna really is at the top of her class\u2026\r\n   </p>\n<p>With your help, can the protagonist improve his grades over the summer\u2026and finally earn himself a girlfriend? <br/></p>\r\nCharacters\r\n\n\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Takes place after the events of <em>Dating Sim!
