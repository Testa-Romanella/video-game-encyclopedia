I'm taking a few elements from Fungi and Bongoes in terms of style but hopefully, this will turn out decent :)</p>\n<p>There will be spikes and mobs in the next few builds and you can already see the spikes when initially spawn in, I haven't added a collision event to the player yet thus you know the spikes don't really do anything right now.<br/><br/>I have to thank Tarodev for their\u00a0 2D Player Controller that modified a wee bit for the project. Here's their itch:\u00a0https://tarodev.itch.io/\u00a0<br/>(The audio is also a default from their controller and will not be the same later on)</p>\n<p>FOR THE ASSETS, I need to thank 9E0 for the player sprite that I recoloured, here's a link to their itch that has some more of their work:\u00a0https://9e0.itch.io/</p>\n<p>The tilesets and background were done by Quintino and are open-source and free to download, they have many other nice pixel-work to look at and their itch is:\u00a0https://quintino-pixels.itch.io/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/1618ca0dab86f2c0a98e0d72d22534cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saheed\u2b50"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
