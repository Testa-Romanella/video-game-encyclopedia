The Barrens is home to many including the roaming corpses of those that fell to the infection caused by the disaster. Those left alive have grouped into factions and fight for control, each with their own goals and ideas. How you choose to survive and who with, is entirely up to you.

Lots of planned content with regular updates <strong>coming soon!</strong></li></ul><br/><h3>Multiplayer</h3><br/>This feature deserves it's own section due to it's importance. Fargone has always been built around the idea of having coop, and it <strong>WILL HAVE COOP SOON</strong>. However, for the launch of the game and the growing complexities of the AI system and others, I have made the decision to hold the launch of coop back until the game has launched and settled. Multiplayer is currently targeted at being a 1-4 player experience. The focus on human AI and factions makes for a strong single player experience at launch that I hope you will love as much as I have creating it!<br/><br/>Join the discord to get in touch!<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T04:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0b/e0b60cd1ce2b6e63a1984e4d3a2857ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 439, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RedDot Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["RedDot Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
