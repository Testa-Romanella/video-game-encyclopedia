It's coded from scratch in JavaScript, and is still in development, so excuse any bugs.\u00a0 I will be updating it whenever I feel like it, so it might not be finished for a while. A lot of the art is hand drawn, some is ripped directly from the internet. I'm still working on attribution, but since I'm not making any money off this, I think I'm okay. But just know this isn't 100% original. If you find any bugs, or have any questions or comments, shoot me an email.\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0</p>\n<p>A and D to move left and right.
