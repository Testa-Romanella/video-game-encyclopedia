{"id": 459303, "slug": "get-nukes", "name": "Get Nukes", "name_original": "Get Nukes", "description": "<p>Game Designed by: Francis E. Rosario<br/>Game Tested by: Vanessa Rivera<br/>\u2022 Favorite moment: Voice Lines. Como momentos en los cuales una voz se rie de ti sabiendo que vas a fallar el juego y sin querer te dice cu\u00e1l es el bot\u00f3n que puedes presionar para salvarte.<br/>\u2022 Changes you would make: It would slow down the Platforming as it is too fast. It would create a Health Point System so that the player had a better chance of winning.<br/>\u2022 Was there anything about gameplay or mechanics that you didn't understand? I didn\u2019t understand the Control Scheme. How to move a character.<br/>\u2022 Describe the player's agency throughout the level: The character can move forward, backward, right and left and can jump.<br/>\u2022 Additional feedback:<br/>The game shows an office where the background includes science fiction items like power coils, huge tubes, lasers, and super computers. Everything is modeled in 3d.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T02:27:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37b/37beda8f809d617fb4c874694ddce561.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CyberCharger"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
