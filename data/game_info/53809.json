It is a mix of the action, platformer, puzzle and shooter genres.</p>\n<p>The player assumes the role of a spy infiltrating a 30-story building filled with elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems can be complex enough that puzzle-solving skills are needed. The controls consist of a four-way joystick and two buttons, one to shoot and the other for jumping and kicking.</p>\n<p>Elevator Action was followed by the arcade game Elevator Action Returns in 1994 (released as Elevator Action II in North America) and Elevator Action EX for the Game Boy Color in 2000.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0e684fd240c803234cb9cdd8cb0e74e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.59, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 12}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 17, "suggestions_count": 201, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 17, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "PlayStation 4", "Wii", "Game Boy", "PC", "Wii U", "NES", "Atari 2600", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Taito", "Micronics"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Taito"], "esrb_rating": null}
