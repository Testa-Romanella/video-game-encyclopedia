{"id": 311870, "slug": "pisti-now", "name": "Pisti NOW!", "name_original": "Pisti NOW!", "description": "Pisti is a quick and enjoyable card game based on counting cards and luck. The game has two basic dynamics in order to reach 51 points: collecting cards and making Pisti. To collect the piled cards on the table, you can throw a card that matches your opponent's last thrown card or you can use the \"J\" cards. For example, if the last card on the table is \"Spade 10\", you can get the pile with any \"J\" or \"10\" card regardless of their type. To make \"Pisti\", there must be only one play card on the table. The value of piled cards on the table increases accumulatively in relation to the points of each individual card. You can find the value of cards below.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T05:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8c/a8ce5ad3129d9ac33ed7b60541cfe4f6.jpg", "website": "http://cuzw.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Foes"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Foes Media LLP"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
