Out of which emerge beasts and monsters that were said to have long been banished. An evil force has brought them back and must be stopped. The three most powerful ruling sorcerers and sorceresses of the age are feeling the impacts of this blight the most. For their kingdoms have been invaded by these monstrosities and they themselves have been transformed into hideous and destructive creatures. If there is to be any hope in defeating this evil, all three kingdoms must be saved by restoring the rulers back to their original forms. In the midst of the ensuing chaos, two legendary heroes arise to take up the call. Destined to forever shoulder the burdens of magic, they are known only as the <strong>Spellbearers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>\n<p>Spellbearers is a top-down, 2D, cooperative, Twin Stick Shooter. The mechanics are inspired by the classic SNES game, \u201cSuper Smash TV\u201d with an atmosphere not unlike the older \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d, \u201cGauntlet\u201d, and \u201cCastlevania\u201d games. The game has a modern look but with a retro feel. It's for all ages but geared toward an older generation who are looking for a game that is wrapped in nostalgia. There are a slew of spells that you collect to power up, ranging from energy grenades that bounce off walls, lightning blasts that unleash devastating chain damage, protective swords made of destructive light, and much, much more! Become the Spellbearer and battle against the hordes of magical enemies to liberate the rulers of three kingdoms that have been overtaken by strong dark forces. With staff in hand, do you have what it takes to uphold the title of The Spellbearer?\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul><li>1-2 player Multiplayer (2 players coming soon)</li><li>Four hours of gameplay</li><li>Lots of explosive visual effects and power-ups</li><li>Action-oriented twin-stick shooter with lots of challenges!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T02:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/123/123becaad2135cefee43ed09d6f0e0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Whim Independent Studios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
