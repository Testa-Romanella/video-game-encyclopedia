But here you are, one match from enlightenment. There is just one problem -- a pair of oddball opponents names Yin and Yang who have seemingly mastered the physics of the sport. Well, two can play at that game. Remember the teaching: \"Become the ball.\"<br/><br/>To play drag the paddle with your finger. Flick the paddle left and right to control direction and spin.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to score 11 points or higher with a 2 point advantage. Service alternates every two points.<br/><br/>Press your score at upper left to bring up the menu. Turn sound off and on, set difficulty easy or hard, change opponents. Press 'go' to resume the game.<br/><br/>Tilt sideways to play in landscape mode.<br/><br/>Win or lose, a fortune cookie awaits at the end. You will soon be back for more.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T06:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/333/333d3644c8c7b3b28a9b938b467fee0c_NQMxZST.jpg", "website": "http://www.resetgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["RESETgame"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": ["RESETgame"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
