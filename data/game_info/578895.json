You don't get paid enough to put up with this! Go go go!\r\nControls:\u00a0 \r\nArrow keys to move.\r\nZ to start game.\r\nEscape key will open a small menu where you can click a restart option.Changes made:The feedback I recieved in the Games Jam was that the player was hard to notice, the hallways were too close together and they'd become stuck, there was too much colour and detail going on making it hard to determine what was trash to be picked up and just the look in general.The changes are:-- Character wearing only light blue, making player easier to see/notice.-- The hallways are wider now (unfortunately the AI enemy \"Anti-masker\" will be a bit slower as it is designed to choose a random direction when it hits a wall, walls further away means less movement, I'll learn better AI in future though, I am new at this lol-- A lot less colour and details on level, making it a lot easier on the eyes lolThank you for the awesome time I had with this games jam! You all did a great job and I enjoyed playing everyone's games!<br/>Twitter: @Kouda_Ha", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-29T06:28:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d870ed04c38f30e2b0a66ff97eaaab0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kouda Ha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
