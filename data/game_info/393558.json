Energy is everything; it is health, power, safety, freedom. As a human player with very limited energy resources you have no choice: you will have to explore the hostile worlds of Interlude and fight for energy!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInterlude is a casual FPS with a very simple game loop: everything is energy. No ammunition, no health bar, no enemy level, only energy. Go explore many worlds and maps to fight against ever more energy-filled enemies. The more enemies you kill, the more energy you gain, the more powerful the weapons you can use, which allows you to destroy even more powerful enemies to gain even more energy! The game currently features 9 levels/maps, 8 different monster types and 10 weapons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-25T02:08:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fab/fabf9076c1a915b274caf0ca1215a432.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Charles de Mauroy"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Charles de Mauroy"], "esrb_rating": null}
