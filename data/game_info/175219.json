Journey to the bottom of the weird caves to collect relics of some mysterious alternative world.</p>\n<p>There's not a whole lot happening here in terms of what the player needs to do, but it allowed me to practice a whole range of things. I put together my own physics-based sidescroller player controller. I made a whole bunch of real low-res pixel art. I used Darius Kazemi's incredible interactive essay about Spelunky's level generation to create my own tile-based level generator. I used this really good guide to make a 'proper' 64x64 resolution game \u00a0(sorta) in Unity which is quite difficult. And I did some other stuff!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow keys - move</p>\n<p>Z - jump/double jump/close dialog box.</p>\n<p>1 - Restart application</p>\n<p>esc - quit</p>\n<p>As always, Windows version untested. Let me know if there are any issues.</p>\n<p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #23 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/851/851b418fd7667707e27cd475929f05c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
