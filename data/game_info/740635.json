I am happy to be able to post a completed PICO-8 game in here!</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I was in a very strong Bambi mood when I started making this game. I've also read the original Bambi novel! Fantastic things.</p>\n<p>It's the main reason I decided to give this game a good ending. It would've been an infinite runner with only dying as a game over.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game made in Pico8</p>\n<p>Design and Programming by KaaSnake</p>\n<p>Music and SFX by KaaSnake</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T08:24:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c24/c24ad5259eda8b076bcea71a064f1a16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["KaaSnake"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
