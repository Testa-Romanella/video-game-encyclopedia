The core thought is that video games should enable rather than proscribe storytelling. As a result, in this co-op game, you both <em>perform </em>characters. The environment slowly changes to give some structure to your interactions, but overall, everything of worth that happens within this framework is player-generated.</p><p>This is only the first prototype, on which I graduated with honors from the Utrecht School of Arts. I plan on iterating heavily on this prototype, adding characters, environments, driving forces and controls. I'm not sure where it'll lead, but I hope that at the very least it may turn out interesting.</p><p>Make sure you have two XBOX controllers plugged in beforehand. The left stick controls head rotation allowing you to express emotions, whereas the X and A buttons are simple arm movements. Use Y for jumping. Press and hold the right shoulder button to sit down.</p><p>NOTE: This is a very rough prototype and far from finished. The controls are still a bit sluggish and require a ton of refinement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c0/1c07b5f643e71c0bf84bcf40184bb3f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ernst-Jan van Melle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
