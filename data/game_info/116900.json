Your aim is to protect the Runestone at the heart of your base from hundreds of enemies with each wave - utilise powerful abilities from different elemental staffs, place defensive structures such as towers to help your cause, and wade into combat with both melee and ranged capabilities. Play the way you want - it's all up to you.</p><p><strong><em>CURRENTLY IN ALPHA. PLEASE READ PATCH NOTES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESCRIPTION.</em></strong></p><p>Follow us on Twitter (@Labyrinth_Int), like us on Facebook (Labyrinth Interactive) and subscribe to our blog for weekly updates on the progress of Unbreakable as it nears the finish (www.labyrinthinteractive.com).</p><p><strong>Patch Notes (Alpha 0.0.3)</strong></p><p><strong>CHARACTERS</strong><br/><strong><em>Felicia</em></strong><br/>Base Health - 100<br/>Base Damage - 5 -&gt; 40<br/>Strength - 50 -&gt; 25<br/>Armour - 18 -&gt; 9<br/>Strength Level Up Multiplier - 2.5<br/>Health Level Up Multiplier - 5<br/>Base Ground Speed - 600 -&gt; 400</p><p><strong><em>Enemy Archer</em></strong><br/>Base Health - 80 -&gt; 50<br/>Base Damage - 0 -&gt; 20<br/>Strength - 10 -&gt; 5<br/>Armour - 5<br/>Strength Level Up Multiplier - 5 -&gt; 2.4<br/>Health Level Up Multiplier - 5 -&gt; 9</p><p><strong><em>Enemy Light</em></strong><strong>Base Health - 140 -&gt; 50</strong><br/>Base Damage - 0<br/>Strength - 30<br/>Armour - 10 -&gt; 5<br/>Strength Level Up Multiplier - 1 -&gt; 1.5<br/>Health Level Up Multiplier - 5 -&gt; 12</p><p><strong><strong><strong><em>Enemy Warlord</em></strong></strong></strong></p><p>Base Health - 5000 -&gt; 250<br/>Base Damage - 0 -&gt; 10<br/>Strength - 50<br/>Armour - 5<br/>Strength Level Up Multiplier - 1 -&gt; 3<br/>Health Level Up Multiplier - 200</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><em>Enemy Martyr</em></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p>Blast Radius - 500<br/>Explosion Damage - 50</p><p><strong><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></strong></p><p><strong><br/>- The Runestone Shards - we felt the walls of Ellental\u2019s Fortress were too safe.  25% of the Crystal\u2019s health is now in No Man\u2019s Land in the form the Runestone Shard.  On top of that, they are prime targets for enemy Dracorian Martyrs, who will happily lay down their lives for the good of the Dracorian cause.</strong></p><p>- Wall Towers - we also thought it was a bit too hard, especially at low levels when you cant really afford to spam towers.  There are 8 powerful, wall mounted static turrets on the map that deal 25% damage, so they\u2019re pretty much always useful.  We noticed there were distinct lines of defence, the outer walls and the inner walls, so there are four turrets on each.</p><p>- Destructibles - Various elements of the map are now fully destructible.  Outer barricades can and will be targeted by enemy units, blowing them up.  This functionality might be extended to buyable turrets, depends on how sadistic we\u2019re feeling.</p><p>- Weapon Swapping - You're now able to switch weapons, allowing you to use both staffs on the fly. Simply press Q and E respectively to switch between each weapon.</p><p><strong>Weapons</strong><br/><strong><em>Water Staff</em></strong><br/>The Water Staff is very much focused on displacement and moving enemies, with strong defensive and healing capabilities.</p><p><strong><strong>- Bubble Shield </strong>-</strong> Felicia surrounds herself in a bubble that makes her competely immune from taking damage (apart from status effects) as long as she stays inside of it.<br/><strong>- </strong><strong>Heal</strong><strong> - </strong>Felicia heals herself or nearby allies in times of need...which is practically all of the time<br/><strong>-Tidal Wave</strong><strong> -</strong> The Tidal Wave pushes enemies back in a cone, applying a significant slow in the process.<br/><strong>- Oceanic Stun </strong><strong>-</strong> A Wave travels across the ground and throws enemies into the air, applying fall damage, true damage and slows them to a crawl.</p><p><strong><em>Earth Staff</em></strong><br/>This staff is for the more offensively inclined.  While the Water Staff is geared towards movement and displacement, the Earth Staff is designed for those who want to get in amongst their Dracorian foes.</p><p><strong><strong>- Earth Wall -</strong> </strong>An earthen wall is summoned from the ground, creating a temporary obstacle, blocking in the enemy, or simply buying time.<br/><strong>- </strong><strong>Protect</strong><strong> - </strong>Felicia is surrounded by 5 stone wards that will protect her from 5 damage inducing hits.<br/><strong>- </strong><strong>Ground Smash</strong><strong> - </strong>Felicia throws herself into the air and come crashing down at a location of her choosing, dealing AOE damage.  The higher she throws herself, the more damage she will do and the further she can travel.<br/><strong>-</strong><strong> Meteor Shower </strong><strong>- </strong>Firey balls of stone rain from the sky, decimating all who\u2019re unlucky enough to be in its area of effect.</p><p><strong>Enemies</strong><br/>- Implementation of the Dracorian Martyr class; this unit seeks out destroyable battlements and buildings.</p><p><strong>Waves</strong><br/>- Enemies now spawn at a more appropriate level - no more OP Felicia, no more squishy dracorians (sorry).</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes- </strong>Players who played before previous balancing patches can no longer take advantage of the none-updated statistics.  Save files made before the patch retained the players statistics.  A level 15 Felicia now has 323 strength, instead of 1200 or whatever. I\u2019d like to say i'm sorry for the inconvenience, but that would be a bit of a lie.</p><p><strong><strong>-</strong> Shooting a tower as it was being built, or encroaching upon it would cause it to stop being built.  It now pushes enemies out of the way so it can be built, as well as up and taking projectile damage like a man and getting on with it.</strong></p><p>- Pathfinding has been improved by adding additional collision data</p><p><strong>Words from the Lead Tech</strong><br/>Hey everyone! You may have noticed this patch is a bit hefty compared to the last one - the enemies are actually hard, Felicia is actually pretty soft, and your turret placement is more important than ever.  Luckily, Martyrs don't blow your turrets up (we\u2019re umming and arring over that), so make sure you buy em! You\u2019ll need them.<br/>Secondly, you might also notice a MASSIVE rework of the combat system, namely abilities.  Felicia, being the element wielding maverick that she is, will be bring the power of water and earth to the battlefield\u2026.splish splashing about.  Thanks to Phil Lewis and Lewis Brotchie for their hard work!  In that regard, if they\u2019re broken, its their fault.<br/>This is by no means the last patch, and we\u2019ll continue working and improving, adding and creating as long as we can, so keep your eyes peeled for additional weapons, abilities and enemies!<br/>As always, feel free to contact us through social media or email us direct, comment on the Desura page or post on our personal forums at\u00a0www.labyrinthinteractive.com, or even email us at justlabyrinthinteractive@gmail.com. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5c/f5cdc5ddf6ad3a979406c86f2f11761f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Labyrinth_Int"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
