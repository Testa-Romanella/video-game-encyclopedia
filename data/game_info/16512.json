While exploring the upstairs study one night, she and her friend Melody accidentally unleash a flirtatious demon named Lyria, who spent the past fifty years in a stone. After freeing her from her prison, the two become attached by a \u2018lifestone\u2019, which means Lyria can\u2019t go far from Aria without feeling repercussions, and vice versa.  Now Aria, an ordinary highschool girl, must find a way to free herself from Lyria, who seems to crave the exact opposite. Add to that the increasingly realistic dreams plaguing Aria, the sexual tension between Aria and a select few girls around her, and the supernatural phenomena - it seems like Aria's life will never be the same again.<br/><br/><br/>The game is available on PC, Mac, and Linux.
