Where are you and what are you doing here? Then it floods back to you, you are INSIDE Area 51. You made it in with your four other friends but, where are they now. It is your job to explore the different areas of Area 51 to find your four other friends before it is too late. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this top down RPG you explore different areas and rooms to find better weapons and potions to fight against bigger and bigger bosses. Each area has its own unique layout and enemies. As you fight through hoards of monsters such as robots and aliens you level up and become stronger, preparing you for the four unique boss battles at the end of each area.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n(AAStudios in no way encourages users to storm Area 51. This game is satire and should be treated as such.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/7426cbd2614b3e77bbe2581aeb49ce3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Justin Beiber", "Beach Boi"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Actually Awesome Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
