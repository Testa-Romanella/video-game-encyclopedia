Soon you will discover how to change color and that each color has it own ability. Using them you will reach your first trophy, after that more guiding symbols will appear but also the clock will start running! Take the other 7 trophies as fast as you can!</p>\n<p>Although there is little indications of the controls in-game, inside the zip file there is a file named controls.txt that have all the key bindings, both for keyboard and joystick. Keep in mind that a joystick is highly recommended to play.</p>\n<p>The game is still a little demo that can be played in half-a-minute but I plan to add more features and eventually make a non-demo version of the game. It started as a small project for the Miz Jam 1 and to starting using Godot but I got attached to it ^^</p>\n<p>The color palette was thought to address (most of the types of) colorblindness. You can get all the files to compile/edit/test the game by your own in the source file. All the art, except for the player, is from https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-08T04:16:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/1401f9c5a75d5916c7a3fe63c6f3b593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dexint"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
