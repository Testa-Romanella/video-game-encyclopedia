You (who are supposedly tow people) have 5 seconds to determine what sequence of actions (which happens to be translation, rotation and scaling) would put the broken piece to where it's supposed to be. Then you confirm the sequence of inputs and what follows is the resolution of your possibly wrong decisions. You'll cuk or cukn't. Oh god this layout sucks.</p>\n<p>[KEYBOARD CONTROLS]:\u00a0<br/>[P1: WASD / Space] [P2: Arrow keys / Enter]\u00a0</p>\n<p>[XBOX CONTROLLER CONTROLS]:<br/>[P1: ABXY / Start] [P2: A-Y / LB-RB / Start]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:16:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/695/695a891cfa30d97cfb8e5b7cfe0b4124.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Enes Ugur Sekerci"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
