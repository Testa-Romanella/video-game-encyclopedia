In RaceStars, I have developed the ability to control a car giving me a full arcade-style action; it has a full race AI system to challenge my competitors; you can unlock tracks over time by winning races; there are different types of cars to race against; managing audio systems; designing my own complete custom tracks and a full user interface with interactive menus. This game is for anyone who wants to make games.\u00a0</p><p>The coding that I used for the programme RaceStars was C#. I already knew the capabilities of 3D development in Unity; I developed a secure and transferrable skill in problem-solving. Gaining and learning both game development and object-oriented programming throughout this game helped a lot.<br/></p><p>Controls: W or Up Arrow (Accelerate),\u00a0 A or Left Arrow (Turn left), S or Down Arrow (Reverse), D or Right Arrow (Turn right). C is to change the camera.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T06:06:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d83/d837ea89b9785734edaa6b9df08d316d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
