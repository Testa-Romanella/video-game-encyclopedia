Per hairdresser's shop <strong>ONLY ONE</strong> guy at the time can get a haircut. Your task is to get everyones hair cut (of course\u00a0not really, because the game is an Endless Runner). If you\u00a0successfully do haircuts you will be rewarded with coins so you can build more hairdresser's shops. If a hairdresser's shop is occupied and someone else tries to get in: one of your hearts (=lives)\u00a0gets removed. If you have no hearts left the game is over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:00:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/647/6470c8c7ecae06b0ae2fb6b9e8ed7927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nik2434"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
