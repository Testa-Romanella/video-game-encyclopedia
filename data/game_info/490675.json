You can experience the Demo first. If the Demo is fun, then consider buying the full version. The full version can experience more levels, more weapons, and more bosses.</li></ul>Every level has brand new weapons, brand new enemies, brand new bosses, so every level is a brand new feeling. This is an independent game, developed for more than 2 years, the development costs by the team members to borrow money to make up. Due to the shortage of funds, the development process has been interrupted many times, very difficult. Hopefully it will be the best action VR game in your mind.If you have any ideas, please let us know, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.
