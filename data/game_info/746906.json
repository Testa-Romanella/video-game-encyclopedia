{"id": 746906, "slug": "puppet-encore", "name": "Puppet Encore", "name_original": "Puppet Encore", "description": "<p>This is a short story game submitted for the <strong>2022.1 Brackey's Game Jam</strong>.<br/></p><p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p><p>So I\u00a0noticed a pretty bad bug that is ruining people's experience with the game. I\u00a0forgot to make the projectiles not framerate dependent. So they behave differently on everyone's PC which means if you are on a lower end pc, or high end pc the projectiles reflect that and makes it incredibly hard to fight the skeletons as parrying their attacks are the way they were meant to be defeated.<br/><br/>If this starts to bother you a bunch I\u00a0highly recommend just rushing the key. When the jam is over I will fix this.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WASD </strong>- To move around.</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Pick up and throw items.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>F</strong> - Skip through Dialogue.</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse </strong>- Attacks and Parries Projectiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>A Short First-Person Slasher Game, where you play as a puppet in a puppet show!</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Interpretation:</strong></p>\n<p>The theme for this jam was \"It is not real\" which had me stuck for ideas for awhile but I eventually thought of how acting is all fake, and I\u00a0had recently read an SCP article that had to do with Paper Mache puppets and that's how I\u00a0got the idea.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The real interpretation is how the entire game and all the combat and adventure you do is all fake, its purely to amuse an audience. However the story ties this in. Along with the fact that you control a puppet that can be pulled by the strings to go upward.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All the music done in this game is from:\u00a0https://xdeviruchi.itch.io/8-bit-fantasy-adventure-music-pack<br/>This pack seriously saved my life when it comes to music, go check it out. Its <strong><em>FREE</em></strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:12:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebe/ebe00df27760119af93a72bb604bdb53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BigPapaOcnarf123"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
