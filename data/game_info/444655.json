It's a mess of ad hoc workarounds and abandoned ideas that I never took out for fear that it would break the game.</p>\n<p>I have to thank all of the great YouTubers who taught me Godot, especially Miziziziz, HeartBeast, GDquest and Kidscancode. There are many more, but I don't even know who all I referred to in making this game. Also a thank you to anyone who answers Godot questions in the forum. Saved me more time and headaches than I thought possible.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T03:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5c/e5ce6a6c1117c7e4cf6637a955cf4532.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Chris Anderson"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
