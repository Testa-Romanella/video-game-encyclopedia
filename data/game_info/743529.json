{"id": 743529, "slug": "free-cities", "name": "Free Cities", "name_original": "Free Cities", "description": "<p>This is a basic text-only erotic game in Twine 2, specifically in the Sugarcube story format. It&#39;s a procedural narrative generator; rather than erotic games you may have played with set characters and plot, it&#39;s an open world in which the player, a wealthy slave owner, can indulge themselves.</p>\n<p>The excuse plot of the game is that it&#39;s twenty minutes into the future, and the beginnings of environmental and societal collapse have led some wealthy people to carve out little extra national enclaves called Free Cities. Think modern city states, but following an extreme kind of anarcho-capitalism. Don&#39;t worry, the mild futurism gets the hell out of the way after two screens and lets the player get on with the fun. The list of kinks included is way too long to give here, but includes a lot of extreme stuff like involuntary surgical alteration, sexual slavery, and most other things associated with slavery fantasies. I am doing my best to segregate content out so that the player won&#39;t be blindsided by things they didn&#39;t sign up for; notably, there is content for slaves with dicks, but this can be turned off at game start.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-23T16:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd0/bd0807534e864aa5b2998c3a0eb57e68.jpg", "website": "https://tfgames.site/?module=viewgame&id=751", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
