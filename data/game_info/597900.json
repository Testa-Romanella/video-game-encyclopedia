Its an adventure/puzzle game made using Phaser 3. This is my\u00a0first game using the framework. Previously I had been using Game Maker Studio though I had played around in Godot before going with Phaser finding the small footprint attractive.\u00a0I drew the graphics with the Windows 7 version of mspaint and the limited myself to the default palette. Paint.net was used\u00a0to add transparency. In the past two jams I've done more precise pixel art and it was nice doing something more free hand.<br/></p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Mouse over items for a description and left click to interact with them.</p>\n<p>Left click on an item in the\u00a0inventory\u00a0to equip it.</p>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>Graphics &amp; code by me.</p>\n<p>Generic pickup sound by slamaxu</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/slamaxu/sounds/509879/</p>\n\n<p>Walk In The Park Full by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative\u00a0</p>\n<p>Commons Attribution 4.0 license.\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</p>\n<p>Artist: http://audionautix.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T05:47:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c55/c55389444afc1b24ba0832d6990fc92c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dabski"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
