Raise the most terrifying army the world has ever seen, by choosing from despicable creatures such as orcs, succubae, zombies and much, much more. Then, once you have built your forces, emerge from the darkness and guide your army to the light of the overworld, where you will corrupt the land and dispatch anything even vaguely heroic, cute or unicorn-shaped. And in a first for the Dungeons series, experience randomly generated levels, so that no two sessions are alike \u2013 never-ending fun for any evil conqueror!</p>", "metacritic": 74, "released": "2017-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T18:46:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e256a7643dca3065b7ff1dcc4c7650d.jpg", "website": "http://www.kalypsomedia.com", "rating": 3.26, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 191, "owned": 1411, "beaten": 37, "toplay": 12, "dropped": 48, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 242, "ratings_count": 112, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 113, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PlayStation 4", "macOS", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Kalypso Media", "Realmforge Studios"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kalypso Media"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
