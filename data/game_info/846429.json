A security guard put on ice, only to be thawed in case of EXTREME emergency, you wake up with one thought in mind........killing. <br/><br/>With the help of a tech expert, Art, you need to make your way through this lab from the pits of hell and put a stop to these monsters.<h3>CLASSIC FPS CONTROLS</h3>Looking up is overrated anyways. If you are here for a classic FPS feel, you're in the right hands. Don't worry, we took all the feel of a classic Boomer Shooter and jammed packed it with the speed and high paced gameplay of modern shooters. It's a Frankenstein and you'll love it.<h3>FULL ARSENAL</h3>Six weapons with dramatically different mechanics. Wanna shoot grapple lasers? Got it! Wanna unload a full mag into some eyeball? Got that too! What about a tried and true shotgun? Oh you know we wouldn't leave that out.<h3>THREE GRUSOME ACTS</h3>Kick monster ass through three acts, 15 levels, and 3 unique bosses. There is something not right on in this testing facility, will you get to the bottom of it? Who cares, you're here to leave a pile of bodies on your way out.<h3>CHALLENGE MODE</h3>Test your weapon mastery in a challenge mode. Race against the clock to beat a procedurally generated set of 5 levels with endless combinations. Did I mention, you only get 1 weapon.....good luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T06:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92c/92cefe0c5e2d9467cf1020f479ee9276.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/arctosgames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Arctos Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Arctos Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
