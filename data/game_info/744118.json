When, all of a sudden, there is a break in. You sneak to see what\u2019s going on. The government is there and kidnaps your entire family!\r\n</p>\n<p>You find out where they\u2019re going, and follow them.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This is where you find out the government wants information from them, and after they\u2019re done, they\u2019ll kill them. They want to get your family into a simulated world, where they\u2019ll forget the night, and get the information. They say something about not messing up the simulations because if they do, then they\u2019ll wake up from the simulations.\r\n</p>\n<p>So, you must save them.\r\n</p>\n<p>However, first you need to find a way to not forget the night, and go into the simulation(s).\r\n</p>\n<p>You find out that the government is going in too, to find out the information. They produced an injection that makes you remember the night. \r\n</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This was, unfortunately, rushed. Had 2-4 days to complete this demo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The original artist didn't work out, so I had to go out and find a new one. This was the main reason behind it being rushed through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I had planned out a story, enemy cycles, a boss fight too, but unfortunately, as you may have seen at the end of the demo, that didn't happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, I'm sorry if this demo has bugs. Didn't have time to test it out with anyone.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T06:26:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9f/e9fcee06f9d6f0b1c936ed034470afe8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrKnd94"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
