It was suppose to be simple enough to understand and easy enough to learn. Although this project was never used for what it was made for because I had to withdraw from teaching it due to certain circumstances. So I decided to upload it here on Itch. This game was made with C++ and SFML library for PCs using Windows OS.</p>\n<p>Its a very simple game where you control a pad and hit as many ball as possible while trying not to miss any corrupt balls in attempt to get as much score as possible. Blobs show up from time to time and you can kill them through hitting them with the balls. You can put the game on slow motion with your special ability when things start getting difficult. There are pick-ups in the game, both good and bad. Obstacles may fall from the top of the screen from time to time to reduce the player's visibility. I hope you enjoy it :)</p>\n<p>Below you'll find two links to both download the actual game and the source code of the game(if you want to study or see how it was made).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffa/ffa8f2b1618205798c2d7fbb0d12b339.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Isenah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
