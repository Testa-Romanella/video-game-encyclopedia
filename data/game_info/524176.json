As The Dog, you'll need to jump across gaps and blocks, shift through dimensions to traverse the landscape, and collect all of the coins before reaching the end of the level. While The Dog can switch between 2D and 3D, he loses his ability to jump while doing so, so you'll have to use your brain to get around!\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:04:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd2/bd211a2d2ee8f0aede0ecdd41af001ed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GamesFromTheSoul"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
