A curse has been brought upon this land, to shroud it in darkness forever. Adventurers from far and wide come here to rest, and go on their journeys, but lately they can't leave, because wherever they go, they come back to the town - or worse - DIE!</p>\n<p>Will you and your party be the chosen ones to save this town and yourselves?</p>\n<p>Current pre-alpha build only contains 1 quest and 1 dungeon - we plan to do at least 4-part quest to get rid of the darkness in near future! Stay tuned!</p>\n<p>We made this game during Core Game Creator Challenge during the last 3 days.</p>\n<p>Please join our discord and give us any feedback or suggestions! This will be a wild ride!</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/tb3brwAmjE</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>jdzsk<br/>a-Ferox<br/>MermaladeJar</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:34:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f4b/f4b29107bf26354aab51e6cef9d8d76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J\u0101nis Skuja"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
