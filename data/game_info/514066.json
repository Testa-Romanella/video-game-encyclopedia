I've decided to release these to the public in celebration of the one year anniversary since the release of Boofie's Bunker!</p>\n\n<p>Oh No! It's MOM!</p>\n<p>You're the IT guy at the office and the boss's Windows laptop is infected by some sort of virus that causes it to act all loopy if left idle. That one Windows maze screensaver comes up, but something about it is... Off. It's your job to remove the virus. This is your only project for the day. If you finish it early, then you get to go home early! Neat!</p>\n<p>MOM is an idea that originated during a bet I made in a Tee-K-O match on Jackbox back on a friend's stream. The game is heavily inspired by those old Windows maze screensavers. Everything you need is in the README, so make sure you read it!</p>\n\n<p>Lanky's Bunker</p>\n<p>What if Lanky Lonky invaded Boofie's Bunker? The legendary crossover that everyone's been waiting for is finally here! Boofie's Bunker x Lanky Lonky!</p>\n<p>The controls, mechanics and objectives are the same as the original Boofie's Bunker map! Find the keys, match them to the doors and escape the bunker! If you're still unsure on how to complete this, check out Boofie's Bunker for a basic run-down on what to do!</p>\n\n<p>Back-Alley Slasher</p>\n<p>You play as a dude named Dan. Dan Cybert. He's stranded in the big city and has run out of gas. The only logical solution to this problem is to traverse the sketchy and obviously dangerous back-alley area of the city and scavenge for conveniently placed gas cans in the surrounding area. Find all eleven gas cans and return to your car to win! Beware, the Back-Alley Slasher is at large, and is on the hunt. He will chase you if he thinks you're vulnerable. Don't let him catch you!</p>\n<p>This game was made in celebration of Halloween and was meant to be the scariest game that I've ever created. It's scary. It's fast paced. It's difficult. It's simple. You know it's a hard game when there is a death counter on the main menu. Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>Tuffum's Lair</p>\n<p>Tuffum has captured you and locked you inside of his lair. Work your way through the four sections of this dungeon by flipping levers that can be found throughout the map. Reach the exit and escape! It's just you and Tuffum, so don't let him catch you!</p>\n<p>This game was made in two days as a sort of \"bonus game\" since I was unable to finish the planned fourth game on time for this bundle, so now everyone gets five games! It is meant to be fast-paced and hectic throughout the gameplay, but not quite as difficult as Back-Alley Slasher.</p>\n\n<p>Boofie's Birthday Adventure</p>\n<p>Boofie's Birthday Adventure is still in development and will be added to this bundle within the next couple of weeks! The original bundle didn't include Tuffum's Lair and was originally going to be just four games. I decided to take a little more time to give Boofie's Birthday Adventure the love that it deserves in order to be a tip-top experience for everyone. Sorry for the wait, and thanks for your support!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/874/874afeaeb92e21739507d826acc7a3c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroHorrorArcade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
