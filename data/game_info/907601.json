This was a solo project in which we were tasked to make a 2.5d game, and adding some unique elements of our own.</p>\n<p><strong>--- instructions ---</strong></p>\n<p>The starting menu of the game explains itself quite well, these are simple buttons you can click on using your cursor.</p>\n<p>You can control your character using the arrow keys or WASD. I would advice using the arrow keys with your right hand\u00a0as your abilities are bound to Z, X, C and V, which you can use with your left hand.</p>\n<p>The character is also able to jump using spacebars.</p>\n<p>Light attack - Z is an attack that\u00a0allows you to destroy objects, with the exception of a dark gray wall.</p>\n<p>Heavy attack - C is an attack that allows you to break dark gray walls.</p>\n<p>Both attacks flash a red sphere, this indicates the size of the attack. the sphere will remain visible as long as the attack is also active.</p>\n<p>Sprint - X allows you to briefly run at high speeds, use this to cross long gaps.</p>\n<p>Super jump - C allows you to jump great heights, use this to jump onto high ledges.</p>\n<p>All abilities have a cooldown, the indicator at the bottom of the screen will appear once the ability is ready to be used.</p>\n<p><strong>--- mechanics ---</strong></p>\n<p>The game is quite simple, the prototype level highlights all mechanics currently available.</p>\n<p>White blocks are purely part of the map.</p>\n<p>Light grey blocks are able to be destroyed using a light attack (Z)</p>\n<p>Dark grey blocks are able to be destroyed using a heavy attack (C)</p>\n<p>Light blue blocks are clouds, they will disappear shortly after standing on them. So you need to continue quickly.</p>\n<p>Colored blocks unlock abilities when destroyed, the ability is then displayed with the corresponding color at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<p>The green block is the end goal, destroy it to achieve victory.</p>\n<p><strong>--- art ---</strong></p>\n<p>This game is nowhere close to a visual masterpiece. the 3d model for the player character was an asset provided to me by my school.</p>\n<p>This being my first 3d project I had not yet learned to use character animators, so the player is always running in place.</p>\n<p><strong>--- potential improvements ---</strong></p>\n<p>This prototype currently has no planned updates, as a first project it leaves much to be desires. I will still name some potential improvements and additions to the game.</p>\n<p>Quantity. The game could use more levels that challenge the players intuition and problem solving skills in unique ways. Potentially this could introduce new gimmicks, or start the player with a different ability. New scenario's would certainly spice up the game. and would make users continue playing.</p>\n<p>I would also definitely add a character animator now that I have learned how to use one, also other assets for visual improvements, and reworking the HUD for the abilities.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T06:12:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/867/8671ae04f6a20b7363af0479756289dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Grc0"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
