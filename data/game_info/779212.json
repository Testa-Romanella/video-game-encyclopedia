I made this for a school project which was meant to just be a math questioner but over the term break it got alot larger in scope. This is a demo and I probably wont work on it anymore since I didn't use a game engine for it. All it's using is python and pythons PIL (python imaging library) and\u00a0pygame to handle the music and sounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f6c42c938d778008c3f7045fa724ac.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SirBumbo"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
