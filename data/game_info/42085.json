Tell me more!<br/>\r\n\"Drum to the beat of the music to move your orc across the battle field and launch attacks by banging on weaponized drums.\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDrums of War uses a unique locomotion system where players must bang drums to the beat of the music to walk most effectively. Get off of the beat and then your orc will start to turn to one side. You can also bang on the side drums to turn allowing for full 360 degrees of movement. But your drums are also a powerful arsenal of weapons. The two center drums fire off destructive cannonballs when hit and you can also aim on stick and tap it with the other to throw fireballs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T02:20:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c1/4c1b57aea8f6bd0aeb341bb02173612b.jpg", "website": "http://www.crasleen.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432", "Grind Core Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Slitherine", "Grind Core Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
