{"id": 546370, "slug": "flatlander-janblu-poggio", "name": "Flatlander (Janblu Poggio)", "name_original": "Flatlander (Janblu Poggio)", "description": "<p>A puzzle game involving you, a Flatlander, learning how to navigate puzzles set by Spacelander scientists, making use of an entirely new dimension to you, the third dimension...</p>\n<p>Status</p>\n<p>Currently under development, with only 7 levels up and running.</p>\n<p>Sprites and art are concepts and placeholders. It will all be subject to change.</p>\n<p>More features to come</p>\n<p>No sound design yet</p>\n<p>1 temporary animation, more to come</p>\n<p>UI overhaul needed</p>\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Up and Down arrow keys - Switching between \"height\"</p>\n<p>esc/p - pause menu</p>\n<p>Please Note</p>\n<p>The game is still in development, as such, many things are not fully fleshed out. You may find you need to manually exit the game at certain points. Please report any crashes so I can look into them.<br/>The game is being built in MacOS and as such, I cannot guarantee the Windows version runs smoothly if at all, <strong>I have no control over this</strong>.</p>\n<p>Inspirations</p>\n<p>There are currently three main inspirations for the game. The first is the book \"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions\" which inspired the universe and setting (Will be worked on and shown once I get to doing audio and animations). The second is the game \"Portal 2\", only because I hadn't played Portal yet(playing that now don't yell at me). They inspire the theme and also partially the setting, as well as the use of the concept.</p>\n<p>The third inspiration comes from when I was working on my other visual game, \"Waves of Emotion\". I used a developer's shortcut to jump between levels to test things out and realized the player character didn't move when I did that. It kickstarted a thought where I could go through the levels in a more \"puzzle-like\" way by switching between them to get to the end of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T08:31:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d770083ab956ad7a0b4b8ec5b9516c17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Janblu Poggio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
