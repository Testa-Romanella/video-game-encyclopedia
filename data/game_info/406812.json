However, you still try your best.</p>\n<p>This game was\r\ndesigned by Xavier Ponds as a submission to the WOWIE! 2.0 game jam\r\nwith the theme \u2018Intentional Bugs\u2019. The theme was used in the game\r\nthrough the factory controls, which can be set to ridiculous values\r\nthat results in a little destruction. </p>\n<p>Bugs can appear by not clamping your values correctly and this is what we see\r\noccur in the game! Try Leaving the controls on max for a while???</p>\n<p>The game runs for\r\nabout 3-4 min and is simply a fun little scene, I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys.</p>\n<p>WOWIE!!!!!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-24T04:53:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/8197ba23b6c31fb6024798efb0c4053f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ponds"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
