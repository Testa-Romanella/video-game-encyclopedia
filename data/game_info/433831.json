Your campfire is your companion and only hope for rescue. If fed, it will provide light for you to search the area for supplies. Build it up high enough to be noticed by the rescue chopper and you just might survive the night.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Click on the ground to walk there</li><li>Click on an item to pick it up</li><li>Click and hold to drag an item out of your inventory to where you want it to go and then release.</li></ul>\r\nTips\r\n<ul><li>Be quick! The fire will die down over time.</li><li>Bigger wood = bigger fire. Try to burn the biggest pieces of fuel you can find, but be careful not to smother the fire with something too big!</li><li>Try exploring in all directions. Burn enough big branches to grow the light to the farthest reaches - that's\u00a0where logs can be found.\r\n</li><li>If you burn up all the good stuff and want to try again, use the water bucket.</li></ul>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<ul><li>Alex Davis: Art</li><li>Noah Dietterich: Music + Sound Design</li><li>Ryan Hansen: Programming + Game Design</li><li>Brandon Quinn: Programming</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T06:55:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b56/b5607b70e85d8c4857780b70fe224479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["madbarron", "aboogoost"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
