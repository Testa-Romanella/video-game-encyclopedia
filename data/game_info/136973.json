Douglas is not fond of fighting and is wise to avoid mad droids. He can explore his surroundings and interact with the environment.

He must use his mind to outsmart his opponents.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - movement</li><li>LMB - select item in inventory section</li><li>E - interact/use selected item</li><li>Q - drop selected item</li></ul>\n\n<p>Note: we are a team of students.
