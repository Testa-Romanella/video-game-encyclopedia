For this FSM I wanted to make a simple little game where you can place tents and have workers gathering resources.</p>\n<p>Eventually I decided to just make it into a showcase of my FSM in action. There is NO ACTUAL GAMEPLAY. You can fly around and look at the Workers doing their job on a cute little floating Island I made.</p>\n<p>Source Code:<br/>https://github.com/JaydeeAlkema</p>\n<p>The entire development of this game can be found on my Youtube channel:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoY12tD2MzKx260XkMlKEnyelCN_yV_u9</p>\n<p>The development of this game was live streamed at:<br/>https://www.twitch.tv/zejaydee</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T03:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bd/9bdf526231627c72824044a88bda1fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jaydee"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
