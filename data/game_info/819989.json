I'm Gonna Be Late For Dinner!", "description": "<p>Controls: Arrow Keys to move, Space to Dash/Attack/Roll!<br/><br/>The full moon is out and Samir got out of class late! Help them hurry home so that their mom doesn't lecture them about letting the dinner get cold!!</p>\n<p>If Samir gets hurt by the bullies on the way, they will turn into a werewolf quicker, but be careful about attacking them: the lust for blood may make them lose control too! <br/></p>\n<p>Each Die represents a stage of Samir's transformation, from a d12 to a d4. The closer to the d4, the closer to losing control, so be aware of the risks: rolling a one on any die as you attack will bring you one die down. But don't worry, there is also a chance of getting your die back by rolling the highest number on the die! <br/></p>\n\n<p>This is Nihilo Games' submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, made from scratch in 48h!
