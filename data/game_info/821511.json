However, if there are any dice vertically or horizontally adjacent to the die you just placed, they will re-roll.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>This game was made solo, for the GTMK game jam 2022. I made the game in Godot, and I made the dice and pencil assets in blender.</p>\n<p>This is my first game-jam, and I have limited game-dev experience. I'm really happy with my game, simple as it is. Seeing a small project through to completion has been a great experience.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this little puzzle. See if you can get a score above 90!</p><p>Here is a link to my messy repo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f7/0f740d43e9bfb93d2414dd298b5b5f8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CarapaceonBear"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
