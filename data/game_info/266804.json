{"id": 266804, "slug": "dasher-3d", "name": "Dasher 3D", "name_original": "Dasher 3D", "description": "<p>This game is a top down shooter with time-freezing. And it's controlled with only one button as it's a part of Feldo's 1-Button Jam!</p>\n<p>You are the Dasher, a lonely sprite that shoots and well... dashes around. A group of angry bots have attacked you in huge numbers, but you can do something that they can't: Control the time! As you dash around and stop, time freezes and lets you decide to either shoot, or dash again.</p>\n\n<p>How to play and short points:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Dash around by holding the main button or mouse click</p>\n<p>\u2022 Shoot the enemies by pressing the main button or mouse click.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Watch out! enemies can shoot too, each live you lose makes you gain less score from kills.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Think before you move. You have 2 options each time you freeze, but one might make that the last.</p>\n\n<p>Trivia and known problems:</p>\n<p>\u2666 There is no instructions. You will be thrown straight into the game as you would in later plays. We will add that pretty soon.</p>\n<p>\u2666 Robots are stupid pieces of dummies. There isn't very much AI for the robots at this moment, they won't guess your moves, they won't judge the lasers, And they even kill themselves! Expect better intelligence in the updates...</p>\n<p>\u2666 You can boost! Shooting in the wall while facing it (90 degrees) makes you bounce from the explosion and shoot like max payne while moving!</p>\n<p>\u2666 After you die, Robots start screwing around and kill each other :)))</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0The game is currently under development but in updates we'll add more (and bigger) maps, skins, bosses and different weapons. But for now, as any early access game would be, there is just the main core of the game!</p>\n<p>Thanks for downloading!
