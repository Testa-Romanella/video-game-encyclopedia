It's abandoned now, so there will be no more updates. Download with caution. My future projects, which won't be part of a game jam, will have much more care put into them!</strong></p><p>Ephem is a short turn-based RPG about a criminal thrown into the depths of a cursed dungeon. He tries to fight his way out, but he can't do it alone. He'll need to employ the help of a stranger who he meets deep underground.</p><p> But not every area is accessible to both characters, so the player will have to switch between playing both to continue through the dungeon. And with the horrifying monsters lurking about, it isn't safe to go alone!</p><p>Gameplay is about an hour long. I made this game with the help of Pyromantic who did the tileset and Hogwash who did icon art and skill animations!</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Arrows keys to move.</p><p>Z to continue and to interact with things.</p><p>X to cancel or bring up the menu.</p><p>You can also click on stuff.</p><p>Changelog:</p><p>0.2 - Reduced game size and fixed a bug that disallowed the player from re-entering an area if they didn't complete a puzzle.</p><p><em>There's still a bug where it seems if you put the barrels in correctly but in a strange order, nothing will happen even if you did it right. Try re-arranging which barrels go on which spot and see if something happens.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/140/14013a41fbf7bf724551236429e51de4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["rozel"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
