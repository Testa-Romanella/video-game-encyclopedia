Our beloved raindrinker hosted my game for you all, it can be found at\u00a0https://bromine.raindrinker.com/<br/><br/>My sincerest apologies as to not\u00a0having things hosted immediately\u00a0after the game jam ended. I submitted my game files prior to the end of the jam, to prove to you all that I\u00a0did not improve it after the this event\u00a0came to its conclusion. I\u00a0would have hosted it earlier, but I\u00a0was pressed for time, as people often are during game jams. I hope you will stay your vote until after you are able to play the game. Thank you!<br/><br/>Bromine, is, of course, the 35 element in the periodic table. In reality, it's some reddish smelly gas, but I found its name\u00a0to be\u00a0quite interesting. For this game jam, I\u00a0drew inspiration from this element's name, but not the properties of the element itself, breaking the name into two pieces -- \"Bro\" and \"Mine\", and made a game in which your mine your \"bros\".<br/><br/>In this game, you are equipped with naught but a pickax, and are tasked with mining your\u00a0similarly equipped kin.\u00a0 Your pickax is several times larger than you are, and serves as your only mode of transportation. (I've been told this system of propulsion is also found\u00a0in a game dubbed \"Getting Over It\".)\u00a0If your pickax happens to collide with any of your unfortunate brethren, they immediately perish.<br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/> Like any good friend, you wish to cause your bros harm. In order to do so, you must fight not only them, but your unwieldy pickax. Properly manipulated, your pickax may\u00a0propel you towards your bros... or your own\u00a0untimely death.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/665/6656fb7300ec44875d248d3d65ed1a0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DefecateRainbows"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
