Massively-multiplayer arm wrestling. I know, I know. We've all been waiting. And it's here.</p>\n<p>This game is built on HappyFunTimes -\u00a0The way this game works in this - you need 1 computer to run the game. Smart phones are the controllers. To connect a phone to the game, you just need to be on the same WIFI as the computer.</p>\n<p>Then go to happyfuntimes.net on your phone to play.</p>\n<p>Your phone will show you the team you're on with the color it turns (teams are chosen automatically). Theoretically, an infinite number of players can play, but more likely it'll be limited by your router to around 50 people. Still, that's a lot of arm power.</p>\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\n\n\n<p>You can see more here:\u00a0http://evokegames.com/holdinghands/</p>\n<p>Made originally as part of\u00a0#summerslowjams\u00a0in PDX.
