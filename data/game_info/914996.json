It's a comic about time, and coming back to something different than what you left behind.</p>\n<p>I've decided to slowly re-release older works that have otherwise disappeared from the internet, and present them alongside my own thoughts and reflections. Nuclear is the first re-release! \r\n</p>\n<p>The comic is 11 pages, and this archive edition includes an author's note and 2 pages of developmental extras/insights. It is free/pay-what-you-want, and I deeply appreciate any generosity you want to throw my way!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T05:49:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3439a05029bf3af17bedcc248eaaed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OliveOilCorp"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
