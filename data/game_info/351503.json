{"id": 351503, "slug": "juda", "name": "JUDA", "name_original": "JUDA", "description": "Juda is an adventure game currently in development by a one-man \"team\" called Reky Studios. Although I am in the early stages of development I have meticulously planned out every feature and mechanic to avoid feature creep and to set an ambitious but realistic scope. The completed game will have an emphasis on discovery, environmental story-telling, puzzles, combat, and more! Look below to see some of the game's highlights (keeping in mind that there is still much to be done!)<h3>Beautiful Environments</h3><br/>Handcrafted environments to make the world look beautiful and feel alive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Awesome Powerups / Unique Abilities</h3><br/>Juda is special. Unlike most winged creatures, he can use his wings for... well just about everything! Every level grants Juda more unique abilities and awesome ways to use his versatile wings.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:44:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20e/20e21d896dc9765301cc2406b66a2d98.jpg", "website": "http://rekystudios.com/juda.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Reky Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Reky Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
