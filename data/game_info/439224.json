Controls are A and D for left and right and W and Space to jump. I hope you enjoy it, you definitely won't get hours of game play out of it but for a few seconds it should be enjoyable.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Please Play in 1080p sorry I didn't have time to sort scaling with camera.</strong></p>\n<p>Music -\u00a0SOUND AIRYLUVS by ISAo https://airyluvs.com/</p>\n<p>Dog Barking -\u00a0dog bark sound http://soundbible.com/523-Dog-Growling.html</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T04:30:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/7830e1cc325b45acf4acef5b8a600e7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["hughjph"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
