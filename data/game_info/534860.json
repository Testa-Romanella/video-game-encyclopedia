Click a defender from the bottom area and then click the board where you want to place it. Trophies will not defend, but instead make extra points for you. I made this game for the 2020 Secret Santa Game Jam and I hope they like it!</p>\n<p>Most art made by me except for the menu image.\u00a0Main song written by me but sound effects downloaded from a free-use database.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Sorry it starts on the Options Menu, meant to have it start on a splash screen.\u00a0I think you also have to exit the option menu and then go back into it for the music to play, so sorry for that. But yeah.
