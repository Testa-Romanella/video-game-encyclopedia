Your goal is to connect all the dots. Sounds familiar? Nothing could be further from the truth. Splashy Dots has one of its kind mechanics that can't be found in any other game. If you like games such as chess, Sudoku, Go or Rubik's cube you will be amazed by how much this game has to offer beyond the colorful art style.<br/><br/>You move the dot with swipes so in order to play this game you need a single hand and an open-minded brain. Your dot moves on a visually appealing grid that lets you easily understand the in-game physics. You can move horizontally or vertically within this grid. There are only splashes and paint streaks. Whenever you swipe you create both - a streak and a splash. The in-game music is relaxing and your moves are accompanied by calming sound effects.<br/><br/>At the beginning the game is easy, but it gets more brain-challenging with each level you complete. It's easy to finish initial levels which contain only a few dots but you need to learn how to test your strategies in order to finish levels with a dozen of them. You need your combined experiences to progress in the game. There's always at least a single possible solution but usually, the first move is the most important one. It can immediately help you solve the puzzle or break the odds of winning. <br/><br/>The world of Splashy Dots is full of colors. Gameplay will make you excited. It's addictive and challenging. Whenever you get stuck you don't need to stop - there's a hint that you may want to use. There's no such thing as a score so you don\u2019t need to hurry. Take your time, be patient. Test your skills and try to solve one of the most creative modern puzzlers. <br/><br/>If you own AppleTV you need to know that the Splashy Dots TV version was not only specially designed for TV, but the game will be synchronized across all your devices, whether it's iPod, iPhone or AppleTV.
