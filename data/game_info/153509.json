Known as The Great Purge, the event wiped all the robots\u2019 memory and destroyed the social circuit of many lower-spec previous generation robots, sending them haywire and hostile to any unaffected robot. At the discovery of a second impending Great Purge, LEAF is activated by Sproink -\u00a0 the last robot not taken away by the haywire bots - to fight his way to the old Robot Factory and activate the planetary Laser Shield Array that was constructed long ago for protecting the previous civilization\u2019s electronic components and prevent certain catastrophe...\r\n<p><strong>Ending</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Just as the next burst of solar radiation is about to reach the atmosphere, LEAF activates the Laser Shield Array and a field of energy quickly envelops game world. The second Great Purge is averted and the robot inhabitants of the world retain their memories and their repaired social circuit remains intact.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LEAF</strong> - The player character; LEAF (Logically Engineered Artificial Fighter) is a prototype of the final robot model ever developed by the old civilization that mysteriously disappeared before they were ever able to roll out production model LEAFs off the assembly line.LEAF was deactivated at the time of the first Great Purge and carries the backup images that have the possibility of fixing the feral robots\u2019 Social Scripting and return the robot world to the order it enjoyed before the Great Purge, long ago. LEAF possesses superb athletic ability and is compatible with multiple weapons and interfaces - the perfect machine to complete the daunting task of making it to the old Robot Factory and reactivated the Laser Shield Array.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sproink</strong> - The last inhabitant of the Robot Village and the one who activated LEAF, Sproink is a greedy opportunist with a penchant for low-brow humor. While he is an unsavory character seeking to save himself and still exploit the situation by offering equipment to LEAF for sale, he genuinely wants to repair all the robot models and protect their civilization, albeit just so he can make a fortune peddling them shoddy wares.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why was this game made?</strong></p>\n<p>We are UCF Students that were tasked to make a video game in 13 weeks. We started with an idea and determination. We did hit some bumps in the road but we ultimately think that the turnout was great. Overall it was a learning experience. LEAF isn't a first for many of us as we are in our months at UCF and we used this game as a showcase of our skills as well as our imagination. It is of course not the perfect game but our hearts put into the game.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team   Member</strong>\n</p> <p><strong>Role</strong>\n</p> <p>Chris Encarnacion\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>Animator, 3D Artist\r\n   \r\n  </p> <p>Ryan Ferguson\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>Producer, Programmer\r\n   \r\n  </p> <p>Jacob Galante\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>Design Lead, Programmer\r\n   \r\n  </p> <p>Ross Hartman\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>3D Artist\r\n   \r\n  </p> <p>Luis Mata\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>3D Artist\r\n   \r\n  </p> <p>Matthew Schaffter\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>Art Lead, Creative Director</p> <p>Ian Valle\r\n   \r\n   </p> <p>Lead Programmer\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5c4a1b496bad60bc3d3a80faa66b341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Luis_Mata", "BTMS09", "Nannerpuss", "rihart"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
