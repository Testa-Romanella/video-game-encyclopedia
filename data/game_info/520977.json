The layout is a rough by-eyeball\u00a0design with no score or ruleset\u00a0and everything could use more tuning, but the game flips and you can challenge yourself to try to clear all the drop targets in one ball(I still haven't done it).</p>\n<p>I have plans to return to this in the coming year, test more complex layouts and\u00a0flesh it out further, with the goal being to make a well-rounded study of pinball that could serve as an introduction for new players, with scenarios to practice various techniques, a variety of game modes, and a little bit of character-driven content.</p>\n<p>Let me know in the comments if you have thoughts or ideas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:06:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba3/ba350edef22ad4976554810916a997d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["triplefox"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
