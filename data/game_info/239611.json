You can build new dice choosing shape (from 4-sided to 30-sided), color, and specific numeric values for each side.<br/>Dice can be grouped as you like, allowing you to keep different sets available, specific for each game.<br/>Dice throwing is simulated on a virtual table, with a simple, effective 3D visualization; you can throw them moving the device as you're accustomed with real dice. Then all you have to do is wait until they stop rolling... and cross your fingers!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:15:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a6/1a63f35687841f03df36d58c0f12a8cc.jpg", "website": "http://www.bonamsoft.com/dicer.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["Marco Bonasoro"], "esrb_rating": null}
