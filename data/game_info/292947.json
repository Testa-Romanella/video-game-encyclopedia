{"id": 292947, "slug": "soko-loco-deluxe", "name": "Soko Loco Deluxe", "name_original": "Soko Loco Deluxe", "description": "Soko Loco is a transport strategy game.<br/><br/>Collect wood, stone and steel to expand your empire, feed towns to grow population and streamline your production process to build a giant monument! The more efficient your systems, the faster your world can grow. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the game, you'll build tracks, drag trains, build lumber camps, assign workers and make train schedules. Building infrastructure costs resources and cities need bread to produce workers - a careful allocation of income and strategic thinking will be needed to complete your goals!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><ul><li>Campaign of 4 levels<br/></li><li>4 additional challenge levels<br/></li><li>Randomly generated terrain<br/></li><li>Custom map/scenario editor<br/></li><li>Cities and population growth<br/></li><li>Tunnels, bridges, gates and signals<br/></li><li>8 types of cargo<br/></li><li>Record timers and high-scores</li></ul><br/>After the campaign, you'll unlock challenge mode, which provides 4 real tests of trackbuilding to the more seasoned players. However, because the maps are randomly generated, there's a lot of replay value in trying to best your score on the final level, or trying different playstyles to complete all the achievements. For more laid-back people, there's the level editor, which lets you make your own maps and scenarios - create some real challenge for yourself or your friends, and build anything you like!<br/><br/>Soko Loco is for veteran train sim fans and newcomers alike, putting the best of train simulators in a relatively easy-to-understand game, while managing 4 types of resources means more challenge than most traditional simulators have to offer.
