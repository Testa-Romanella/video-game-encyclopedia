It's a simple block dropping puzzle game where the worms then turn the dropped blocks into worm compost. When the bulldozer comes along to ship lines of worm compost away you score points. Very basic and not as featured as I would have liked but happy I got something submitted at least for my first game jam!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18e/18ee5bad265ab7f022b94a895e9e8825.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lyndoh"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
