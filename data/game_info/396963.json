Someone did a heist in the very next millisecond, at 2.048791 unified solar time. Since then, the spacebank has been heisted over one billion times, regardless of the number of armed guards, bombs, trap mines, or missile launchers used to defend it. You are the latest heister, ready to make your space fortune, and it would be so embarassing if you were the first one to actually get caught.</p><p>Move with WASD or the arrow keys. Shoot with the left mouse button and drop bombs with the right mouse button, but don't escalate too quickly or the cops will show up. Dash away from their bullets with the space bar.</p>\n<p>Originally submitted as part of Ludum Dare 31.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-09T02:09:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dd/9dd411c6d260fea86ce2c990aa271555.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Boxed Meat Revolution"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
