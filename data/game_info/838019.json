A disabled bee must've forgot it there. Cricket picked it up and put it on, and started flying around. You warn Cricket to be careful because jetpacks are dangerous. Cricket ignores your warning, and continues flying around. Eventually, Cricket loses control, slams into Queen Bee, and crashes onto a cloud, destroying the jetpack. Queen Bee's subjects take it upon themselves to gain retribution, and attack Cricket. You now have to protect Cricket while he gets to safety.</p>\n\n<p>Controls: WASD / Arrow keys<br/></p>\n<p>Source: https://gitlab.com/tycha/wowie-game-jam-entry-2022<br/></p>\n\n<p>Henry Rovnyak - code, art, sound effects, level design</p>\n<p>Matthew Chen - code, level design</p>\n<p>Holly Rovnyak - story, title<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T18:48:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6b/a6b46ee160cdd21baf7a94206627e45a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Irionyme"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
