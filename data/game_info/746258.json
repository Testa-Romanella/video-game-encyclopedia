I didn't get to work on it the whole time, so I had to comprimise in the end. That said, I think it turned out alright :).</p>\n<p>The premise of the game is that you are inside a schizophrenic persons head, trying to stave off delusions from reaching your \"weak\" neurons and losing your mind. The theme plays in here with the delusions being imagined in the head of the schizophenic person. It is meant to be quite dark and spooky, with the scaling of the game intending to make it impossible to resist the delusions forever. Eventually, you will fail and they will reach the end and your mind will be lost.\u00a0It didnt quite come out this way, but none-the-less it's what I aimed for.</p>\n<p>The only control for this is left click to shoot towards your mouse.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T06:05:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95b/95b3c9e031a7a8ad9cb72561ecb4ecbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["prchristie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
