{"id": 135849, "slug": "sword-chaser", "name": "Sword Chaser", "name_original": "Sword Chaser", "description": "<p>Sword Chaser is a 2D side scrolling infinite runner where the player must run, jump, and slide past enemies to catch a magical sword that has flown off.\u00a0 This was a project meant to help the team members learn how to better use Unity and to gain experience. While the game was meant to be a quarter long project, the team made this game over the course of Fall and Winter quarters of 2017-2018.\u00a0 Artwork is original material, sounds and music are from royalty-free sources. There are more things the team would have liked to do given more time and there are bugs aplenty, but it was about time to move on to new projects. In any case, I'm proud of the team's work.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Team Lead, Writer - Riley Park</p>\n<p>Programmer - Darren Lim, Jonathan Almendarez, Blake Wakasa</p>\n<p>Audio Collection - Ariana Mertz</p>\n<p>Art Concepts - Sheridan Steele</p>\n<p>Artist - Kimberly Hsu, Cecilly Reagan, and Molina Mey</p>\n<p>Special Thanks to Ulises Perez, Wilfredo Paraiso,\u00a0 Kyle Kissler, and Kenneth Malubag</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14e/14eb5868cad03f0d0450bcf77db51a27.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dsaname"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
