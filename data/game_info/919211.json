Soon Tus realizes that the spaceship is abandoned and the remaining crew are dead. She doesn't know how long has passed since the initial day the spaceship was descending on Susa. The only certainties are that the spaceship has crashed on Susa, her home planet, and that there are robot-like cannons which roam around the spaceship. These cannons kill anyone approaching the spaceship from the surrounding hills, the only hills on Susa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meanwhile three unknown voices connect to Tus\u2019 communication device. Each voice is from a political force on Susa and tells a different tale about the fate of the spaceship, why it has crashed, and why there are cannons protecting it. Each voice asks help from Tus. Which voice is telling Tus the truth and which one should she help?\r\n</p>\n<p>By watching CCTV videos, reading memoirs, solving various puzzles, remembering conversations, and talking to the unknown voices, Tus should reconstruct the past and understand what has happened to the ship before she can make a conscious decision over the future of herself and her home planet.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game is made by:</p>\n<p>Babak Arzani, Matias Acuna, Krzysztof Leski, Kati Huuhilo, Boris Koste, Mariana Garcia, Tanja Heikkinen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T16:16:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6ab87bd986120285e5bd8efaeb5b9b58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Babak Arzani"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
