{"id": 251420, "slug": "dalis-pitfall", "name": "Dali's Pitfall", "name_original": "Dali's Pitfall", "description": "<p>A whole new throw onto an old classic game from the Atari 2600, \"Pitfall!\". Play through the new take of Pitfall! with inspiration by the renowned artist, Salvador Dali. But be quick, as you must battle against a 10 minute timer and must collect all 15 items before you can win!</p>\n\n\n<p>Come across strange new interpretations of the old enemies! Each enemy having their own behaviours, still using the same methods as the original, through a new view. There are three types of enemies you can encounter during your travels:</p>\n<ul><li>Looking Eyes</li><li>Criticism</li><li>Scissors</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Adventure across a procedurally generated world, made up of 48 world segments! Using 4 different types of platforms and a new game seed each time, you will never see the same world twice! Not only is the map generated, but the locations of items and enemies will also be generated. Some items may be easier than others, as some might be hovering between pits or within the underground of a segment with no ladders, so backtracking is important! Enemy are also generated, so they might be on the same path as you!</p>\n\n\n<p>Vanishing Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p>\n<p>DKlon<br/>https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-jumping-sounds</p>\n<p>timgormly<br/>https://freesound.org/people/timgormly/sounds/170147/</p>\n<p>outroelison<br/>https://freesound.org/people/outroelison/sounds/150950/</p>\n<p>StoryTella Font<br/>https://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Storytella.font</p>Controls<p>A/D\u00a0 and Left/Right Arrow\u00a0- Left and Right movement</p><p>W/Space/Up Arrow - Jump</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e2/2e24c19975b2615d929a5c17e7d6ec71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Caleb"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
