Players can beat buttons to generate a variety of terrain. Maps can randomly generate features like mountains and rivers. Different areas are also colored. There are four landforms to choose from (sand, dirt, snow, and grass). The player can control the camera to see the map in all directions. Hope to bring players perfect visual experience and enjoyment. The map is determined by the player's creativity. Hopefully, there will be more and better maps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T06:50:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b54/b548a69cde2d6e403bd9fe25eafe6862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AQiiiii"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
