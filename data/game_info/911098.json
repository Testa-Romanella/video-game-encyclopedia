So for 2023 I decided to tackle another Project from back then that also stemmed from the production on DVTNOTM and that was A Long Boring Journey To The Moon, This idea i originally Concived in 2008 and went back to in 2011 the idea was to create an ambient experimental film in real time of a spaceship traveling to the moon a journey approx 60 hours the idea was to create a 60 hour animated piece that would play continiously in an abandonned shop window on a CRT TV Screen back in 2011 I started the Project but never finished as other projects got in the way. Last year i had a crack at trying to turn it into an hour long piece as an experimental Art film but again other things got in the way for me to fully realise it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However when i saw it was FFS JAM time again i decided to go for it and this time rework it into a Game / Interactive Experience and now finally we have A LONG AND BORING JOURNEY TO THE MOON! This is an IDLE simulation of a journey through space to the moon, The Experience takes place over 60 hour long Segments At the end of each Hour you have the option to continue or quit and what will happen when you finally reach the moon?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Imagine Desert Bus but Longer and with Less to do\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>The experience has many hidden secrets and shortcuts and the game can be Speedrun and can be finished in well under 24 hours but discovering that path isn't going to be an exciting it will be a long boring adventure in itself just searching for the route haha.</p>\n<p>This is more a unique experiment rather than a full on Game and it's certainly not for everyone.</p>\n<p>But i am glad I have managed to create something unique and very experimental. I very much doubt anyone in the world is going to be prepared to have this running for 60 hours and checking on it each hour to advance but if your brave enough and have the endurance to get through GO FOR IT! :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T15:31:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7be/7be29aa0ad9308c7170e71d5a0c2f582.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 175, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lets go to the grindhouse"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
