Initially released in July 1992 for Japanese audiences, the game was later made available in North America the following September. The game centers on two friends, Timmy and Jamie, young children who are accidentally transported to a world resembling prehistoric Earth populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs. While a device which will allow them to return home exists in this environment, a critical component has been stolen by Mr. Big, leader of a gang of Neanderthals known as The Rockeys, leaving the player to guide Timmy or Jamie to his castle to retrieve it. They are assisted by Rex, a Tyrannosaurus, and Tops, a Protoceratops, each with their own play-styles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990d89e6de173aee307c3c903a3c3a26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Irem"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["IREM"], "esrb_rating": null}
