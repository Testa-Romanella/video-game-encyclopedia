{"id": 865907, "slug": "gold-collex-hex-defense", "name": "Gold Collex Hex Defense", "name_original": "Gold Collex Hex Defense", "description": "<p>Controls: Left click: Place tower, X: Destroy building, G: Place gold pile,\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tutorial: Press X to break the gold pile (orange square) under your mouse. Left click to place a tower. Drag some gold onto it to build it. Towers create gold around them every 10s. Use it to build more towers. The tiles around towers can only produce so much gold. So if multiple towers are mining the same hex, it won't produce every time.</p>\n<p>Boss: Feed it gold to win.</p>\n<p>Bugs: Each tower you place costs more than the last one. Destroying an unbuilt tower doesn't reduce this cost. So the first tower costs 5 gold, second costs 7, etc. You start with 6 gold. So if you click to make an unbuilt tower and then destroy it, you soft lock yourself with only 6 gold to try to build a tower that costs 7. Bug 2: You can click to build a tower on a tower that's already built. It'll just eat your gold to try to build another tower on top of the first. It doesn't shoot more or produce more.</p>\n<p>Made for Ludum Dare 51. Everything made by me. Used Bevy engine for the first time. Used\u00a0https://lospec.com/palette-list/bot16\u00a0(poorly) for the colours.</p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/GoldCollexHexDefense</p>\n<p>I had a heck of a time getting the game to be playable in browser on itch. I think it had something to do with absolute path vs relative path. itch wants \"./files\", rust building to wasm defaults to \"/files\".\u00a0I eventually got it to work using a github template so code moved here:\u00a0https://github.com/TyLanger/bevy_ci_template_ld51</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-14T11:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd6/fd6d7c6059d723eb32bdc7e83c778858.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Solrun"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
