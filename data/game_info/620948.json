How hard could it be? But wait you can only\u00a0move in one direction! That's where\u00a0the magnets come in, use them to join multiple blocks together and gain more control!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD - Move</li><li>Space - Grab</li><li>R - Reset</li><li>Escape - Return to menu</li></ul>\n\r\nMy thoughts\r\n<p>The art came out pretty good, its\u00a0intended to emulate the feel of a Gameboy game with 16x16 sprites and a 4 colour palette. I think these limitations really help to hide my lack of artistic talent.</p>\n<p>I love how splitting the levels into different worlds with different palettes and music tracks turned out. It really helped break the game up and stop the look getting boring. I tried to make worlds feel unique. World 1 is a tutorial to teach the main mechanics, World 2 is simple puzzles to give a good feel for how things move, World 3 then introduces immovable blocks to create more complex puzzles. Most of the game is quite easy but the last few levels start to become challenging, I think World 4 would have to have bigger levels to be able to keep the difficulty increasing. I also worry that there are only so many colour palettes I can use before things start looking ugly.</p><p>I probably spent to much time on the menu and level select screen for such a small game, not much point in saving your progress between sessions when there are so few levels. I had a lot of fun rendering the spinning cube though.<br/></p><p>I think the main failing is the lack of level variety\u00a0but it turned to be extremely difficult to come up with unique ideas. I think this could be solved with larger levels of varying shapes but that would mean zooming the camera out and then the pixel size wouldn't be consistent\u00a0so I feel it might compromise the style but I'm yet to experiment with it.</p>\n<p>I tried creating my own music but after a couple of hours I hadn't made much progress so I ended up borrowing some tracks\u00a0from\u00a0Pix. Sound effects are generic sfxr which work but are pretty boring.</p>\n<p>Overall I'm quite happy with how this turned out.<br/></p>\n\n<p><em>(Title is meant to be like monstrosity but with boxes)</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T20:52:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19a30c47169d87b68ee358e4dbf13da1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HintOfLime"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
