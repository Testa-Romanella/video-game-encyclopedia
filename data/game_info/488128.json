Mr.Hunnicutt shared his home made pie in his middle school math class. Little did the students know they would become the carriers of the terrible virus PI-20 reducing them anyone who has ever suffered due to math into walking zombies. Fight back the waves with the zombie's only weakness, math. After all, the corgi is good RNG.<br/><br/>Made for the PIGSquad#summerslowjams<br/><br/>This game\u00a0is meant to be played while streamed. The game is downloaded by a host while players connect via number-horde-client. Be warned, difficulty scales with players!<br/><br/>Huge thank you to all those who helped, my DMs who let us skip role play sessions to get this done, and the PIGSquad team.<br/><br/>Also, it's probably bug ridden. Probably.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T03:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/823/823656bd07792c76218bf06bede98cec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tri-Wight Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
