{"id": 95217, "slug": "the-cremation-of-sam-mcgee", "name": "The Cremation of Sam McGee", "name_original": "The Cremation of Sam McGee", "description": "<p>This project is based on the poem 'The Cremation of Sam McGee' by Robert W. Service (1907). The art style is heavily derived from the work of Ted Harrison, and his collection of paintings which share the poem's namesake. The narration is derived from a reading by Johnny Cash on the NPR from 2006 (while the delivery has some errors, it's by far my favourite reading of the text).</p><p>This is not a game, but rather a narrative experience to engage with one of my favourite pieces of poetry. It only takes a few minutes to finish, perhaps only a couple more than listening to a reading of the source text. It was proudly developed in the Unreal 4 Engine, and primarily features assets collected from Epic Game's various package releases. All audio is retooled from freesound.org, and the music track is an altered version of KatMaestro and dem0lecule's 'Frozen River' from NewGrounds.</p><p>This project can be used freely for educational purposes, but cannot be redistributed for profit in any way.</p>Controls:<br/>Movement - WASD/Joystick<br/>Interact - E/Left Face Button<br/>Pause - ESC/StartThanks for playing!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/893/8938464f49a53d4a16d62e5ba45eb590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["NickJennings"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
