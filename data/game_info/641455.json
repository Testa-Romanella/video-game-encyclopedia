He can only move vertically and horizontally and he is not very good at stopping.</p>\n<p>When you complete a new level you will earn Character Token points, when you have completed enough levels you will be rewarded with a Character Token that you can use to unlock a new character.</p>\n<p>The WebGL version is a demo with a limited amount of level and no saving, if you want more levels and saving try out the full version on Google Play.</p>\n<p>The game is currently under development, so expect bugs and progress will be reset from time to time. If you have any feedback feel free to contact me at \u00a0feedback@skm-games.no or post it here on itch.io.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:35:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d70/d70c7f5ba3586abf1aa3be5a9cbb62d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sKm"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
