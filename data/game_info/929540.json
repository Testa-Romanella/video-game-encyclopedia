I made it as a part of Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1. However, I only could work on it for 2 days out of the 7.\u00a0Overall I'm happy with the results but\u00a0I feel like it could be more polished. The UI is spaced weirdly because it went weird when I built the version but I didn't have the time to fix it.</p>\n<p>The rules of the game are simple. The end of a word is the start of the next but you can't have repeating words. The aim is to get the highest score possible, enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T10:56:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea3f2953e35d30a7810a5f4f010a9569.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AdHam2899"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
