The main improvement is that you can play it this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick Start:</strong> You have 2 currencies, Research and Money. Both are gained at the end of each month based on how many and what types of sheep you have. Click the research icon in the top left to open the research window, where you can unlock new sheep to buy in the shop. (You can hold SHIFT and click to invest 50 research, instead of clicking the button 50 times!) Click the shop icon in the top right to open the shop. There, you can scroll through the available sheep, and purchase anything you have enough money for.\u00a0Time only progresses while you're on the main screen, so there's no use in AFKing in the shop or research!</p>\n<p><strong>There is only one save game slot. You'll have to copy the file to back up your save, and creating a new game and letting the game autosave will overwrite any save you already have!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>A Bit More:</strong> Left click on the main screen to pick a sheep up. This will let you move it around, hold it, drop it, and sell it. How do you sell? Either press SPACE while holding the sheep, or drop it off the edge of the Sheep Containment Island. A bit of money will be refunded by the sheep gods. Most of the assets were drawn by myself, but all artists of the ICR Corporation are listed below. If you'd like to load a save, reload the the webpage and click the \"Load\" icon on the main menu. You can toggle sound by pressing <strong>M</strong> and toggle autosaving by pressing <strong>S</strong>. The web version looks like doodoo buttcrack but I assure you the fonts are not messed up on the downloadable .zip file.<br/></p>\n<ul><li>\"crobis is rad\" - Glow Sheep</li><li>\"PowerOut14; master of the trade\" - Lazor [sic] Sheep</li><li>Iggs - Pan Pride Sheep</li><li>romenski - Baazrrt Sheep</li><li>BenG/Jharlembusck Jr - Cute Sheep</li></ul>\n<p>Extra special thanks to okohe, who helped me with many things I didn't draw myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T06:02:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6f/d6f62755af845a847696fea7ba4e169e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["shipdit"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
