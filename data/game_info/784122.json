The app offers the museums a shared Augmented Reality Space to advertise and playfully interact with people outside of its walls. It uses position tracking and plane detection to display 3D content directly in your smartphone camera's field of view. <br/></p>\n<p>Ideally the users could turn into curators of the themselves, playing with the Museum's precious pieces that are normally unreachable, invisible, untouchable.<br/></p>\n<p>- DISPLACE takes the objects out of the museums for all to see, makes them inhabit unusual contexts to create brand new meanings. The museum forgets its walls for a while, and its precious content moves to inhabit the city instead.<br/></p>\n<p>- It invites people inside by teasing them with cool pieces to see, exciting experiences to live inside. The museum takes this extra-step towards its future users!<br/></p>\n<p>- DISPLACE cancels the distance separating you from museums from other cities.\u00a0It allows to showcase the news of the museums partners and be perceived as a united and interconnected institutional network. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>TEAM #3 - Alan, Annika, Fehime &amp; Fred Urien<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T09:13:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/226c2cc2e68599e3f667e83e3c2c90b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Fehime7"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
