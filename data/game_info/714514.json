{"id": 714514, "slug": "fear-therapy", "name": "Fear Therapy", "name_original": "Fear Therapy", "description": ":<br/>Fear Therapy is a theory that has long been researched by psychologists. The lack of sufficient data makes it difficult to prove this theory. Many people have done real-time experiments to prove this theory before, but they were too scared to complete the experiment and interrupted it. <br/><br/>The main subject of this theory is that, people start not to be afraid of the fear factors they encounter for the first time after a while.The result of most of the experimental studies is that,the subjects overcome the fear they are exposed to. But after a while this fear starts again. Subjects who are constantly exposed to this fear become numb. As another result of the study, subjects exposed to fear start out more courageously when exposed to fear again.
