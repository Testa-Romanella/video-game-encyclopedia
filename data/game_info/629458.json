{"id": 629458, "slug": "street-cat-king", "name": "Street Cat King", "name_original": "Street Cat King", "description": "<p>Play as an adorable cat and meow at everyone you come across to get their attention! Click around the screen to have the cat move around, and click on the 'meow' button to meow at people until they give you attention. Your life bar will deplete over time, but certain people give treats that restore your energy.\u00a0You can also wait for your owner to come back and have them pet you to restore some energy. If you get the attention from certain people enough times, they might give you a gift that will power up the cat the next time you play!</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this is a demo build for my very first game. I hope you enjoy this little game, and please stay tuned for other games in development. If there is a lot of interest in this, I might come back to this and develop some game concepts that didn't make it into the demo build and make it a full-fledged game with more power-ups and a storyline involving all of the people you see in the game and of the people who didn't make it into this build.</p>\n\n\n<p>I did most of the work on my own with the help of my mum who did all the environmental props.
