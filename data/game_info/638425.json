With no hope of survival, you seek the only light in the cave, waiting for help while you do.</p>\n\n<p>Light the way is an omega short platformer made in a week made by me, who had a week experience prior in only 3D, not 2D. That's why it's so bad and laggy. I'll fix it, but it'll take some time.\u00a0 This game is made for the Indies Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Controls: A for left ,\u00a0D for right, and Space for jump.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Made by: FuriouslyFury</p>\n<p>Testing: AuraFrenzy (My sister)</p>\n<p>Music: Fred Patry/TwistwonkaE</p>\n<p>Tutorial used for mechanics: Coding In Flow</p>\n<p>Inspiration: Find The Light by Voidz</p>\n<p>Made for the Indies Game Jam.</p>\n<p>Also I'm sorry that the zip extraction takes a long time. I left a lot of unused assets in Unity and when I remove them, my whole project goes crazy, so I kinda need some help on that. Won't work on the game till the 27th of July because I'm going on a trip. Hope you like the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T07:16:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20c/20c527316566e680f7ec9dd318ff85d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FuriouslyFury"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
