If you are ahead, stand in place.\r\n</p>\n<p>*The goal is to reach the end before your opponent does. If you reach the last spot at the same time, it is drawn, but if one had more steps after that spot, that would be the winner.\r\n</p>\n<p>You need to analyze the allocation of your opponent's dice and make a plan against what would be the actions that go on with that dice. So you simply try to neutralize the possible advantage of the opponent by giving a suitable allocation of chances to every action of your dice.\r\n</p>\n<p>Well Done.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T12:29:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ff/2fffdab4d8ae091b36f07611c62e09c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["m.daneshyab"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
