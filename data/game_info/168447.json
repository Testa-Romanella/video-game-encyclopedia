Daily competitions about trains saved and lost are a very normal thing, and so is losing touch of the reality of the job. If their accidents exceed a certain amount, they will certainly get fired. Help them do their job, by rotating the track platforms on the right time, and leading the trains to their goals.<br />\nThis is the 3rd game made by Team Awesome, a team of two Game Designers from Finland.
