The\u00a0outcome of each room is different,\u00a0see\u00a0#Station\u00a0Algorithms\u00a0for\u00a0more information. Press the button, which will change the game state appropriately.\u00a0After using a room,\u00a0that\u00a0room and\u00a0the crew\u00a0inside\u00a0cannot be interacted with for the rest of the turn.</p><p>Once the turn is complete, apply food consumption, and then all rooms and crew are enabled.</p><p><strong>Food Consumption</strong>: Crew members consume 0.5 food each, rounded up. If food goes below this amount, a 1d6 is rolled. If this number is less than or equal to the food deficit. one random crewmember will die.<br/> </p>\r\nStation Algorithms \r\n Hydroponics \r\n<p> Rounding Down: (Sum of Rolls / 2). Crew will consume 0.5 food each per turn, rounding up. If there is not enough food, there is a chance that one random crew-member will die. <br/></p>\r\nRollOutcome1+0 Food<br/>2 -3<br/>+1 Food<br/>4-5+2 Food<br/>6-7+3 Food<br/>8-9+4 Food10 -11<br/>+5 Food12-13+6 Food14+7 Food\r\nBio-Scan\r\n<p>Requires a 6+ roll to progress.
