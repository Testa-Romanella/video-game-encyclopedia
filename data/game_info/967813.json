Shakabula *", "description": "Be prepared to take on a terrifying South African legend, in this eerie experimental, horror shooter/exploration/rpg experience. Concocting an amalgamation of FMVs, 2D Art, South African folklore, Metroidvania, JPRG, \"Steer\" 'n Click and Twin-Stick Bullet Hell to create a rare hybrid game that gives the player a memorable action rpg horror experience they won't find anywhere else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Shakabula is a mysterious South Affrican Urban Legend that has taken many forms and is usually used as a character parents used to scare there kids if they were misbehaving. However, it seems that it is real and that not all is well with it, the current state of the world and it's memory of existence fading away it has become confused and corrupted over time, now it seems to be targeting you and it has trapped inside some kind of spirit realm and you can't seem to leave the confines of your house. But you're an adult, not a misbehaving child, why would it be targeting you? Could it perhaps be connected to the guilt and anguish you feel for you past transgressions and terrible decisions. Either way, you will need to find a way out of this situation, otherwise, your soul will wither away and your spirit will be cursed to wander for eternity.<br/><br/>Blending together FMV (Full Motion Video) sequences with 2D Art, ! Shakabula * brings together a unique mix of aesthetics to create a creepy atmosphere and bring to life the players inner demons that will challenge you across your journey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>! Shakabula * is heavily inspired by old school FMV Point-and-Click Adventure games in terms of it's presentation, navigation and item collection, but with a twist, taking more of a \"Active-Input\" / \"Animating Movement\" approach to the formula, I call it \"Steer\" 'n Click. <br/><br/>In terms of the game and world progression ! Shakabula * takes a strong Metroidvania approach rewarding the player with keys and abilities throughout the game that open up pathways in previous areas, requiring the player to backtrack in engaging ways in order to open up the entire map and make it to the end. With each playthrough having randomized placement of items and incorporating non-linear progression design, there is more than enough reason to replay ! Shakabula \u00ac multiple times to receive a different experience each time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The combat also takes a novel approach by combining Turn-based 90s JRPGs for combat management and choices, with light QTEs for raising the risk/reward of conflicts, and intense Twin-Stick Bullet Hell sequences to act as satisfying expressions of the battle between you and your inner demons. <br/><br/>With over 80 different enemies, 7 different enemy types, 5 Power-Ups to collect, multiple different battle arena layouts that get tougher as you progress, ! Shakabula * provides the player with a combat system that feels novel, diverse and engaging.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Get ready to be taken on a mysterious, creepy and strange little quest.
