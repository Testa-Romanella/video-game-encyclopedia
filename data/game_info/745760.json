The goal is to get into buildings, find coins to to open the door for the item you need and buy powerups.Finaly you have to escape with the  , you have found in the main building,  in short time. You can find items like keys , coins and soda which will help you beat the game faster and easier. You will always have a short description of the task to do next if you dont know what to do.
