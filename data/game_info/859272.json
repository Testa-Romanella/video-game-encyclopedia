I have been looking around in forums and other places to figure out what's wrong but I can't seem to figure it out. The worst part is that just before creating the builds for each platform, it worked perfectly in Unity, sounds and all, also I tried to create again the build in my backup but it seems it corrupted the back-up files again. I followed every single step on the course but for some reason just when I was about to submit it here, the audio broke. If I manage to fix it I will reupload another version.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your understanding</p>\n\n<p>Credits:<br/></p>\n<p>Created by Jaime D\u00edez-Hochleitner Su\u00e1rez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T17:49:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/612/6124ac40d42922e9a0949cc0b8ad71b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Screexter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
