It's also about the memories and relationships we attach to those games.\u00a0 Moreover, this is a game about\u00a0 how taking care of the things we cherish can remind us to take care of ourselves.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Created for the Extra Credits Game Jam 6:https://itch.io/jam/extra-credits-game-jam-6</p>\n<p>cw:grief, and brief mentions of alcoholism</p>\n\n<p>The story for the game comes from both my own coping with loss, as well as the story of a close friend. My roommate in college was happy to let me play his copy of \"Ocarina of Time,\" as long as a didn't delete a very special save file. Together, these experiences weaved together to create \"Blowing won't fix it.\" I hope you enjoy.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The music below was intended to be included in the game, but is here for your listening pleasure.\u00a0 The piece is \"No 6. In My Dreams\" by Esther Ambrami, and falls under creative commons for inclusion in creative works via its inclusion in the Youtube Audio Library.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T03:28:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb0/cb0d0c0ef8811fc9a59ce94ab9fcd33c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jakalofnight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
