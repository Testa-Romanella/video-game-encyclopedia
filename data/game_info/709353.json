And with the recent revolution in musical technology, the possibilites for sound are endless. Here you can play to your heart's content, get all the latest musical gear, and if you play your cards right then maybe make it to the top! Will you be the next shining star? And will you make millions? With the legendary rockstar, Lesley, to help guide you along nothing shall stand between you and stardom on the hard path of musical genius.</p>\n<p>Except maybe money problems.<br/></p>\n\r\nMY THOUGHTS<br/>\n<p>This was the first game I've really spent more than a week on, and I'm pleased with how it turned out for the time I put in! It's also one of the first more UI-based management games I've made, as well as the first card game, so it was a lot of new things. It was interesting stepping out of my comfort zone for this one, but the first step is always the hardest; I may be making more of these types of games soon! And I hope you like the character art too, since I sort of alternate between liking it and not - I think I've been looking at it too much to make an unbiased judgement.<br/></p>\n<p>Oh, and if my giftee is reading this, this one's for you!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T05:37:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3b/b3bf1c051a6380f83005011147057b16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 109, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cakestorm"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
