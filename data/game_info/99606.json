You are a new member of a shared house who is home alone. The game was made to question how far is too far when exploring someone else's personal space and to question a player's curiosity. Sometimes we want to learn things about others, but the things we learn about people can't be as easily unlearned. The house is filled with secrets about the other members, specifically your new housemate across the hall. How far will your curiosity take you?</em><em>\" -</em> Noah Seymour, Lead Designer</p>\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Shared House is a game that was created with the intention of conveying the lead designer's personal concept of home to the audience. It's not far fetched to say that everyone wants their own space, a place in which they can overcome their obstacles and confide in themselves. Are you capable of invading someone else's?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Designer and Creative Lead:</strong></p>\n<p>Noah Seymour</p>\n<p><strong>Project Manager:</strong></p>\n<p>Tylah Kapa</p>\n<p><strong>Programmer:</strong></p>\n<p>Joshua Irish-Donges</p>\n<p>Tom Lynn</p>\n<p>Tylah Kapa</p>\n<p><strong>Art and Animation:</strong></p>\n<p>Ben Revai</p>\n<p>Kelvin Tse</p>\n<p>Noah Seymour</p>\n<p>Teyden Pearl</p>\n<p> Toni-Louise Giacopelli<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong></p>\n<p>Blake Grosskreutz</p>\n\n<p><strong>This game was developed for SteamVR.</strong> <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>SteamVR Minimum Recommended Specifications:</strong></p>\n<p>OS: Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10 </p>\n<p>Processor: Intel\u00ae i5-4590 / AMD FX 8350 equivalent or greater </p>\n<p>Memory: 4 GB RAM </p>\n<p>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce\u00ae GTX 970 / AMD Radeon\u2122 R9 290 equivalent or greater</p>\n<p>Storage space: <em>Shared Home itself will require </em><strong>45</strong><strong>MB </strong><em>of storage space, however, SteamVR will require more</em><em>.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0fd/0fd4db2da259ea75b3184eb55a05707a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NoahlSeymour", "Shared-House-Game", "Kapa", "Tom Lynn", "Joshua Irish-Donges"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
