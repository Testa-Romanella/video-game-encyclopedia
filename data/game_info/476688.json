This one surprisingly wasnt made for a game jam. I made it cuz why not. In order to get inspiration to make this game i used\u00a0 a random game idea generator(this one:) and i got the idea \"Gravity-based bonsai game\" so thats what i made. The more score you rack up the more your Gravitree will grow! Towards the end of the score prizes youll find some references to my other 2 games, For Now, and MixumUp. Having fun reaching the max of 300 points(so far(more score prizes may be added in the future))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:37:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffc/ffc536be78a029769cbdc3b03519db2f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Habetis Invalidum"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
