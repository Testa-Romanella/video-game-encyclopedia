The goal is to mine as much gold as possible while staying alive and dodging incoming rocks. It gets more difficult the longer you survive and you can mine silver to reduce the difficulty.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD</li><li>Jump: Space bar</li><li>Mine: Left mouse button</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>There is an\u00a0<strong>in-game tutoria</strong><strong>l</strong>, but if it is not enough, here is a full one.\u00a0Your goal is to mine as much gold as possible, if you get more than 6, you will be able to advance to the next level. To reduce the difficulty you should mine silver and the difficulty indicator in the bottom right shows you the current difficulty level. A level can be exited by getting back to the spawn point and walking a bit further.\u00a0 If you cannot find the exit, look for wooden signs with arrows on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or just want to give me some honest feedback be sure to leave a comment, I'd love to hear your opinion!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>\n<p>https://github.com/DavidNawloka/CaveIn<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:53:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e30cc210fef6e37c2867d673d99221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Astutos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
