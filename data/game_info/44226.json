There are a number of different puzzle mechanics that will be explored throughout the game: <br/><br/><ul><li>Primary single colors <br/></li><li>Secondary additive colors <br/></li><li>Primary colors through subtraction <br/></li><li>Grey areas that you must avoid <br/></li><li>Switches that change elements in the level <br/></li><li>The combination of all colors to produce white <br/></li><li>Blank areas that can save a color to re-use later on <br/></li><li>Dual snake control<br/></li><li>And more...</li></ul><br/>The game follows the basic idea that light is made up of waves. This light can be interpreted as different colors depending on how long the waves are. There are three primary colors that come from this: <strong>Red</strong>, <strong>Green </strong>and <strong>Blue</strong>. These primary colors can then be added together to create secondary colors: <strong>Yellow</strong>, <strong>Cyan </strong>and <strong>Magenta</strong>. These six colors can then be mixed and separated to make each other, thus creating the complex puzzle mechanic that the game is built around.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Trailer music by Qrion</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a7/2a77f95ef56cca8ee05db730595800e6.jpg", "website": "http://www.dualstudios.co.uk/color", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Dual Studios", "Sam McGarry"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dual Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
