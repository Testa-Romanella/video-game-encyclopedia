Choose your country and let the whole world be subjected under your feet!<br/><br/><br/>Choose a country you want to play and conquer other countries.<br/><br/>Collect units and resources. Level up them using the resources.<br/><br/>Remember the countries you occupied. Other then you can't protect them from attacks and revolts.<br/><br/><br/>Each country has their own unit or a resource. Maybe you can choose just your homeland or the most favorite one. Or you can choose the country that looks like the strongest one.<br/><br/>Each unit has a class, status, and a preference for geographical features. Change the order of your troop as the strongest against your enemy.<br/><br/>Even you occupied a country, an enemy can attack it and take it from you. Or even they can revolt to you and get independent from you. There is only one way to stop the revolt is to remember their name and location and subdue them before the revolt is done.<br/><br/><br/>I hope, let there be peace on the earth under your merciful rule. Thank you.</p>\n<p>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Phortion.WorldMapConqueror&amp;fbclid=IwAR1_I7DXftU8D6nFl8Ktouf6EOmcoIPwxz7Bwrs3oIkJgVjluzmW2jDlu6I<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T02:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95c/95cc47481877a81ff8e022fc153bac0a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phortion"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
