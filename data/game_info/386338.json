Now all is lost and mankind has taken to live in space. All has been lost for ages for the planet and not a single soul has resided there since then. Today an exploration party has been sent to see what is left of the planet and determine if we can live there again. You are a young marine and have been chosen to go there to see what is up with the world. Fight whatever new horrors have spawn from these ages of polluted wasteland and see if we can find a place that is viable. And if you fail that's ok, we'll just send someone else a little later. After all, you are disposable.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>Hold tap to move\u00a0</li><li>STOP to shoot</li><li>Reach the bunker without dying</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:38:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a8f/a8f2f04f5cec611a5898dde47c1ea408.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Remyjacobi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
