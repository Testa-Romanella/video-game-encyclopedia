Play as <strong>Savior</strong>, a woman with a thirst for guilty blood. In a <strong>unique narrative</strong> described through contemplation and flashbacks, <strong>use your intellect</strong> to notice contradictions. Everyone's either lying, or not saying the whole truth. Get the details right, and you'll <strong>discover the mystery to a young boy's death</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is my first game, and it was all made within 5 days... and nights without sleep. For a total of 11 endings, you have to be keen and open-minded to reach an end that reflects your morals. Make sure to get your clues right, because you need at least 3 in order to get the true 7 endings. The music was also made by me, but you may get that impression quickly.</p>\n<p>#IGMC2017</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aae/aaec8229dc49df7a31ee0ee9877f5167.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RAMADORG"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
