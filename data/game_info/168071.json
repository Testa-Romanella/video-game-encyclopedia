The piece of art is essentially a tent with panes of art detailing an aspect of life. When observing each pane, it becomes apparent that the work is about the Circle of\u00a0Life and Nilima Sheikh's take on the Afterlife - <em>This is what I have tried capturing, the different stages of life.</em></p>\n<p>The aim of The Circle of Life is to walk from one end of the world to the other, while watching the different stages of life and the tones that come with it - <em>and then experience it all over again.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO PLAY</strong></p>\n<p>ESCAPE - Pause and Credits</p>\n<p>WASD / ARROW KEYS - Move around</p>\n<p>LEFT SHIFT - Stop moving the player.
