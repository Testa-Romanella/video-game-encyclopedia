Do they get to stay together in the end?</p>\r\nArtist Statement:\r\n<p>\u201cAmongst the Daffodils\u201d is a short story I wrote a few years ago that tells the story of a young boy who goes through a traumatic event. My original prose story ends at the very end of that event. My goal in translating this story into an interactive one was to explore the different ways this story could have ended and the possible ways he could deal with (or doesn\u2019t deal with) the resulting trauma from this event. The story itself is meant to be mildly suspenseful with some shock factor moments, however, it won\u2019t be the most interactive experience so as to not draw too much attention away from the story.</p>\n<p>I used Twine to make this story into an interactive experience, which made it easy to map out the branches in the storyline. Using a game engine like this kept the text element as the central mode of interaction with this story since some of the imagery I used in the original iteration\u00a0is more powerful when the player uses their imagination. Twine also allowed me to make how the text is displayed more engaging than just being a block of text on the page.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGeneral Information\r\n<ul><li><strong>Engine/software used: </strong>Twine (Harlow)</li><li><strong>Controls:</strong> Mouse Click</li></ul>\n\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Harlow Manual:\u00a0https://twine2.neocities.org/#macro_text-style</li><li>Twine Cookbook:\u00a0https://twinery.org/cookbook/index.html</li><li>Tutorial Blogpost by Damen L Wakes: https://damonwakes.wordpress.com/2019/01/31/twine-for-beginners-styling-text/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T20:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/947b9e5300a060090154f5f4dfd87079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ciarenn Hollis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
