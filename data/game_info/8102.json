Buy fields, fences, a barn, tractor, pond, and a variety of animals.   Place them where you want to design your farm the way you like it.  Water the crops from your pond, or use a tractor to  plow all the fields at once.<br/><br/>When you&amp;#39;ve harvested enough vegetables that are in demand, head to the market where you&amp;#39;ll have to pack customer&amp;#39;s baskets with vegetables without letting them fall off the conveyor belt.  Fill adjacent baskets to chain them together and collect bonus multipliers to earn the most cash!<br/><br/>This extremely addicting combination of harvesting and selling will keep your fingers moving and brain entertained!<br/>It&amp;#39;s two games in one!<br/><br/>Best of all it&amp;#39;s under 10 megs so you can download it directly to your phone without a computer!

I don&amp;#39;t know what it is but this game really appeals to me. I&amp;#39;ve never wanted to be a farmer or anything, so it&amp;#39;s kind of strange that I enjoy a virtual farming game so much. For only $0.99, it&amp;#39;s hard to go wrong here.<br/><br/>This game surprised the hell outta me! I figure for the cost and the amount of peace the game seems to bring me, it&amp;#39;s totally worth the buck I paid for it. 5/5&amp;quot;<br/><br/>AppModo.com:<br/>&amp;quot;Pocket Farm is extremely addictive. I simply couldn\u2019t stop playing this game.  I would definitely recommend this game to all kids, both young and old.&amp;quot;<br/><br/>DEVELOPER NOTES<br/>For all the people giving low reviews because they didn&amp;#39;t read the instructions...   READ THIS:  The crops in demand are highlighted with a yellow box at the top of the screen.  Don&amp;#39;t grow crops for the market if they aren&amp;#39;t in demand or no baskets will appear and you will waste them.  <br/><br/>JOIN THE FAN COMMUNITY<br/>-On Facebook at www.facebook.com/RockingPocketGames<br/>-On Twitter at twitter.com/RockingPocket<br/><br/>MORE GAMES<br/>\u2028Doodle Fishing, Doodle Chopper, Puppet Jump, Puppet Sprint, Puppet Labyrinth, Super Soccer Kick 3D, Super Football Kick 3D, Pocket Farm, iFishing, iFishing Saltwater, Dark Raider, Dark Raider S, Blue Skies 3GS, Blue Skies, The Guy Game, The Girl Game", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:24:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bea/bea9159f456b3ab3bbeb3be08c74045e_YSOrmyL.jpg", "website": "http://www.RockingPocketGames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 253, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Rocking Pocket Games", "Chris Egerter", "Mason Macbeth"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Casual", "Family"], "publishers": ["Chris Egerter", "Mason Macbeth"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
