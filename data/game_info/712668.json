There are three boxes at the bottom of the screen and various figures fall on top of them. Your goal is to assign corresponding icons to the boxes so that the figures from above fall directly into these boxes. The difficulty of the game is that the pieces fall quickly and you need to keep track of all three boxes almost simultaneously. In case of multiple mismatches, the game will be over and you will have to start the game again.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T04:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6c/c6c3148b35dd9b785447dbe53751b0d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["QuickBobber"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["QuickBobber"], "esrb_rating": null}
