Game Jam\".</p><p>The game has been developed to be played by 2 players locally, which is what we suggest to maximise your experience\u00a0\u00a0though, by design, you cn also play it solo.</p><p>The main concept is that one player controls the main character which has to move left to right through the map\u00a0avoiding obstacles in order to reach the end of the level whilst the second player, using the mouse, helps player 1 by placing objects into the map, allowing player 1\u00a0to vault otherwise unsurpassable obstacles.</p><p>This game is in a VERY early stage, we apologise for the various inconveniences you may occur into and we hope you'll enjoy yourself with it! Thanks for playing &lt;3</p><p>Feedbacks are very much appreciated :)<br/></p><p>Developers:\u00a0Thomas Del Prete, Jacopo Fidacaro, Alexander Fischer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T02:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/329645ed43b43b3740833c8c715604a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MrPriest"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
