This time, not really inspired by anything (except cookie clicker)</p>\n<p>This game is in a very early development stage, so you might be surprised why I'm uploading this. The reason is because, why not? You shouldn't be refrained from playing a game at such an early stage. And since I'm probably not gonna be working on this much, I might as well upload updates quick and fast.</p>\r\nOkay, on with the actual description.\r\n<p>Thanks for reading this up until now! But anyways, this game is literally just a clicker. A boredom repellent (or maybe a boredom attractant). Yeah, I know. It's stupid. I don't know why I made this. It's so simple.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:41:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a15/a158dae492075162e863e6d6769183b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TrexMan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
