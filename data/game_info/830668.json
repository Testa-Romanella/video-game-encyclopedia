You and your closest friend Amikiana embark on a world saving mission to once again stop the Great Evil. Along the way you pick up some unexpected help from around the world to hopefully overturn the repeat of events and stop the Great Evil once and for all.</p>\n\n<p>I wish all other entries the best of luck.\u00a0 And hopefully, after the contest is over, I can continue the storyline and polish up all the scenes, characters and assets to bringing at least several hours of gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T10:50:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b8a3298d52fc77419fcb847448d96f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kouruu"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
