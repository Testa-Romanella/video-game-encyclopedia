The game sees the player endlessly\u00a0delivering passengers from different corners of the post apocalyptic dessert to the thunder dome, trying to avoid\u00a0enemies as, since the player can't fight back, the players main defence will be running. As much as I like this project I'll be the first to admit that\u00a0it's not my finest work. But that's okay, because it's only by making this slightly confusing, slightly buggy, not particularly pretty game, that I'll have a battle plan should I ever make Crazy Post Apocalyptic Taxi Driver 3.\u00a0</p><p>Almost all of the models where found on sketchfab but it was so long ago now that I've lost all of the links for them</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T07:38:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25b/25b8146532e529645301045c4b8acb31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["<ArthurCoffinBound>().Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
