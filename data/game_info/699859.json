One player is in charge of holding the mouse and directing it by hovering the pointer so that the character can move to avoid monsters. While the other players are in charge of typing the words above the monster's head that serves to kill it. The game will end if the monster touches the character.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T07:40:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/546/5461b0daf9bfb7b2a382349046ff5431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cat.
