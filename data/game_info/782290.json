Not only is it a fun entry point for new language learners, it will also provide a challenge for intermediate learners who want to improve the speed and accuracy of their comprehension. But be prepared for a challenge. Being immersed in a new language can be very overwhelming at first, but its also the fastest and most effective way to learn.<h3>\"Will playing this game make me fluent?\"</h3>Definitely *not* by itself. A well rounded approach to language learning requires exposure to a variety of resources. You should read books, watch movies, use language apps, attempt conversations, and yes.. play games!<h3>\"I'm an advanced learner. Should I buy this game?\"</h3>Well, we certainly think so! In truth, you wont get as much out of it as a beginner/intermediate. But with your support we could add more levels of difficulty to the game as well as create more games in the future for a range of experience levels.<h3>\"How many hours of gameplay are there?\"</h3>It's very difficult to say as everybody learns at a difference pace. If you are a beginner we predict you'll need at least 10 hours of in-game experience before you are able to complete it.<br/><br/>Linguist FPS is a rougelike style game and it is expected that you will die a lot (especially at first). As your language skills improve, it will gradually become easier to access weapons, armor and health. Your survival time will increase with repeated attempts.<br/><br/>In addition to a training zone, the main game takes place in one large city with several potential starting locations. The supply rooms are procedurally generated with random challenges and loot inside. So each time you respawn you'll be in a new location with different challenges and equipment to discover.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T04:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/917/917da49731016172312e77c51e638e81.jpg", "website": "https://www.rocketboygames.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 449, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rocket Boy Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rocket Boy Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
