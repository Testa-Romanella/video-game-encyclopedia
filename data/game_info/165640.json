Sometimes we're too focused on the wrong goals. Sometimes it's hard to talk about.\u00a0<br/><br/>I\u00a0decided to make a bitsy game because I had trouble finishing things this year. I\u00a0poured everything into professional goals which fizzled out in the end, and sacrificed my personal projects and personal intimacy in the process. I\u00a0felt lost, and all around me were the bits and pieces of things I\u00a0had started and left by the wayside. My first instinct was to gather them all up and keep going, but I was in a fog and the pieces fumbled from my grasp. I needed to finish something to remind myself that I could, so I knocked this out in two days at the coffee shop. I\u00a0had no idea what direction it was going when I started, but I\u00a0ended up processing a lot while making it, and that's what this game is about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's not perfect, and part of me wants to go back endlessly and make edits, but that wasn't the goal of this piece. It's finished. I hope you get something out of it :)</p><p>This started as Claire Morley's bitsy tutorial and quickly morphed into something else. I highly recommend it! It's made with so much love that it teaches more than just mechanics.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/095/095400d08d6565d83e13d906abd7a32d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BedWords"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
