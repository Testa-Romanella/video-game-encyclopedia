You will help him battle the League of Insulters and learn how to be a true Master of Insults, uncovering the mysteries of the infamous organisation on the way.</p>\n\r\nA NEW TYPE OF CARD BATTLE\r\n<p>As the\u00a0idea for\u00a0the game was\u00a0born in a kind of game-jam context, our primary goal was to\u00a0simplify the core mechanics of the genre while making sure that\u00a0skill and intuition remained\u00a0an integral\u00a0part of gameplay. That's how we came up with the <strong>EmoType System</strong>, which combines the logic from \"Rock, Paper &amp; Scissors\", the insult battles from \"Monkey Island\u2122\ufe0f\" and the interrogation mini-game from \"L.A. Noire\". You will have to use your senses to anticipate the enemy's plans, and with the help of hints that you'll find as the story goes on, you'll learn how to master all 5 EmoTypes and more than 60 hilarious insult cards!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADE WITH LOVE\r\n<p>We at HELLPONY Studio are extremely proud to present you with our very first release. Even though the project started only as a demo version, we wanted to keep pushing ourselves further and continue polishing the game. We decided to publish it as a short, highly replayable, funny little (free) game. We tried to put all of our knowledge and effort into it, which resulted in each one of us covering many different roles. That's why we also managed to include:</p>\n<ul><li>2D hand-drawn cartoony graphics</li><li>6 unique soundtracks</li><li>More than 50 sound effects</li><li>A tutorial (!)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nHELLPONY STUDIO\r\n<p>Our studio was formed as an educational project during the \"Learn Teamwork by Developing Video Games\" course from GameTeam.Dev: we decided to stay together and continue our path towards game development as a group. Emotional Damage is our very first release, and each one of us worked on different aspects of it:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Niccolo' Pagnacco</strong>  -  Production, Concept, Lead Writing, Coding, Sound Design, Game Design</li><li><strong>Yauheni Marushka</strong>  -  Project Management, Concept, Writing, Game Design</li><li><strong>Luca Csik\u00f3s</strong>  -  Lead Design, Concept Art, Characters &amp; Background, UI Design\u00a0</li><li><strong>Hugo Koukka</strong>  -  Design, Concept Art, Characters &amp; Background, UI Design</li><li><strong>Eimantas Kiseliovas  -</strong>  In-engine Development, Coding, Testing</li></ul>\r\nWe would love to receive your feedback! &lt;3\r\n\r\n<p>Once you've had a chance to play through Emotional Damage, we'll absolutely love it if you'll <strong>join us on our brand new </strong><strong>Discord server</strong>. Don't worry about not having much to say:\u00a0we'd be happy to hear any feedback, suggestions, or general thoughts on the game.
