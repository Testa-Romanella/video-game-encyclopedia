Your fleet has been deployed in a\u00a0supposed peaceful sector in the Canis Major galaxy. Up until now, your task was only to scout the area for resources. However, recent events have changed drastically the nature of your mission as an unknown species of cruel aliens have declared war against humans. You are now to stop them at any cost to prevent a fatal invasion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Space bravos is a mobile game portraying the special forces and its heroic task to protect earth from a fatal alien invasion. Following the basic parameters of a \u201cshoot them all\u201d game, the player is to navigate through multiple levels and waves of organized and lethal enemies. At the end of every successful mission you are to collect points to trade for enhancements for your battleship. From neutron bombs, laser blasts to even up to 3 \u201cShadow pilots\u201d who will aid you through your missions.\r\n  </p>\n<p>The main challenge in the game would be the almost pixel perfect precision requested to navigate through laser traps, fast enemies and other progressive obstacles to be found laid in your way.
