You can change waveform with left or right click, and you will only take damage from waves that are the same waveform as you.</p>\r\nOpen source tools\r\n<p>This game and the engine it's built on were created using the following open source libraries:</p>\n<ul><li>GLFW (Window management, input handling)</li>\n<li>glad (OpenGL header)</li>\n<li>glm (Math)</li>\n<li>PortAudio (Audio)</li>\n<li>stbi (Texture loading)</li></ul>\n<p>In addition, the textures were created in GIMP.</p>\r\nCompiling\r\n<p>GLFW and PortAudio will need to be compiled into static libraries first. In addition, you will need to acquire a glad.c file for your desired version of OpenGL. Everything else is a matter of including the right folder.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T06:42:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19a/19a88c090933a110d05c0b7d53ec928e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ItsHighNoon1"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
