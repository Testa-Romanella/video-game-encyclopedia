{"id": 416118, "slug": "the-psychic-youth", "name": "The Psychic Youth", "name_original": "The Psychic Youth", "description": "<p><em>The Psychic Youth\u00a0</em>is a fantasy-adventure visual novel with Action RPG battles with gameplay inspired by adventure game classics like Squaresoft's\u00a0<em>Radical Dreamers\u00a0</em>and Templar Games'\u00a0<em>Mata Nui Online Game\u00a0</em>and written in the style of classic cartoons like Columbia's\u00a0<em>The Real Ghostbusters\u00a0</em>and Hanna-Barbera's\u00a0<em>The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo</em>\u00a0that was evented/programmed in a 20-hour time limit (time spent planning, animating, and creating graphics was not counted towards this limit- only time spent in-engine was counted towards the 20 hours).\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A week before the events of the game, ace psychic Aero and his vampire bat familiar Delphi attended an auction of old magic memorabilia. One of the items at auction, an ancient journal that once belonged to the eighteenth-century nobleman Count Henry Gigax (a legendarily eccentric character who claimed to be a sorcerer), emitted a strong psychic signal undetectable by non-psychics. Aero purchased the book and found that its last six pages were not only blank, but the source of the signal! Their curiosity piqued, the duo set out to investigate the Count's castle. They finally arrive at their destination in the dead of night and set out to unravel the Count's conundrum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's only one small, itsy-bitsy problem: the castle contains many, many ghosts.</p>\n\n<p>Explore the haunted castle's 8 rooms and solve the mystery of the missing pages! In the castle, you'll encounter several specters charged with guarding the pages. Depending on the actions you take, the outcome of these encounters will change- make the right choices and they'll give the pages to you freely. Make the wrong choices and you'll have to use your formidable psychic powers- dash, air-dash, barrier, energy blast, and the six powerful combination abilities known as the Psi-Skills- to fend them off in dynamic, fast-paced Action RPG battles (made possible by Moghunter's amazing LMBS plugin)!</p>\n\n<p>Who was Count Gigax? Why did he hide the last six pages of his journal? What exactly befell the Count and his servants, and why do their shades haunt the castle's hallways? Collect all 6 pages and the truth about the castle and its enigmatic owner will be revealed!</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you enjoyed\u00a0The Psychic Youth\u00a0and its particular brand of story-heavy gameplay, it's likely that you'll also enjoy my main project MechScape!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T02:20:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c6/5c6b5085814f799a22fc62d358f94d37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MechScapeZH"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
