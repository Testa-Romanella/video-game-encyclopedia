Well, not really as you can see.</p>\n<p>The Sykkuno dress-up game is mostly done, but I'm also accepting future submissions for both Sykkuno AND other amigops members. (I couldn't help myself of course.)</p>\n<p>This was partially made because I wanted to have a comprehensive page of all the syktwt artists around cause they're all super lovely, so please check out the artists that helped! <br/></p>\n<p>Also, if you're one of those lovely artists and you haven't had a chance to add a piece I <em>highly</em> encourage you to reach out! At least, if you're interested of course.
