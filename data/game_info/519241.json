Each character is randomly generated with its own polarity of love and hate. Based on these values, they form connections of love or hate with the others.<br/>A character lacking love will attract one with a positive love charge. The same happens for hate. Playing your life or death cards you'll decide their faith, breaking bonds, creating new ones and writing their story. But beware, in this universe life and death are always balanced. Play a life card and you'll be dealt a death one. There cannot be life without death or death without life.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:04:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c1/1c1ba9b18fa3d625ea1ce257846da1a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mikofer"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
