Speed can be adjusted.<br/>\u3000Ejaculation: The ejaculation gauge builds up as you continue to piston, and when it is full, you can ejaculate. 4.<br/><br/><br/>4. equipment enhancement<br/>Point gain: Skill 1 is gained by impacting the circular gauge in the upper right corner until it runs out.<br/>For this Skill 1, you can strengthen one of the skills by one level.<br/>Items that can be strengthened (3 levels):<br/>Left Tentacle: Speed of auto-attack, intensity of stimulation<br/>Right tentacle: speed of auto-attack, intensity of stimulation<br/><br/><br/>5. settings<br/>Move location: you can choose between the experimental facility and the outside environment.<br/>Screen Settings: Window size can be adjusted.<br/>Sound settings: Volume, sound effects, etc. can be adjusted.<br/><br/><br/>6. precautions<br/>This device is a fictitious simulation and does not actually harm humans.<br/>During the shock transfer by the blocking device, any attack will be disabled. Attempts to attack during this period will be ineffective.<br/>Please use this device with caution and follow the instructions.<br/><br/><br/>7. troubleshooting<br/>7.1 When the device operation is unstable<br/>\u3000Problem: The operation of the device is unstable or does not exhibit the expected behavior.<br/>\u3000Solution: Reset the instrument's system using the \"\"\"\"Restart\"\"\"\" option in the configuration menu.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T02:45:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/30b/30b0b6d6ea0f6b40c37128e1c16841bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ODODODO"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["ODODODO"], "esrb_rating": null}
