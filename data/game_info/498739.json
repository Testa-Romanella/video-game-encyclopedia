Be careful though, getting out won't be as easy as getting in. Make your way through various challenges involving breaking platforms, lasers, and more as you try to bypass security to make it to the roof and get out. The game takes about 10-20 minutes to complete but can vary per person.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game by armedturret</p>\n<p>freesound.org sound effects:<br/>Gun Cock sound effect by woodmoose<br/>Gun Shot by Bird_man<br/>Explosion by SpaceLife<br/>Alarm by Vendarro<br/>Electronic Ping by shimsewn<br/>Helicopter Blades by UnderlinedDesigns</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T04:53:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91a/91a7de5d700e8475704c4b56e78bc977.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["armedturret"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
