But no one could also prove that \"the past\" is real. It's possible that I just \"existed\" now, and my memories were just fabricated.</em></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>\n<p>This is me right now, lost, confused, and don't know where to go. Maybe I was just being born last night, but somehow, \"my past\" still haunted me. I can't remember it, but they said I am the one responsible who dropped the helicopter.</p>\n<p>Fuck! If only I could remember something. I can't even remember my own name. But why?! Even though I can't remember my own name, but I can remember the one who made me like this?!</p>\n<p>It's not only that....I'm not even sure if I'm a human being. Not after what happened today. I can stop the rain. No, it's not like I can change rain to sunny weather...I make thousand droplets of rain stop falling, hanging it in the air like defying the gravitation around me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>.... Far from the bottom of my heart, I'm sure that I have to end all of this.</p>\n</em>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><em>My name is --------------, let me tell you my story.</em></p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally after about 1 month of development, I proudly release Chapter 1 of ALLBLACK in visual novel format\u00a0\u00a0<br/>This chapter covers Book 1 of ALLBLACK Light Novel.
