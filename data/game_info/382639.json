Can you turn your empty field (medium-sized) into a thriving ecosystem? Do battle with invasive weed species through strategic placement of beautiful plants like \u2018Tree\u2019. </p>\n<p>Tutorial (reading this is cheating):\r\nClick on tiles to select, toolbar to perform actions on them (drop or extract water, place plants).\r\nPress end turn when you finish.</p>\n<p>Water management is important, parts of the medium-sized field will dry out if they don\u2019t have enough water. This looks awful and you will be straight back to managing smaller fields by the end of the year.\r\nUse \u2018scoop water\u2019 to pick up water from sources, use \u2018water\u2019 to distribute around your medium-sized field.</p>\n<p>Place plants to get your medium-sized field looking as it should, and to ward off weeds that might appear.\r\nDifferent plants have different functions, but they must be watered and grown to maturity to perform those functions.</p>\n<p>Blue plant: pulls and distributes water to its surroundings\r\nPurply plant: drains water quickly from surroundings, good for depriving weeds of water and killing them. Also good for ruining the surrounding ecosystem.\r\nTree: defensive plant that can block water drainage when used correctly, prevents scrub from forming.</p>\n<p>(you can read again now)\r\nThe medium-sized field is yours now.
