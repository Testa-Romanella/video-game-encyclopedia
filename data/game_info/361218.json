To be specific, he loves triple extra chocolate\u00a0fudge cookies. He loves them so much he will run through any obstacles to get just one.</p>\n<p>Sadly though, Pointy has a chronic condition where he must plan the exact path he wants to take before he moves anywhere. That's where you come in! You can help pointy think out his path beforehand so he makes it through safely.</p>\n<p>This is a submission to the GMTK 2019 Game Jam!\u00a0 The theme this year was, \"Only One\". Pointy and the Path of Least Resistance came from the simple idea that you can only move in ONE dimension: up and down the path! The one path you draw must take you through the whole room, from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Controls for anyone who didn't get the simple ones in-game:</p>\n<ul><li>Draw Line - Hold and drag left mouse button from the start.</li><li>Toggle Pointy - Press the space bar.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:39:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f5/3f5bed32f442aa4b128e0bc2617785a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["floofy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
