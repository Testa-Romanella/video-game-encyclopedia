Defend against multiple enemies as they try to kill you or damage the map by\u00a0placing timed bombs. Divide your attention between damaging crystals, killing enemies or pushing bombs away. You must preserve every tile you can, as water becomes a dangerous acid during the last level.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD (or Arrow keys) - Movement</li><li>Mouse cursor - Aim weapon</li><li>Left mouse click - Attack with weapon</li><li>Right mouse click - Activate shield</li><li>Numbers 1 and 2 (or Mouse scroll wheel) - Change weapon</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The sword is more damaging than the bow.</li><li>Water may not be dangerous at the beginning, but you won\u2019t beat the last level without enough ground!
