After a collision with an asteroid, you lose communications with your pilot (your dog). You need to guide him, but how?</p>\n<p>In this game, you need to create a code to tell your dog what to do. That's problem solving, not puzzle solving: your role is not to understand how the dog thinks but how he will adapt to what you (literally) throw at him.</p>\n<p>With your assistance, your dog will avoid asteroids, put out fires, fight space pirates and, above all, call for help! Your goal is to contact help with your radio while surviving all the other hazards.<br/></p>\n<p>TL;DR: this game contains:</p>\n<p>- the creation of a socks-based code;<br/></p>\n<p>- an advanced AI (the dog) that tries to understand you;<br/></p>\n<p>- some beautiful pixel art (sorry for that).</p>\n<p>You can disable the tutorial in the menu (press P). A hard mode is also available if the game is too easy for you.<br/></p>\n<p>I would like to thank very much the composer Robby Duguay for his free pico-8 music.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:57:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be5d05b9883d65949a92f72994baf88b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["cpiod"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
