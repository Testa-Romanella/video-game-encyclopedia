The game gives points which are distributed by the purity of singing, as in how well does one manage to stay on tune. It doesn&#39;t matter if you change octaves in the middle of the song or what words are you singing in (it doesn&#39;t have a word recognition), so your singing is rated by how well you manage to hit the correct note at the correct time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2007-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-31T15:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/23771cb378971bf1526f1cd2b71a160e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": ["SCE London Studio"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
