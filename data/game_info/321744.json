The Topic was \"Strange\u00a0Garden\" and I am excited to present you my submission.</p>\n<p>In Alchemist Millionare, you are trying to build up a farm and sell potions, why staying alive long enough to become a millionare. Every night you defend against monsters with your sword and the potions you make.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Since this is a 6 Days project it is kinda unfinised. I will continue developing it, but at the current state some helpful mechanics are missing and bugs can appear at the strangest places. It may be terribly inbalanced, I had not enough time for proper balancing. Feel free to report anything you stumble upon!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-24T05:59:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9f416db9580ba646a843f61f97280d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yapsinho"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
