Snood was released for Mac OS in 1996 as shareware, then for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows in 1999. An adaption for Game Boy Advance was developed by Rebellion Developments and released by Destination Software in 2001, and an iOS version was developed by Iron Galaxy and released by EA Mobile on May 8, 2009. Dobson founded Snood, LLC to sell the game.</p>\n<p>As in Puzzle Bobble, connecting three or more identical Snoods makes them disappear from the board. When the board is cleared, the level advances. If the Snoods reach the bottom of the screen, a life is lost. Play is not time-limited in most game modes.</p>\n<p>A sequel, Snood 2: On Vacation, was developed by Gravity-i and released by Destination Softare for Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS in October 2005 and November 2005 respectively.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1996-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/209/209d4bdfa3d5b255daf4e5d69583c76b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "Classic Macintosh", "PC"], "developers": ["Rebellion", "Iron Galaxy", "small", "Snood", "(iOS)"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["small", "(GBA)", "EA Mobile", "(iOS)", "Destination", "Snood"], "esrb_rating": null}
