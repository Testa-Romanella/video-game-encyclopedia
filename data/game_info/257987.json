Lucifer and his Diablos Legion had almost won the war, but somebody from the Daegon Clan appeared, and stood up against the entire legion, supernaturally undefeated. His name was Lapans. Later he claimed the Fire Throne and conquered the Demon World.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Three thousand years later...\r\n  </p>\n<p>Three great heroes are destined to save the Kingdom of Trilands from the evil Demon King, Lapans, who wants to destroy the Mortal World for fun, indeed an evil-stupid plan of total destruction. But in the final dungeon, the heroes are defeated easily. It's strange, since the fate does the opposite of what the prophecy told the humans to believe : the destined heroes will prevail, no matter how strong the villain is. This questionable \"destined-but-failed\" issue will be investigated by the Demon King himself, Lapans. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Easy Leveling, Intense Battle\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p>You can build your skills &amp; attributes without level-grinding.
