We made it\u00a0to apply and critically engage with Rilla Khaled's \"Reflective Game Design\" (2018) theory, so that Mikael and Elias could write their Bachelor thesis about the process of applying Khaled's theory into practice. The game is intentionally designed to cause disruption, failure, and surprise at certain points in order to evoke reflective thoughts about it's systems in the player.</p>\n<p>The game is based on a prototype which was created in one week\u00a0in a previous course.
