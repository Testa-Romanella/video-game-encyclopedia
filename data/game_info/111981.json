Use your relative agility wisely, avoid the deadly spinning brown tiles, and you might just reach the top. You must reach the green flags at all costs, even if it means getting hives.</p><p><em>This game was created for a game jam.</em></p><p><strong>Jump, Larry, jump! </strong>And one day, you'll (probably) learn how to levitate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63d/63d0e5ad1bcf3029339ad4e2850e8168.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Black Shell Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
