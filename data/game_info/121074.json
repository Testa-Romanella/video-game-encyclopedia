These things can include a break from life struggles, joy, wonder, and bringing people together through their shared experiences with fantasy. The hope is to break the bad stigma behind using fantasy as a means to escape. This project is an interactive world of my creation where things happen that you can never experience in real life. </p><p>Background music for Forest by Selulance<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d5/3d580e92186da991249559578da2965a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameDesign@LTU"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
