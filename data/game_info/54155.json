WrestleMania also marked the beginning of a long relationship between Acclaim and the WWF which lasted ten years. Released just months prior to WrestleMania V, it was intended to help build up to that event. The game&#39;s title screen features the tagline for WrestleMania III: &quot;Bigger. Better. Badder.&quot;<br />\nRare later developed a follow-up game, WWF WrestleMania Challenge.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-25T16:37:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0f28514fa94d14bb40fe3a86244d6e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.25, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 9, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 308, "game_series_count": 9, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["NES", "Commodore / Amiga"], "developers": ["Rare"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Acclaim Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
