There's no goal for now, just play around with the physics. Don't forget how magnets work - opposites attract.</p>\n<p>The challenge was to make it in 3 hours but it took me more la 6 hours, even after 1 day of testing the physics.<br/></p>\n<p>WASD - move</p>\n<p>E or Q - change magnet polarity (F change polarity of both)<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse - camera</p>\n<p>***UPDATE: Linux version is up! Let's also hope it works!</p>\n<p>***Sorry I wasn't able to do a Linux version for now. I know no code and just started 2 months ago on game developing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:15:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46de54e5ebd29d7012322cc39fc904b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chestionar Online"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
