The ladder cannot\u00a0be reached yet, so there might be puzzles to solve or minigames that require the skill to\u00a0adeptly move inside this VR environment to reach the next level. The goal is to move\u00a0through a number of such rooms, each one challenging the player in a different way, to\u00a0reach the exit at the top and with that, freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We developed this game as a university project for Game Design and Development 2 at TU Graz. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:32:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d31/d31211e4af948b9b53c8f09aa7d9d1cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AntiDog"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
