Immerse yourself inside Symmetria and find the backstory behind every faction. Not everything is as it seems...<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>COUNTLESS PLAYSTYLES</strong> - There are multiple distinct methods to play Cubelander! Will you let your towers take the front seat, bolstering your defensive capabilities, and decimating enemies, or build up a resource empire and stall until a stronger defence? Or will you rely on your faithful defenders and support towers to do such a job, and take a hands-on approach? Or will you fire orbital strikes everywhere and obliterate waves of enemies? Cubelander makes a tower defence map ever more interactive, with enemies defenders and towers seamlessly interacting amongst each other! Discover every combination of synergizing towers, and master the distinct playstyles!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>INTERACTIVE MAPS</strong> - Fight inside 4 unique environments! (We're not going to spoil), and overcome the unique challenges of each environment, and use the track to your advantage. Defeat each kind of enemy, which each possess a different, significant threat to the safety of your cores!<br/><br/><strong>BRUTAL BOSSFIGHTS</strong> - Take on the strongest commanders of the Geometric Invasion - from a cubic nightmare, to the leader of the geometric void himself! Fight heart-stopping bossfights that test your tower defence skills (and quick decision making) with multi-phased bossfights that have a wide range of attacks!<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>EASY OR... INFURIATINGLY DIFFICULT</strong> - Adjust the difficulty of the game as you wish. Play on Casual for a laid back experience, (or for the lore) or play on Invictus mode and have to re-learn the game again! (Only for the most cunning). Test your strategical prowess in elite special stages!<br/><br/><strong>This game designed is for EVERYONE.</strong> Whether you are a tower defence champion or just a casual player, the game has something for YOU. A complete beginner would feel totally comfortable starting at 1-1 on casual mode, whereas a pro may go for that Invictus  3-S (hardest level on the hardest difficulty) Nothing is unbeatable with enough tower enhancements!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T06:01:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6a/f6ab4e3fe087188d32fb8abee6681e9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 89, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anthony Wu", "TheRealWuka", "James Jiang"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Hyperreal Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
