Using Godot 3.4 to push the graphics as far as I could. Created and coded by Andres Hernandez, with art from Abdullah Kesikba\u015f, and music from 2050. Made in about 1 month.</p>\n<p>Press Escape to view the options. Space to toggle cinematic camera. WASD or Arrow keys move around. Mouse to look.</p>\n<p>Supports 3D glasses. To experience Decay in stereo 3D, you'll need red/cyan anaglyph 3D glasses. The ones from Pro-Ana or BIAL are the best quality.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is a high end demo and requires a modern machine. If you have an old computer or integrated graphics, it is likely the app will not load. That said, there is a low spec mode for computers that are still good but only slightly older.<br/></p>\n<p>Launch with \"Decay.exe --preset=lowspec\" to force a graphics setting (can also use \"ultra\", \"quality\" or \"performance\"). Presets can also be changed in the demo menu.<br/></p>\n<p>Download for free, if you wish, but consider giving a donation if you liked it. I paid to license the art and music, and worked on this full time for a month (plus marketing costs). If you'd like to see more projects like this in the future, I'd appreciate the support. Thanks.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T03:52:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/993/993f45123bca637ef226ea8a4f5559bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Andres Hernandez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
