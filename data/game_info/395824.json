They get wind of a story on Togo Road. When they arrived, it looked like a bomb was dropped in the area. Who, or what, what could have caused it, and why? The answers will eventually point them in a very specific direction.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Well, this is it! The finale of the so-called Matsumori series! However, I'm aiming to make this game more stand-alone than the other titles. I might look into having some kind of in-game encyclopedia to help smooth things out on this front.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Personal Background:\u00a0<br/>This game doesn't really have as much of an involved story behind it's creation as\u00a0<em>Matsumori Days</em>\u00a0or\u00a0<em>Arbiters From Another World</em>, sadly. Actually, to be honest, I'm thinking that making this incarnation of the game will\u00a0<strong>be</strong>\u00a0this game's \"involved story\"!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T04:21:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1be/1be9a70addc3412b4b7d011e7d89242e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JGBR Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
