You should have arrived at your grandmother's house several hours ago, but you somehow made the wrong turn and ended up lost in the wilderness. Right before you think you just lay down and accept your fade, you see a Noodle Club Restaurant. A miracle. You enter the Noodle Club, a terribly run down place, to warm up and have a noodle dish. Not knowing that this Noodle Club Restaurant is the Russian Mafia HQ; where they bring in business partners for a noodle dish, which is poisend, so they can take their money and get rid of the business partners. You of course don't know that the noodle dish is lethal; how long will you sip until you stop and it is too late?\"</em><br/></p>\n<p>The game is a small but fun interpretation of the iconic Russian Roulette.</p>\n<p>All assets (except the font) are done Solo, by me.
