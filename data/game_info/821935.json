No original box and the instructions were missing most pages. There was a hand-written notebook with the source code.</p>\n<p>The program was compiled as best we could, but there were some issues because it wasn\u2019t originally written in English. Or Spanish, French, German, Swiss, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Bokmal, Afrikaans, or Portuguese.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues with this please reach out to us, as we might be struggling with similar symptoms.<br/> </p>\n<p>From what we can tell the controls are fairly intuitive. Mouse and left click to interact. Roll your cubes. Lock them in by clicking them, they\u2019ll turn blue. Then roll, or throw, the remaining cubes. \r\nYellow cubes can be undone, Blue cubes cannot be undone. Red cubes belong to the\u00a0enemy!<br/> Choose Wisely.\r\nBuild up your damage by rolling dice combos.\u00a0 If you roll no damage you get a ZONK! and lose all of your built-up power.\r\n<br/>\r\nSelect your friends and submit to the Roll of the Cubes!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>If you have information about this game please join us on our discord. <em>https://discord.gg/uuzWSfUyq4</em></p>\n<p>---<br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Code </strong>- Samuel Sousa\r\n</li><li><strong>Art </strong>- Jonathan Drain\r\n</li><li><strong>Music </strong>- Alvaro M\u00e9ndez\r\n</li><li><strong>Design</strong> - Samuel Sousa, Jonathan Drain\r\n</li><li><strong>Narrative </strong><strong>Design </strong>- Nathan Rad\r\n</li><li><strong>Continuity </strong><strong>Director </strong>- Elsa Maul\r\n</li><li><strong>Best Boy</strong> - Demo Van\r\n</li><li><strong>Choreographer</strong> - Tad O'Rai\r\n</li><li><strong>Catering </strong>- THE MOHR\r\n</li><li><strong>Transportation </strong>- S.S.
