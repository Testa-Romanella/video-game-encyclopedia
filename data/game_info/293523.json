If yes, this might be a game for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As of writing, February 2019, the game is still in very early development, but the idea is for this to game a sandbox/playground/simulation game, where you can simply play around with fireworks.</p>\n<p>The version you see here on itch.io is a kind of simplified version, call it a demo. The real version, for PC, contains more content and performs a lot better than this HTML5 version.</p>\n<p>If you find the game just remotely interesting - please come to my YouTube channel and subscribe to follow along the development of this game.</p>\n<p>Visit my\u00a0YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>- Enjoy! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T04:58:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bef/bef54b07408dd71e0278a17135141e75.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Laumania"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
