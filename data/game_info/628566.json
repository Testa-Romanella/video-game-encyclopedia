No indication on controls or what you have to do,\u00a0 I let you discover it! <br/>Please notice that it is a prototype. There's no music, almost no juice, no UI, no menus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any comment would be appreciated, and if you want to give an opinion, feel free to do it!!! Here are some questions to make you think:\u00a0<br/>Was it fun? How does it feel to play? Is a tutorial really important, or you can figure out how to play without it? Do you want more levels? Was it too difficult, or too easy? Did you get tired quickly? What else would you like to see?</p>\n<p>I hope you like it, and have fun!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T08:36:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/322/3225fb3320087850fd4c0c7a91a85d1d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["wildBass"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
