{"id": 317372, "slug": "forbidden-treasures", "name": "Forbidden Treasures", "name_original": "Forbidden Treasures", "description": "<p>Forbidden Treasures is a 2D, PC Platform game where the player plays as a knight and explores/goes through an abandoned temple/ruins. The player moves by using the left/right arrow keys to move left and right while also using the space bar to jump.</p>\n<p>The goal in each of the levels is for the player to first find the hidden key somewhere in the ruins and then get it into the treasure chest that's always at the end of each level. In each level, after the player gets the key to the level's treasure chest, the player is then able to proceed to the next level.</p>\n<p>One thing about Forbidden Treasures is that it's a progression of difficulty in that each level is a bit more challenging and exciting than the previous level. As each level passes, the challenges become more interesting and sophisticated to where it provides a good struggle and an interesting gameplay for users to have fun no matter what. The gameplay consists of exploration, traveling, and exploring around the ruins while also having to jump across obstacles designed to be old columns/ruins.</p>\n<p>My goal is to make a fun, interactive game that challenges players in a good creative\u00a0way while keeping them interested along with aiming to bring the idea of the term abandonment alive and invoke some type of a\u00a0feeling among players.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Forbidden Treasures is also based on an abandonment theme so the entire game is designed to represent old ruins and emphasize the idea of abandonment such as time/events forgotten. By downloading Forbidden Treasures, you'll not only get to play the levels, but also have access to the provided assets used in the game. All the assets in Forbidden Treasures were from the Unity Asset Story specifically from Free Platform Game Assets, Starfield Skybox, Stone and Ice Blocks, Tasty_Characters-Castle Pack, and by Tiny Fantasy Icons. Also, the provided music throughout the game was called \"Arcade Music Loop.wav\" by the creator joshuaempyre on Freesound.org at\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/joshuaempyre/sounds/251461/</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>-The entire game is designed to represent abandoned ruins so all the platforms either have cracks, jungle vines, or both.</p>\n<p>-The game mechanics also use floaters which allow players to bounce up to higher altitudes which can help them land on even more different platforms. They're like trampolines that make the whole process of jumping both and challenging in that they can also be a bother if they transport the key to a different location.\u00a0In Forbidden Treasures, these floaters have the asset of green bushes which are scattered all over the game.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, they allow more style to the gameplay.</p>\n<p>-Beginning with level 2, players will be introduced to a water asset. At first, it was the original plan to make the water asset to where if a player jumps in the water, the player would have to restart the level to make the levels a bit challenging. However, it was later realized that the water assets can be used for a better purpose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-As you progresss through the game, you'll be exposed to the water asset in that it doesn't kill the knight, instead the knight just goes straight through it and it can cause the player to move a bit slower just like normal water. Overall, it allows for an appropriate challenge while also providing itself as a great opportunity for players to advance through the level.</p>\n<p>-Forbidden Treasures is both fun and allows for players to explore while also having an intended path to proceed. It really represents the theme of abandonment while also encouraging player exploration and having fun bouncing around the levels and going through obstacles that keep players addictive and interested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All that's left now is one question: Are you ready\u00a0for the journey?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T05:35:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/2658539017a962b8fc5e17264155c1e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hugo Lopez"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
