{"id": 783004, "slug": "apple-frenzy", "name": "Apple Frenzy", "name_original": "Apple Frenzy", "description": "<p>This is a mini-game I developed to further my knowledge in Unity.\u00a0<br/>It is an iteration on the\u00a0Apple Picker prototype, which adds up a whole new functionality.</p>\n<p>The play can drag around a group of baskets and can click the mouse buttons to swap basket positions:<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Left Mouse Click: </strong>Swaps the baskets in a clockwise manner;</li><li><strong>Right\u00a0Mouse\u00a0Click: </strong>Swaps the baskets in a counter-clockwise manner;</li></ul>\n<p>A player must catch the apples with the basket whose color matches that of the apple. Spoiled apples and Sticks can be caught by any basket. Therefor, we have:</p>\n<ul><li>A\u00a0<strong>green apple</strong>\u00a0can only be caught by the\u00a0<strong>green basket;</strong><br/>\n</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>red apple</strong>\u00a0can only be caught by the\u00a0<strong>red basket;</strong><br/>\n</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>golden apple</strong>\u00a0can only be caught by the\u00a0<strong>golden basket;</strong><br/>\n</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>spoiled apple or stick</strong>\u00a0can be caught by <strong>any\u00a0</strong><strong>basket but the player\u00a0</strong><strong>loses a life;\u00a0</strong></li></ul>\n<p>As for scoring, the game has a combo bar, which progresses as the player picks<strong> good apples (green, red and golden)</strong>. It works like this:</p>\n<ul><li>Picking up a\u00a0<strong>spoiled apple or a stick</strong>, <strong>resets the combo</strong> <strong>progress</strong> back to 0;</li><li>Letting a <strong>good apple fall to the ground</strong>, <strong>resets the combo</strong><strong> progress</strong> back to 0;</li><li>To get a <strong>2x multipler</strong>, a player need to catch <strong>10 good </strong><strong>apples in a row</strong>;</li><li>To get a <strong>3x multipler</strong>, a player need to catch <strong>20 good </strong><strong>apples in a row</strong>;</li><li>To get a <strong>4x multipler</strong>, a player need to catch <strong>30 good </strong><strong>apples in a row</strong>;</li></ul>\n<p>A player is also rewarded if she's on a streak, where<strong> picking 100 apples good apples</strong>, gives you an<strong> extra life</strong>. But, ihe player drops\u00a0<strong>3 good apples in a row, she loses a life.</strong></p>\n<p>A gust of <strong>wind will also occasionally appear, making sticks fall from above,\u00a0</strong>and add a bit of drag to the falling apples.</p>\n<p>[NOTE] - Options not yet enabled.</p>\n<p><strong>This project is available to download, on\u00a0GitHub.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T10:03:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/358417a146f93ca77e23623f369ab076.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shaman37"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
