There will probably be minor bugs. <br/>We used some base assets to start the game as well textures built into unreal engine. Most of the assets have been changed heavily.</p>\n<p>Music and sound is all original. <br/>If you find issues or have questions, feel free to contact us: info at virtuaworlds.io.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>**** KNOWN ISSUES ****</p>\n<p>GIF and Screenshot feature are experimental and don't work on some computers. <br/>Performance could be better, but this is basically it for the gamejam version. <br/>Low frame rate on intel i5 with integrated graphics. <br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>****ASSETS AND TOOLS****</p>\n<p>Engine Software: Unreal Engine 4<br/>Audio Software: Propellerheads Reason, Audacity<br/>Graphics: Photoshop, Blender</p>\n<p>SEE THE INCLUDED\u00a0README.TXT FOR FULL ASSET CREDITS.</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
