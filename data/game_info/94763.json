{"id": 94763, "slug": "risk-system", "name": "RISK SYSTEM (itch)", "name_original": "RISK SYSTEM (itch)", "description": "<p>In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter through the use of a Dimensional Gate. Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.<br/><br/>A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.<br/><br/>In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.</p>\n<p>GAME PLAY:</p>\n<p>-Increase your B-Meter &amp; firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you net!</p>\n<p>-Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful \"Risk Shots\". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!<br/><br/>-Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space &amp; modify your attack!<br/><br/>-Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!<br/></p>\n<p>-Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and utilize \"Risk Shots\" to string together combos and increase your score multiplier!<br/></p>\n<p>-Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance and actions taken during missions!<br/><br/>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>-There is now a custom controls configuration menu. This is especially useful if your controller doesn't appropriately map the default configuration to the correct buttons. You can now choose to map movement to the right analog stick as well as shift the right analog stick movement by 90 degrees if it makes usage more comfortable. The default controls are A/X to Fire,B/Circle to use the Barrier Breaker, Left Shoulder/L1 to Barrel Roll Up, Right Shoulder/R1 to Barrel Roll down.<br/></p>\n<p>-The keyboard control scheme uses the C-key to fire, the X-key to perform a barrel roll down, S-key to perform a barrel roll up &amp; the Z-key performs the Barrier Breaker.\u00a0 Arrow keys are used for movement by default however, movement can be set to the number pad or to any letter keys as keyboard control customization is now\u00a0 available.<br/></p>\n<p>NOTES:<br/>-New Demo includes 2 missions!<br/></p>\n<p>-Toggle between full screen and windowed mode by pressing 'F4' or the number '9' key.</p>\n<p>-Game is locked at 60 fps. Player discretion is advised for those with Photosensitive Epilepsy.</p>\n<p>-Both Controller and Keyboard controls can be customized including the mapping of movement with the Control Configuration menu.<br/><br/>-X-Box One controllers and X-Box 360 controllers should have most recent drivers.<br/><br/>-Ps4 controllers will sometimes map incorrectly (the start button to R1 for eg.), this can be corrected by configuring controls.<br/><br/>-If Steam Big Picture support is enabled, control features can act unpredictably. It is recommended to have Big Picture support disabled/off when playing Risk System.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/94b/94b276839b94b4118855a1ee47fa3177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RISK SYSTEM"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
