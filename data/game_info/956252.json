{"id": 956252, "slug": "project-hover", "name": "Project Hover", "name_original": "Project Hover", "description": "<p>A very experimental skating-sim focused on physics, creative skating and customization.</p>\n<p><strong>Physics</strong><br/>The player character is fully physical and\u00a0highly simulated to behave as much as a real person as possible. The goal is to make bails feel as\u00a0impactful and real as possible.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Creative Skating</strong><br/>Instead of pre-made tricks, the game sets up a\u00a0base that then allows you to create and invent tricks similarly to how skating works in real life.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Customization</strong><br/>Both in-game and externally, player settings can be edited to create a setup that's just right for you. jump height, flip force, head trauma tolerance and many many more values can be modified and easily shared between players.</p>\n\n<p>This early in development I'm still building the core of the game, and some parts are more flushed out than others. So for now,\u00a0enjoy learning a new way to skate without a traditional goal in mind.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Good to know</strong><br/>A controller is required to play this game.<br/>You can't change to goofy yet. though switch does work.<br/>All visuals are temporary and will change.<br/>There's currently no audio.<br/>There will only be Windows 64bit builds for the time being. Though Windows 32bit, Linux and potentially Apple OSX is aimed to be supported in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>The game will stay available for free\u00a0during development.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T12:08:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a76/a769042a4432bf06596e335f344d0764.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KabisCube"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
