{"id": 798777, "slug": "steel-love-x-chapter-chibs", "name": "Steel Love X: Chapter Chibs", "name_original": "Steel Love X: Chapter Chibs", "description": "<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Move: Arrow keys (keyboard), d-pad (gamepad)<br/></p>\n<p>Jump: Space (keyboard), south face button (gamepad)<br/></p>\n<p>Dash: Shift (keyboard), LB (gamepad)<br/></p>\n<p>Attack: Z (keyboard), East Face button(gamepad) or West Face button (gamepad)<br/></p>\n<p>Reload level: Backspace (keyboard), select/back (gamepad)<br/></p>\n<p>Skip Dialogue: Enter (keyboard), start (gamepad)</p>\n<p>Go through portal: Up on movement axis<br/></p>\n<p>Note: gamepad controls seem janky. I didn't test them too much while playing the game. From what I've seen they don't work on portals and sometimes dialogue, which aren't terribly important if you wanna play through the actual game with your gamepad and just hit z/up on your keyboard every once in\u00a0 awhile. Keyboard controls should be fine all around.</p>\n<p>Important tip: The game features a The Messenger-esque mechanic, where you get an air jump and refill your air dash from successfully attacking an enemy. This is very important in certain spots, including on the second screen. I try to signal that you need to do it with arrows in the background. Other than that, it's mostly modeled off of Mega Man X (hence the title) and Mega Man Zero, wall jumping and all.</p>\n<p>Also, if you want to see DSD, there will be a portal at the end of a certain area, but you can clearly go up past that portal. Go up past that portal to get to him.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Some effects by\u00a0https://pimen.itch.io/<br/>Tileset by Zack Alvarado:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-tilesets</p>\n<p>Background by Luis Zuno @ansimuz https://opengameart.org/content/warped-caves-pixel-art-pack</p>\n<p>All bangers by Subspace Audio https://opengameart.org/content/5-chiptunes-action</p>\n<p>Portal sprite by\u00a0RodHakGames  https://opengameart.org/content/portals-32-x-48</p>\n<p>SFX by https://dagurasusketch.itch.io/retrosounds<br/></p>\n<p>and rubberduck https://opengameart.org/content/50-cc0-retro-synth-sfx<br/></p>\n<p>The rest by NovaPal<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T15:05:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/326/3260d8b1d44cde7faefc17d4c69b4218.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NovaPal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
