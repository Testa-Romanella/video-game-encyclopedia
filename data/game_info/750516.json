They will attack or interfere with you in different ways.<br/><br/>\"Entities\" are the things you see the most in this game and need to know the best. Their attacks are by no means simple, and you must be familiar with how to stop them to survive in this game. Some Entities look like humans, but they're all machines. Keep in mind, machines can only think and act within a set range.<br/><br/><br/><br/>There are many ways to manage these Entities and stop attacks, but using \"cameras\" accounts for the highest proportion.<br/>The camera will allow you to manage Entities in four zones, but some of them will try to interfere with your camera use.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Extra Entity\" is placed on each floor. These will make each floor feel different and help other Entities attack.<br/>The higher you go up the cellar, the higher your skills will be, and more Entities and more difficult difficulty will wait for you.<br/><br/>This game is very difficult, and it's a series of trials, but never give up. <strong>Someone is waiting for you.</strong><br/><br/><br/>* Since it's a one-man production, there might be some shortcomings in the story. *", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-07T03:45:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c32ef3d670281d3c91e5d2e0ad16452a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["subkan"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["subkan"], "esrb_rating": null}
