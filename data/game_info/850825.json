Use cranes to speed up construction, terraform the open world, build roads and use vehicles to travel to different cities that you or your friends create in solo or coop mode.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Use a crane or a cement mixer to quickly build houses, shops, factories and any other building you can think of. The design is yours: with a large variety of building blocks of different shapes and materials, you can really create whatever you want.<br/>You can then save a schematic from any building you made and start construction of the same building somewhere else.<br/>Share your schematics in the Steam Workshop and use other players' creations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The open world is huge and can be filled with many big cities. An existing road network with thousands of km's lets you reach every part of the 384 km2 map. Build your own roads and they'll be integrated into the navigation system.<br/>Terraform the world with steamrollers and bulldozers - you can even create or remove entire mountains!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Design and produce your own building blocks, items and furniture in factories, and use them to create really unique buildings.<br/>The items you design can also have useful features: create a garage door that opens, an illuminated sign or even a vehicle.<br/>Any other player in your world can then use the items produced in your factories.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Invite your friends to join your world and build new cities or have fun with some role play.<br/>Share your best building schematics in the Steam Workshop and discover what other players have made. You can use prefab buildings, item designs or entire maps from the workshop.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T08:47:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/32986e790bcc4b02084b998ca6a8ce59.jpg", "website": "http://www.technicitygame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 12}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 19, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 409, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Osaris Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["RockGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
