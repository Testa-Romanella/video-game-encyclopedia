Trying to tidy up the house and placing the objects in their meaningful place, memories come back to life reminiscing the warmth and colour of what used to be. Objects have their usual place in the house, right object in the right place, but it's the odd connection that triggers the happier of memory. Find out how meaningful was the life spent in this house for our character. Will he recognize his home or leave it to a new family? Eg: The bicycle in the Garage will obviously need the tire pump, leading to a banal memory of our character inflating the tires. Bring the Teddy bear on the other hand and it will trigger the memory of father and daughter playing together with the teddy bear and the bicycle, it will also colour the room giving a better feeling of accomplishment. <br/><br/>\u2014\u2014\u2014SPOILER\u2014\u2014\u2014 <br/><br/><br/><br/>Failing to recall the happy memories our character will relive his solitary moments in the house, leading to a moderate, uneventful end. Finding all the happy memories, the house will fill with colour and motion, reviving the house and its meaning. Placing all the objects wrongly, the character will feel detached from the house and will decide to sell it<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T06:16:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/129/129ab40e5cf605e5c345bdd6738eba4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["REDROVER Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
