It's the job of the angels to delay the inevitable and save the humans from death as long as possible.</p>\n<p>To do so the angels have three powers. The first power is the ability to create holy walls which cannot be passed by anyone. Not even death.</p>\n<p>The second and third power are materialized in totems which will repel death and gather humans or the other way around.</p>\n<p>HINT: The items can be selected using the keys 1-3 on your keyboard or by clicking on them.</p>\n<p>Help to DELAY THE INEVITABLE!</p>\n\r\nFinally\r\n<p>It was a really fun jam. Hopefully all of you had as much fun as we did and you can now fully enjoy our game.</p>\n<p>For best performance you should obviously download it but most of it should work fine in WebGL. (Except some weird audio bug in unity)</p>\n<p>Leave a comment about things you like and/or dislike.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to play y'all games as well :D.</p>\n<p>## Credits</p>\r\nJobWho dit it :DMUSIC and SOUNDDESIGN\u00a0[Tobias Kiehnlein](https://github.com/TobiasKiehnlein)GRAPHICS and ANIMATION[Hannah](https://github.com/cpthannah97)ANIMATION[Zelberor](https://github.com/Zelberor)PROGRAMMING[Zelberor](https://github.com/Zelberor) and [Tobias Kiehnlein](https://github.com/TobiasKiehnlein)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T20:28:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b08/b08d95dec98b11bb449078a7597f81aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Zelberor", "TobiasKiehnlein", "hannah97"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
