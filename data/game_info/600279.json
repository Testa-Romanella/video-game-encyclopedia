Vampire Mobsters? Parkour Hack and Slash? A game made by a bunch of brand new unity developers for a class? What could go wrong!</p>\n<p>Hi everyone, thank you so much for taking a look at our game. We spent a lot of time working and building everything from the ground up, models, animations, scripts, and coding heck; even the music was made by a group of 5 college students for a unity class. We had a blast and at times wanted to cry, but we are really proud to have been able to make this game and see it become what it is. Granted, it's not perfect, but it's ours!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Goal of the game is simple. All you need to do is kill the vampire mobsters as fast as possible. We really wanted to try to create an interesting experience, so feel free to try running on walls and jumping from building to building and, of course, have fun!</p>\n\n<p>*I feel it is important to note we did not make the textures for all the models and assets, but there are no premade assets used in the game. We did all the models and the texturing of them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:20:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bbf/bbf32a180d2335a8206baa6540a4e61d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["karateka_zander"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
