Gifts reset your size and slow you down which can be a good thing or a bad thing since you have to complete it as quick as possible. Enemies do not see you until you reach a certain size so try to collect gifts when they're nearby!</p>\n\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Nullsleep - game music</p>\n<p>Catalyststuff on freepik\u00a0- enemy icon\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T09:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/575/5752f80cf928108a81fa590f966f2e02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["bratlukandr"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
