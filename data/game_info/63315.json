An appetizer of 24 Ultra Challenging Levels to get you started.<br/><br/>Story Driven:Dive deep into the depths of a deserted facility and uncover the truths behind it's many experiments. You help a group of vulnerable survivors find a way to escape the hostile environment while with each data fragment, you uncover the secrets and stories of the facility's many inhabitants.Semi Open WorldThe game is heavily narration driven, and as such, the campaign is divided into main and side quests, scattered all over a semi-open world setting. Some quests can be found by talking to certain characters, others are a bit trickier to obtain. Some quests fade in and out of availability depending on your in-game decisions, actions, pacing and skill. As you unlock new areas, you gain the ability to traverse between them, to come back to finish quests and challenges.4 Player Local Co-Op:One of the very first reasons why we decided to create RTAG rise is - rage inducing platforming action... with friends. When the levels are too tough, bring a friend over as the revive mechanic will help you to easier master places where you would have otherwise been sent back to the level start right away. But be weary, as The Benefits of Co-Op also bring their own penalties. RTAG rise also features Co-Op specific stories and side quests.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aa91c494b26e55dac6e8e7e640c692d.jpg", "website": "http://eisenstadtstudio.com/rtag-rise.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eisenstadt Studio"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Eisenstadt Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
