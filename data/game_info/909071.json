You will travel through time and space to visit three dying humans and decide whether it's time to harvest their souls...</p>\n<p>Point-and-click filled with dialogues that change the course of the game! With 8 different endings and many variations in between, you better pay attention to unlock them all...\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>(also there's no save function YET so your achievements will be lost on replay :C ).</em></p>\n<p>Made for LudumDare 52 using GameMaker by tired parents of a toddler who had to do great acrobatics to finish the game this weekend.
