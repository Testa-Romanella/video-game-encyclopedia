As the player glides between floating islands, they come to realize that nobody actually wants to read the book. The protagonist, however, has his \u201chead in the clouds\u201d and believes everyone will love it.</p>\n<p>This game is a comment on how artists pour their hearts into their work but often don't feel their efforts reciprocated from consumers.</p>\r\nDevelopment\r\n<p>This was a university project developed in Unity. I unfortunately had to scrap the nice lighting shown in most screenshots thanks to some annoying grading computers, but you can still download the nice lighting build below. Just be aware it has been abandoned and the cheaper lighting build is the final version.</p>\n<p>As the project had to be playable in under five minutes for a university submission, many of my ideas were cut short. Further development could see new challenges like the item puzzles in Heat of the Moment.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T11:27:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c6450ba6dad6d3476a1bbca39ecc1633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Elliot George Mann"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
