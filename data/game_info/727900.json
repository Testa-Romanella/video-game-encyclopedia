But they must be careful as the building is not all as it seems.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>DEVOID</strong>\u00a0is a visual novel with point and click elements created in Ren'Py.\u00a0Navigate through this building and meet your new neighbours. Be careful not to get trapped.</p>\n\n<p>This was\u00a0inspired by liminal spaces and photots of places you've seen in your nightmares. I wanted to try and replicate that calm, melancholy feeling while interacting with the environment. Although parts might look creepy, it's not intended as a horror game, but more mysterious and strange.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Play time is around 5-15 minutes depending on how fast you read or go through the options.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is simple with a linear story. It has\u00a011 endings (10 bad endings and 1 true ending).</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Story/code/art by\u00a0AnizyArt\r\n</li><li>Music from Loyalty Freak Music</li><li>Sound effects from\u00a0Soundly</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for looking at my short\u00a0visual novel!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T06:03:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f65/f653ce6af1a438204f2d722c8d81f325.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["AnizyArt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
