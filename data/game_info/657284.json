Your character loses health over time but he has to use cinder from burnt things to survive better. Basically you need cinder to survive and you have to kill goblins and loot to get it. However, you also have to use cinder to cast and learn spells. There is a caveat to looting, you're gonna wanna be home before it gets dark because at dusk phantoms will spawn and getchu. You have three strikes with the phantoms (exhaustion points basically) the more you get got by them the slower you go, three of em and you die (also dying rn doesnt do anything you j freeze lmao so yea ALT+F4 after you \"die\")</p>\n<p>You can also fight bosses:</p>\n<p>Goblin Archmage spawns after three days at the goblin camp. Basically just shoots a lot at you</p>\n<p>The other boss spawns by killing guardians and using their eye to signal it.</p>\n\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Mouse to look</p>\n<p>Left click to interact and to grab (usually when the cursor is orange)</p>\n<p>Space to cast</p>\n<p>Scroll to select spell</p>\n<p>Right click to use an item</p>\n<p>Put items in the fire to burn them</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T02:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/831/83185085ffff099cfa9acc5349a3c8d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["notnickfaps"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
