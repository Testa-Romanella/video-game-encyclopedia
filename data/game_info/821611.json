Start with 2 dice and 48 health at level 1, and work your way up to 5 dice and 480 health at level 100!</p>\n<p>If that isn't quite your cup of tea, try\u00a0<em>Iron Man Mode</em>, where regen is turned off and every single health point matters! My best is level 8; can you get better luck?</p>\n<p>Buttons:</p>\r\nButtonFunctionKeyboard mappingAAdvance menu/fightZBAdvance menu/fightXXToggle auto-fightA\r\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>GFX:</p>\n<p>Dice - by Refeuh https://opengameart.org/content/dice-collection-d6-d10-16x16px</p>\n<p>Monsters - by GrafxKid https://opengameart.org/content/various-creatures</p>\n<p>SFX: by Me</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T09:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/282/2824c0b83b182e67e47e4d1c8ccab130.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MineRobber9000"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
