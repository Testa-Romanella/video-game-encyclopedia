At its current state I wouldn't even call it a game, but I feel its got potential. Anyways, the enemy A.I. is so bad for now, the music probably gets annoying after the first 3 minutes (assuming you've played that long), the name for the game\u00a0is stupid,\u00a0and there is nothing to do right now but shoot bad guys. And, yes... this is my first game :P</p>\n\n<p>So anyways, this is set in SCP. SCP is basically this world where mankind has to contain anomalies from destroying the world and stuff. At the moment you can play as 4 'classes'. The Scientist, Guard, Janitor (yep u heard me), and Agent. They are probably all unbalanced and crap but who cares ya know. After all this is merely a demo.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, you should give it a shot. Just play around for a while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Dud3rdude.
