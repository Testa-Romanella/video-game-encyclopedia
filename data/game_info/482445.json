This game was made for the Miz Jam 1.<br/><br/>The idea behind this game is you use WarioWare style mini games to act out combat. The left blue box on your screen is your defensive mini games. Winning these means you don't take damage. The right red box on your screen is your attack mini game. Successfully completing these mini games launches damage at your enemy.<br/><br/>I tried to test your reflexes as well as your ability to multitask. Made in ~46 hours All feedback is welcome. Thanks for playing!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Thank you to Miz and all participants for the jam. I can't wait to see your games!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:17:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dbc/dbc5b52a349d3b0841f11a921ed03c3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LusciousNut"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
