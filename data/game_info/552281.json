Due to the fact that I think I missed something with the scaling settings, you'll have to play this in full screen. But don't worry! I think the experience is even better that way!</p><p>Also there is a rare bug during dialogue moments which prevents the player from progressing. I thought I had solved it but apparently it has happened since then. Unfortunately, the only way to get around this is to restart, but since it's a short game I hope you're willing to do so. I would appreciate it. That being said, it is a very rare issue so you're unlikely to encounter it.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!\u00a0</p>\n<p>PS. Please leave a comment. I'm eager for constructive criticism (though I'd prefer to be showered with praise, however unlikely that is) and I want to learn to be better. Everything teaches me something.
