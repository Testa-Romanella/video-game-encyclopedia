I'm in the process of making a Star Trek: Deep Space 9 visual novel/dating sim where you can flirt with all your favorite characters and take part in a dramatic plot and possibly fall in love.</p>\n<p>This is still a Very Very early work in progress and made more for fun than anything else but I hopefully will continue to work on it and refine it. So possible grammar errors, misspellings, and low resolution or missing assets ahoy!</p>\n<p>Any feedback on any of the writing (making it more in character or staying with an exaggerated silly tone for example) or tips on coding choice mechanics is appreciated!</p>\n<p>Anyway, have fun with the silly work I have so far and hopefully I can put the rest of the game together.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9d/d9dc8f8b15f25a978cc21f5bfa1a5b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["andromedarts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
