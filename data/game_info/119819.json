Game represents several people in conctact list. Each with a completely different style and theme. Once the player receives the first message in the chat he has to choose from three possible answers. Longer the answer gives a better attitude with a person you are talking to. After choosing the most convenient answer player has to type it with a keyboard. Main character phone is defective though. Battery level will fall quicker once the player started to type. So you have to choose wisely whether you maintain good relationship or send as many messages as you can. Eventually battery will hit zero and you will see stats with sent letters, scores and resulting character relations based on your performance.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/721/72155e46d0ed09aea3694cded7896bd2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Brolton Mown"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
