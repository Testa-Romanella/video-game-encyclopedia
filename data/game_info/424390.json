{"id": 424390, "slug": "xpcade", "name": "XpCade", "name_original": "XpCade", "description": "XpCade is a simple simulation game. Your character is a fan of the old arcade games. You are in a garage with some machines. In each arcade machine there is a 2D game, you can go near it and play.  In the story the city has been invaded by giant spiders. You can make some missions outside the garage to get supplies and more. Until the current date there is only one machine in the garage, and one mission to do outside, but in the future I'm going to add new machines and missions with the updates.<br/>\r\nThe first machine contains a simple car game: you can drive a car, and complete the large circuit laps. The objective is to make the best lap, in the shortest time. The car is working with manual gears, so you have to hit the up and down contol keys 'w'/'s' or 'up'/'down' arrow keys to change the gear.<br/>\r\nEach gear makes the car run at a different speed.<br/>\r\nIf you are running above the first gear and you go off road, you'll lose a car. You have a limited number of cars.<br/>\r\nThe mission outside is about getting a box with supplies: in the story an helicopter is dropping them for the survivors in a little square in the city.<br/>\r\nThe city is like a maze, made with narrow streets. You have to find the box location pick it up and bring it back to your garage.<br/>\r\nYou must be careful when you move, because the giant spiders are running around the maze.<br/>\r\nWhen you can hear their noise, you can hide and wait them to go away.<br/>\r\nYou are armed with a gun, the gun has 24 bullets, you can shoot a spider if it is in front of you. you can recharge the gun when you pick the supplies box up.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T03:28:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cec5c123343c6ed1a243d71c3fdfd239.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ginodp2015", "Gino Di Pierro"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Gino Di Pierro"], "esrb_rating": null}
