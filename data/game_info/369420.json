Sati can achieve this goal by using her martial arts skills, performing gymnastic routines, modifying her body with power ups, disguise herself as a sentry robot, collecting special weapons. Even if the game is conceived as a fighting platformer, there are more than one way to complete each level. controls are very simple, each of sati's actions can be done by using WASD keys. We focused as much as possible on playability, but we also tried to recreate the freedom and the sharpness of 70s and 80s design. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-30T03:37:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09a/09a72ef6e88b474e2b7284012111b2d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 394, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["henshinhyumanoido"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
