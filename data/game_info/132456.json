Jump between floating bubbles of water, avoiding lasers and asteroids, to collect as many spinning stars as possible. If you fall - no problem - do a barrel roll to jump higher. The game gets harder the longer you play. How many stars can you collect? Shoot for a score that makes you think, \"gnarly, like woah!\"</p>\n<p>Move with WASD or the arrow keys. Pause with space. Barrel roll with shift or ctrl.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing! Contact\u00a0 me at\u00a0@snicklodocus\u00a0or\u00a0@nedmakesgames.
