This is like a godsend for lovers of 'find the difference' games!<br/>Find 10 differences - a classic game familiar to almost everyone and loved by many!<br/><br/>Compare two pictures and find the differences.<br/><br/>In our game I Love Find Differences, you will be absolutely free to access more than 1,500 levels (to download levels you will need access to the Internet). Levels in the game will be periodically added, the game itself will inform you about new levels through notifications (when you first start, the game will ask permission to use them).<br/><br/>If you failed to find all 10 differences - just use the hint or postpone this level and start the next one. Spent hints and level skips are restored after a while, you can also instantly restore them up by watching a short video.<br/><br/>The differences in the game we'd tried to make the optimal size - you do not have to look for a tiny dot in the corner, but there will be no differences occupying half of the picture. If suddenly something is still too small, then zoom functionality will help you.<br/><br/>There is advertising in the game, but it allows this game to be free and make new levels for you.<br/><br/>All images are taken with the personal permission of the author of the image or if the image has a suitable license.<br/>For all questions please contact at contact.iloveftd@yandex.com<br/><br/>We hope you will really love our game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:36:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f9609a96d43cdac164fcd334237236db_0OIPCzc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexander Ryabinin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Alexander Ryabinin"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
