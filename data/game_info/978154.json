Under the careful watch of Cpt. Briggs, you'll learn the basics of planetary survival and kaiju hunting techniques. <br/><br/>Acid Planet is a Strategic Wave-Defense game with elements of Action Roguelike, RTS and Horde-Survival. It's a game for people who like building, strategy, quick runs, risk-reward trade-offs and battles on an epic scale. <h3>BUILD YOUR BASE</h3>Construct towers and drone factories to defend your ship from the horde. Build support towers to buff your offensive capabilities - placement matters. Develop your economy for future waves.<br/><br/><h3>FIGHT THE HORDE</h3>Deploy exotic weaponry and armies of drones to repel waves of mutated monsters. Guide swarms, flank siege monsters and battle challenging elites. <br/><br/><h3>EVOLVE TO PERFECTION</h3>Choose a powerful new ability or upgrade after every wave. Get strong enough to bag an Emperor-class Kaiju. If you're a real hot-shot you can challenge the hellish and experimental HYPER-EVO protocol.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>On the Acid Planet (formerly known as Earth), human beings have sadly become extinct. Under the toxic clouds, hordes of rampaging bio-monsters run wild and have grown to gigantic size. <br/><br/>As a SCAV Corporation clone, you will conduct salvage operations from our orbital station. Be aware of monster activity on the surface. Your top priority is the capture of the Kaiju cores. Human crew are expendable as required.
