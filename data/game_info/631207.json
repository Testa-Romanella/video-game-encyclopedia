This game was made in\u00a0<strong>58 minutes and 49 seconds.</strong> The theme for the jam was\u00a0<strong>Light is Key</strong>.\u00a0In this game you control a flashlight with your mouse, and must find all 10 squares in order to find the final square to win!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was a cool challenge, and while it is far from polished, I am very happy with the fact that I made a playable game with little to no bugs (that I know of) in under an hour! I only started making games 3 months ago, so the fact that I can make games like this, am continuing to learn, and apply these mechanics within the time frame of short game jams is really cool! I hope you all like this game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/1560f806ed6815582d8a02922b4565bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["VeryTori"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
