Ember can move between levels (or sometimes between areas in the same level) by entering 'rat runs', shown as cracks in the wall.</li><li><strong>Use image post-processing:</strong> under the bonnet, the game uses full 32-bit colour \u2013 but for post-processing, we're using a colour reduction and dithering shader. 6 shades per channel are allowed, giving a total of 216 colours that can be displayed on screen.</li><li><strong>Bonus rule:</strong> we were allowed to modify or skip a rule if we used memes to explain our reasoning, but chose not to.</li></ul><p>Embervania was one of the ideas we had going into this - and though the sewer setting wasn't planned, lots of other things (eg. the player sprite) were.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T11:57:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/719/719c9a2679a716c53301bd730c63238c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["STARRIVER"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
