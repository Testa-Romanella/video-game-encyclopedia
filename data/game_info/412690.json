Probably around 4 hours or so.</p>\n<p>You play as a factory worker and have to fulfil contracts. Review and remember the contract well before you start production, pick items on the conveyor belts to make what the customer wants and hand it over for the reviewers to get your score. There's no limit on what you have to score to be able to work on the next contract, so just try to be as precise as possible and / or set your own goals.</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Once you started production you can pick items off the conveyor belts with your mouse (click left). Then place them where you think they belong on the \"Workpiece\" sheet.
