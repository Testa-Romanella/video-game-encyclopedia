You must use the battlefield as well as the troops available to win the day.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Digital Invasion is a game inspired by the likes of X:COM, invisible inc and battle-tech. It's main features are\u00a0-\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Fast paced turn based strategy</li><li>Innovate cover system</li><li>Digital simulation theme similar to that of TABS, Darwinia and other faux simulation themed games</li><li>A 4v4 battle on our Digital Medieval map 2.0</li></ul>\n\n<p>What makes Digital Invasion different is the removal of RNG, instead relying on alternative mechanism to calculate whether or not a target gets hit, and the addition of an alternate activation system to break up player and AI turns.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Where in X:COM cover gave a modifier to the roll of an attacking unit,\u00a0in Digital Invasion\u00a0cover blocks any shots that attempt to pass through its space and then the cover is either degraded or destroyed. As a result, there is a much greater emphasis on flanking around you opponents units, or grouping units to be able to punch through any cover the enemy may have.</p>\n<p>However, with the new Activation system, the player and the AI alternate in taking unit actions (player moves a unit, AI moves a unit) until they have no unit actions left, then repeat. This removes much of the viability of grouping units, and encourages the player to be more proactive in their attacks on the enemy.</p>\n<p>Installation Instructions -\u00a0</p>\n<p>In order to install, simply unzip the folder downloaded, and double click the .exe to open!
