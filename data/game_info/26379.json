Create up to 8 characters based \n      on you and your friends, then fight to the end!\n    </p><p>\n      Welcome to Photo Dojo, where you create a dojo filled with ruthless (or \n      humorous) fighting machines\u2014using images of you and your friends! Use \n      the Nintendo DSi Camera application to take pictures of yourself and \n      your friends in various poses, then use the microphone to record sound \n      effects and dialogue to give your warrior a voice. Choose one of the \n      four available fighting styles, name your character, and you\u2019re done! \n      Better yet, repeat the simple, step-by-step process and create a lineup \n      of up to eight fighters. Complete the setup of your game with the \n      ability to make customized backgrounds and your choice of three awesome \n      soundtracks...then prepare for battle! Two players can share one \n      Nintendo DSi system and face off against each other in a one-on-one \n      grudge match, while single-player mode offers the chance to pick your \n      favorite fighter and take on a relentless wave of opponents of your own \n      creation. If you\u2019re ready for some seriously off-beat Kung Fu \n      action\u2014literally starring you\u2014Photo Dojo\u2019s unique twist on the \n      side-scrolling beat\u2019em up genre lets you use your imagination to set the \n      stage for a fun-filled fight to the finish. May the best warrior win!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T06:05:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea9/ea93261ca8f4107eb0f4fefa2b267a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 269, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
