You can only use AI  rovers to do so (you have to write the AI yourself). The inhabitants of  this world might not take kindly to your presence. Good luck!\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music/sound effects taken from: https://jonas-tyroller.itch.io/wowie-pack\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n  A little more about the game: <br/>- You have to write your own AI for the rovers (and <em>cooperate </em>with them)\r\n<br/>\r\n- Your rovers can mine ore\r\n<br/>-  There are 3 types of ore: iron, copper and gold (look around the map  for a bit to find them. Gold can only be found in the corners of the  map. TIP: there is some iron to the right of your Hub and some copper  south-east)\r\n<br/>- Ore can be used for making more rovers/building turrets/buy upgrades\r\n<br/>\r\n-  Rovers first have to deposit the ore to the Hub before it can be used  (look in the 'help' section in the code editor to learn more)\r\n<br/>\r\n- In the corners of the map are alien hives\r\n<br/>- Aliens will attack you every so often\r\n<br/>- Military rovers can't dig, but can fight the aliens\r\n<br/>- Turrets and military rovers attack automatically\r\n- If your Hub is destroyed, you lose</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T22:27:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6eb/6eb10aa6eab259d95fc2aff07f63d244.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["centrex"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
