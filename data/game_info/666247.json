You the taoist priest protagnist Song must rescue them all.</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>Some schoolgirls unwisely explore a building huanted by a ghost girl,\u00a0who has ghostly blood flowing from her hand and swing\u00a0knifes\u00a0telekineticly. These unwelcomed visiters are trapped in the horror.\u00a0You , the protagnist, is a junior Taoist Priest named Song, who can shoot fulu spell and do light step to fly, come into this building and try to help.<br/>Will you save the civilizans and uncover the story of this ghost?<br/></p>\r\nSurvey\r\n<p>Before i made this game for \"Magical Girl Game Jam #4\", i already have an idea of a Taoist Priest\u00a0themed roguelike game. It was just a concept in mind, and then i find\u00a0this game jam, which gave me a push\u00a0to schedule a solid month, make this smaller size prototype, test the idea, and see if i should invest more.<br/>If you played this game and like it, apart from rating it, please also answer me some question in comments</p>\n<ul><li>How do you feel about the 3d movement/shooting mechanic?</li><li>If you have to play procedurally generated chapters repeatly, do you feel if it's repeative?</li><li>If it's a local multiplayer game, do you think it's better to keep in one view and it should split to multiple view?</li><li>What elements do you want to add in the game?</li></ul>\r\nGame Control\r\n<p>As this is a game jam, I've only made it supports one control method (mouse+keyboard)</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/ZQSD - move</li><li>Mouse - aim</li><li>Left Click - shoot</li><li>Spacebar - jump/float</li><li>E - interact</li></ul>\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n<ul><li>The map generate is not perfect. There is a chance it generates a map without all rooms linked togetable . Sometimes it simply stuck in generate process.</li><li>You can place civillians in wall.</li><li>When you moving civilian to safe zone, please just walk into the circle\u00a0instead of pressing E. Manually placing civilian inside circle\u00a0doesn't count.</li><li>The game may be slow in retina resolution (and no, there is no resolution option)</li><li>restarting a chapter may make the character stuck</li></ul>\r\nGame Hints\r\n<p>****Spoiler alert****</p>\n<ul><li>Please remember that your character can levitate, and it's helpful in lots of situation. You can dodge pawns'\u00a0attack if the timing is right. Several boss fight phases require you to stay up (or down).\u00a0</li><li>You can press + key to gain one health ( and - to lose one). But to fully enjoy the game, i recommand you not to use this cheat key.</li><li>For chapter 1-2, the start point is always at left-top, and the end point is always at right-bottom.\u00a0</li><li>Contradicting with story, civilians in game are invincible. if there are too many enemies, put down the civilians and focus on fighting.</li><li>For chapter 3, you need Kaman to reach the door before you. Just let her lead the way and \"handle\" the classmates in front when you are clearing the threat behind.</li><li>Buckets in the game\u00a0is just a \"kick the bucket\" punchline, there is no easter egg for it.</li></ul>\n<p>(Video:\u00a0Zero Death Play Through)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:45:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2fa80d3fc5d41f1c8e7a14d85aa81d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SunnyChowTheGuy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
