This is done through making him complete a number of different tasks. Shinji Ikari Raising Project is the second and final entry in the Raising Project series of Evangelion games, preceded by Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ayanami Raising Project in 2001. Both games bear a strong similarity to publisher Gainax&#39;s Princess Maker series. The game was released officially in Japanese and Korean, and has received fan translations into English and Russian. The game was written by Nobuaki Takerube, and its artwork was drawn by Kengo Yonekura and Dream Japan Co., Ltd.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2004-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T02:46:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77cde5033e94182d5fc668471c00e673.jpg", "website": "http://www.gainax.co.jp/soft/shinji/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 378, "game_series_count": 12, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gainax"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Gainax"], "esrb_rating": null}
