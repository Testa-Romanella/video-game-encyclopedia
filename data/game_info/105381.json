Both have been promised to each other since birth, and have agreed to the conditions in order to uphold family honor and reputation. Neither have ever seen each other in person but they know <em>of</em> the other. The wedding date was meant to be when the children turned 25 but had to be rushed a few years earlier because of the parents' business issues and the accident -- the accident that left her blind. Ever since that day, she has learned braille and become close friends with a pen pal, one who was also willing to learn braille in order to understand MC. Will her and Ethan's marriage turn out to be \"for better or worse?\" Or does she love the one stranger that she has only communicated with through paper?</p><p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Two endings</li><li>Changeable MC name</li><li>Custom GUI</li><li>Original Soundtrack</li><li>CG Art Gallery</li><li>~7,500 words</li></ul><p>The demo covers the prologue and chapter 1 of the story.<br/></p><p><strong>Team<br/></strong></p><strong>Writers</strong>: Laera-chan, Mama J<strong>Sprite Artist</strong>: Juliastorybored<strong>CG Artist</strong>: Silveth<strong>Logo/GUI Artist</strong>: Valhalla<strong>Background Artist</strong>: Iceramyst<strong>Composer</strong>: Nathan A.
