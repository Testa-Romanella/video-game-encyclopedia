I could remember nothing but him, after the daylight arrived.\u2019</em>\n<p><strong>THE LIGHT HOUSE AND THE WEEKENDS, YOU AND HIM</strong> is a narrative VR experience. It narrates a linear storyline of the repeated dreams and subconscious related to the artist\u2019s previous relationship. The physical qualities of the built objects are influenced by actual-scaled furniture and architecture yet the interactive effects (explosion, transformation, transition) are creating a sense of magical and mythical aesthetics to the player. The complete experience manipulates a player to have a sensation of an engaging emotional connection through the virtual environment.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>The sound and music were designed and composed in collaboration with Guangzhou-based sound designer Xing-Di Wang.<br/></p>\n\r\n* This project has featured the following asset:\r\n<p>Flat Kit: Cel / Toon Shading<br/>by Dustyroom<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/flat-kit-cel-toon-shading-1433...</p>\n<p>MapMagic World Generator<br/>by Denis Pahunov<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/mapmagic-world-generator-567...</p>\n<p>Unity Particle Pack 5.x<br/>by Unity Technologies<br/>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/unity-particle-pack...</p>\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to:\r\n<p>Conor O'Kane</p>\n<p>Alvin Wu</p>\n<p>Donna Li</p>\n<p>Jichen Cui</p>\n<p>Julien Chung-How</p>\n<p>Wendy Wang</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T03:38:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d495b07de24c9a07506e975cd95a6e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Johnny Zhonghao Liang"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
