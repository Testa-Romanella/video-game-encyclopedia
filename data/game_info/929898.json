It took somewhere between 20 and 30 hours to complete, so I'm sure there's plenty of room for improvement even without making fundamental changes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T13:44:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1e3405d269fd9eb8e4de1c1172aca73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Laww.Fella"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
