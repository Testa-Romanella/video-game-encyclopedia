The central idea is kind of the 'waiting room' in Gene Wolfe's Claw of the Conciliator (or at least my fuzzy memories of it), with a bit of Aesop/Wind of the Willows thrown in.</p><p>My main idea was to let player's choices develop via the opening and closing of gates. So there are limited (real time) events that the player must choose to go forward with or not--but other things might be happening. You might choose to abandon a character in one section of the Chapel, or stick around and see what happens.</p><p>That's the idea at least--hope you enjoy the game as far as I got in it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b36/b36bea7fb56d15e161d6cf87c839ffe4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anya Johanna DeNiro"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
