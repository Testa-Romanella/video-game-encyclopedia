In this scene, a gynoid awakens, and it's up to you to uncover the mystery of this lifelike mechanical marvel.<br/><br/>In the first ever 3D game from the creators of the Lloyd the Monkey series, you explore a small area collecting energy cores and upgrades required to progress further and higher up. The journey will be short, but exciting: as you will explore a variety of post-apocalyptic locales and battle death machines as you search for the cores you need.<br/><br/>However, exploration is secondary to survival, as enemies will hit hard and fast with a variety of deadly projectiles and grow smarter as they take more damage, so stealth and skilled aiming are absolutely essential, especially in the flooded ruins you will be exploring. Your goals are to <strong>seek, shoot and survive</strong> in Nea Edem, where the end of the world is just the beginning.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T05:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48182dd0b6d0cb9dfee0a3ddbe4e3fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meyer Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Meyer Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
