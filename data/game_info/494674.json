The goal is simple: find the key to exit the monster's dungeon. The catch\u00a0is your light is running low and you must find torches to supplement the litte light you have while in search of the exit key. If the light runs out, the monster gets you.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Movement - Arrow Keys<br/></p>\n<p><strong>NOTES:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>There is no pause menu and pressing escape will close the window. <br/></p>\n<p>In the menus, arrow keys and enter are used to select. As well, enter is used to go back from the menu selections. Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f94057b523dfe71acd6356083b526132.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["albertmancias"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
