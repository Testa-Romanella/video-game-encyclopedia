Six games on six cartridges hidden around the Midwest Gaming Classic. Can you find them, or will they forever be Lost at the MGC?</p>\n<p>A number of sets of the carts were hidden [ARE to be hidden, the MGC hasn't occurred this year as of this writing] around the convention, each with a very small mini game that would reveal a website, a password, and a number that were all important to beating the game as a whole. (Then one could sit back, relax, and watch the awful credits.)</p>\n\n<p>I'll be updating this page with notes, alternative art assets and game titles, as well as assets for games that were not made for this year's set.</p>\n\n<p>Random Factoids:</p>\n<p>Middle Aged Man was originally named \"The Pillow of Doom.\"</p>\n<p>Madness Maze was made in an attempt to get away from doing a second platformer. Originally there were going to be two games of each type: top down, first person, and platformer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T07:39:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67ba3f7a5c07125666409e366175c664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stickyeye"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
