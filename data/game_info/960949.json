One of them was the building of Sweden\u2019s first nuclear reactor, <br/>\r\nReaktor 1, or R1, buried 25 meters directly underneath the the ground, <br/>\r\nand within a 1 km of about 40,000 people. Nonetheless, in the heady days of the Cold War and nuclear armament, <br/>\r\nit was deemed a tolerable risk for the scientists to be able to study reactions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith the hope of achieving a scientific breakthrough, the scientists at R1 decided to conduct an experiment on July 13, <br/>\r\n1954, at 18:59. They were attempting to generate a controlled nuclear fission reaction to produce more energy than what was put in. <br/>\r\nBut things went horribly wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the scientists activated the reactor, there was an eerie silence in the room. Then, suddenly, there was a loud buzzing sound, <br/>\r\nfollowed by a blinding flash of light that filled the room. The reactor was not behaving as they had expected. Instead of a controlled reaction, <br/>\r\nit was generating an uncontrollable chain reaction. The reactor began to overheat rapidly, and the control rods meant to control the reaction failed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe situation quickly spiraled out of control. The scientists tried to contain the situation, <br/>\r\nbut they were helpless against the overpowering force of nuclear energy. <br/>\r\nThe reactor exploded, sending a massive cloud of radioactive material into the air. <br/>\r\nThe scientists working at the site were caught in the explosion and were transformed into zombies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow, 50 years later, the science lab has been overrun by the zombie scientists. <br/>\r\nYour task is to clear out the lab and prevent the zombies from escaping. <br/>\r\nThe city has hired you as a professional zombie exterminator. <br/>\r\nArmed with only a gun, you enter the lab. The silence is deafening, <br/>\r\nand the eerie glow of the radiation reminds you of the tragedy that occurred here 50 years ago. <br/>\r\nYou cautiously make your way through the lab, searching for the zombies. <br/>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a growling sound. You ready your weapon and prepare for the worst.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-19T04:09:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f64/f64cc329222f880dd8ed928785d629dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isak Felldin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Sole Proprietor"], "esrb_rating": null}
