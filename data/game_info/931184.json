I published it early to collect your feedback and suggestions. How the development goes further depends on your feedback.\u00a0\u00a0Although development is far from finish, this demo has\u00a0a small completed story and can be completed to the end. Estimated time to beat the demo - 2hrs, and you can save the game in progress, to complete it later.</p>\n<p>The game is mostly a seated experience, although you may play it standing, but it could be less comfortable.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Your research expedition goes awry from the very beginning, you find yourself trapped in a small research submarine, far beneath the ocean's surface and deep within an underwater cave system. The claustrophobic confines of the sub feel oppressive, but at least you have shelter. Meanwhile, your buddy is trapped outside in a collapsed cave, their life is in danger.</p>\n<p>You must act quickly to save your colleague and to find a way out of these cursed caves.\u00a0Explore the remains of an abandoned Soviet research base, find clues from the outside using a remote controlled drone, and master submarine control to perfection.</p>\n<p>And you are not alone here, be careful not to awaken what has been sleeping for decades.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>- Immersive experience is in both senses, both literally and figuratively</p>\n<p>- A variety of instruments. You don't have any windows, but you're not blind. Use them to find a way out.</p>\n<p>- Detailed submarine that is not your enemy, but an ally. So don't hesitate, learn how it works and become a proficient\u00a0submariner</p>\n<p>- You cannot get out in diving suit, but it doesn't mean that you cannot interact with outsides. Use your trusty (and almost indestructible) ROV to recover and place objects in the caves.</p>\n\r\nHints and controls\r\n<p>Hold controller trigger button to grab items and to interact with instruments with an index finger. Some items have actions that can be triggered using\u00a0 a trigger button when held (I.e: ROV control stick, fire extinguisher)</p>\n<p>You can change movement type settings in start menu. Defaults are snap turns and teleports.</p>\n<p>If you're too overwhelmed with all these complicated devices onboard, start small -- figure out how to use Sonar and how to control movement of the submarine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beacons that recovered from underwater can be connected to the terminal. Connect them to the terminal using the plug by the side of the terminal.</p>\n<p>Map mode of the holographic projector can not only plot your trajectory, you can create path points there and move and link them by your hands. This can help you if you're lost.</p>\n<p>There's more help entries in the terminal.</p>\n\n<p>Supported languages: English, Russian. Language can be changed only in the main menu. English translation is far from perfect, so I will appreciate any help in translation.</p>\r\nSupported Platfoms\r\n<p>SteamVR (PC) - Tested on Pico, Oculus Quest and Lenovo Explorer WMR</p>\n<p>Oculus Quest 2/ Pico 4 Native APK -- with simpler visuals</p>\n<p>Non VR mode is not supported for now, unfortunately.</p>\r\nPC Hardware requirements\r\n<p>Should work any on PC that can smoothly run Beat Saber.</p>\n\r\nLinks:\r\n<p>https://discord.gg/GJdpm9PPUB\u00a0- Discord</p>\n<p>https://t.me/sibmakeshift\u00a0- Telegram Channel with devlogs (In russian)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T07:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03d/03d4fa4f507e805f608bb583f2897a56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 342, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Mehozavr"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
