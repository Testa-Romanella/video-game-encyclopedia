Give them some space to calm down and don't \r\nshoot them or near them, or they'll sue you.</li><li>Typos are \r\nvillainous, and will shoot you if you shoot near them. They are the only\r\n ones who will shoot at you without being damaged first.</li><li>Use cover, distance, dodging, and grit to stay alive! The words are not very smart, but they will outgun you if you go in guns-blazing and engage them at point-blank-range. Longer words can take more damage. </li><li>If you're unsure if a word has the right spelling, you can always pause the game (Escape key) and check it in a real dictionary. Here's the list of commonly misspelled words used in the game.</li><li>Each time you hit a word with your bullet (an exclamation mark), you damage one of its letters, turning it red. If all the letters in the word are damaged, then it dies.</li><li>You die if all of your 4 letters are damaged.</li><li>The day ends when you die (game over) or deliver all of the bounties.</li><li>Look on the bounties board by the sheriff's office to see how many outstanding bounties there are for the day.</li><li>Look on the town's welcome sign to see the current population.</li><li>If you end up with a negative balance even after delivering all of the bounties for the day, then you go out of business.</li><li>Minimize collateral damage - the costs can add up. Don't shoot innocent bystanders. Don't shoot walls. Every shot costs you one coin also.</li><li>Health care is not free. Each damaged letter of yours costs 50 coins for the doctor to patch you up before you move to the next town.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Third Party Assets</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Music</strong>: \"Spaghetti Western Theme - Orchestral\" by Markus Lindner (CC BY 4.0)</li><li><strong>Sound effects</strong>: \"Western Audio &amp; Music\" by John Leonard French (free from Unity Asset Store)</li><li><strong>Font</strong>: \"Bou Western Font\" by Bou Fonts</li><li><strong>Font:</strong> \"Bonzer - San Francisco\" by Bonzer</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity (2019.2.17f1), Gimp, Blender 2.79</p>\n<p>Thank you to Sebastian Standke (The Game Curator) for the amazingly skillful play through video!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-13T02:42:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/109/109afdd3f6d6a644a5bcff52ac7a6245.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andyman404"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
