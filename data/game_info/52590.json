The object of the game is to fill in boxes that have to be made by moving by its four corners. There is similarity to Pac-Man also. Instead of ghosts, spiders chase you while you are trying to complete your task ( tribesmen and pigs are the foes in Amidar).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b28aaea2a36f2cd6565cec7f0239179.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Atari 2600"], "developers": ["Froggo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["GameFAQs", "Froggo"], "esrb_rating": null}
