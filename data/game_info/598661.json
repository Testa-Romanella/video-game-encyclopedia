In Dis\\\\Chord, the player has the ability to approach combat encounters in a conventional hack-and-slash manner, or to switch into a rhythm game mode. While in the rhythm game, the player's character is taken over by an AI controller that acts on behalf of the player, with its performance in combat being directly connected to the player's performance in the rhythm game.</p>\n<p>As of right now, Dis\\\\Chord is just a technical demo intended to showcase this approach to game design, but it will be expanded and improved in the future provided that it receives enough positive feedback.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T08:46:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e91c171f2c9654609c79fd82da943af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dis\\\\Chord"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
