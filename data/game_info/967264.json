This game is my first release on Steam. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me via email! Thank you for your support!)<br/><br/>\"The Elder Goddess\" is an open-world RPG game that contains adult content. You will play as the recently revived goddess Aphrodite, exploring the world and regions, defeating enemies, solving various puzzles, and obtaining rewards from treasure chests.<h3>World and Civilization:</h3><br/>This world is created by two gods. One is the goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite, and the other is the chaotic and corrupt god, Balthos. As a result, the world contains both justice and evil, light and darkness. How long has it been since the creation? Life has evolved, forming different ethnicities and civilizations. However, balance is always disrupted. Balthos has spread corruption within most creatures, causing some to become mad and aggressive. People have suffered from these malevolent creatures, and the power of faith has awakened the goddess Aphrodite.<br/><br/>Goddess, you have finally awakened! Please restore balance to this world once again!<br/><h3>World and Civilizations:</h3><br/>This world is divided into three nations: the southern Illiat, the northern Anu Empire, and the distant Pachamama Archipelago.<br/><br/>Illiat: A nation that values freedom and worships the goddess Aphrodite, ruled by an organization called the Knight Academy. The Knight Academy was established to protect and uphold the faith of the goddess Aphrodite. The academy's principal is also the ruler of the entire nation, highly respected by all. However, becoming the ruler through elections is not an unreachable dream.<br/><br/>Anu Empire: A slave empire that, although once worshipped the goddess Aphrodite a long time ago, has grown suspicious of her powers for unknown reasons. The ruler of the Anu Empire, Anusis, believes that only absolute control can make everyone obey. Countless slaves exist within the empire, including sex slaves. These sex slaves often serve the royal family and sell their bodies for their masters' profit. Some sex slaves are even forced to participate in gladiatorial fights against powerful monsters.<br/><br/>Pachamama Archipelago: A mysterious land untouched by many adventurers. The archipelago is home to three powerful tribal factions: the Sun Tribe, Moon Tribe, and Star Tribe. While Pachamama Archipelago remains tribal in its civilization, they are closely connected with nature, and every member of the tribe is spiritually attuned. Legend has it that these three tribes guard the entrance where the gods descended and created the world, protecting the land day and night until variables appeared.<h3>World Exploration:</h3><br/>Aphrodite's Tower: In the world, there are ancient altars that have survived from more distant times. These altars are called Aphrodite's Towers. People are unclear about the origin and purpose of these towers, but they know they were built for the goddess.<br/><br/>As the goddess Aphrodite, players can instantly teleport from anywhere in the world to Aphrodite's Tower. However, you need to reach and activate Aphrodite's Tower to use its function.<br/><br/>Spells and Skills: Aphrodite's Tower can also offer various spells and skills, but you need to obtain a certain number of Goddess Crystals from advanced chests and make offerings to acquire spells and skills.
