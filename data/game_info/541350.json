It has many options which you can turn on or off depending on how challenging you want it to be.<br/><br/>Bowman is a highly addictive classical game. Even if you've never heard of it before, play it just once and you'll be hooked.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to shoot arrows at your opponent and kill them before they kill you. It's a battle against your opponent to see who can accurately judge the angle and strength of the shot to make the arrow land on your opponents body.<br/><br/>A head shot inflicts the most damage while a shot in the chest takes second place. Everywhere else on the opponents body inflicts less damage.<br/><br/>To shoot your bow, simply drag your finger across the screen and you'll be presented with a trajectory plus angle and strength (power) information. Release your finger to release the bow.<br/><br/>You can play Bowman against the iPhone or against a friend.<br/><br/>To make it even more entertaining, we have also included a bird shooting game. You'll have to shoot as many birds as you can within 3 minutes and then let your friend try the same. Hopefully, you will have shot more birds than your friend.<br/><br/>Thousands and thousands of people play Bowman online every day and now you can enjoy a better version of it on the iPhone.
