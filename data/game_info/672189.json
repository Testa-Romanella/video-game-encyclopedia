If your cavemen get too close to the Forest, River, Fire, or Cliff they could be killed by a dangerous unknown mystery. Use the trait card to the left to share knowledge with one of your cavemen at a time. Teach them to learn to avoid the dangers in the world by clicking the card and then clicking on one of the people. If your cavemen come in close proximity to one another they will share their knowledge. Win by keeping 2 or more of your cavemen alive.</p>\n\n<p>Garry Stanfill - garry.stanfill@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Raystani Enock De Oliveria -\u00a0raystani161@hotmail.com</p>\n<p>Pasindu De Silva -\u00a0spiritcrusherstudios@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Jon Mattarocchia -\u00a0Jmattarock@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Arvatrix - Wolfgang Kadau - wkadau@gmx.net</p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>09/27/2021 - </strong>Fixed missing reference bug that caused upgrades to not work properly in builds only.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T09:03:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b20/b20e297130646dc4dae8f9ed238f24c1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MTDev"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
