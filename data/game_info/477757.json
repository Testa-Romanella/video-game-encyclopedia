Have fun, the 8th level is kinda tough but doable. The cube likes to fly, which is not a bug but a feature, adds some surprise mechanics. I won't ask for donations, but if you do donate then that'd be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>The Web version does not work perfectly, you might have to fullscreen it to get the resolution working, and the physics are a little weird.</p>\n<p>WEB VERSION:\u00a0https://itch.io/embed-upload/2583277?color=6f6f6f</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T04:15:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/011/011dac6abcfb3473734a0dfa4b78aaed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Carl0011"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
