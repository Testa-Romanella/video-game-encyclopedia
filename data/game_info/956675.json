{"id": 956675, "slug": "enid", "name": "Enid", "name_original": "Enid", "description": "Enid is a \u00be perspective, single-player RPG with a retro feel, wherein the player collects objects and completes tasks for their fantastical friend - an anthropomorphic fire named Enid! The core gameplay hearkens back to a nostalgic era, drawing inspiration from classic games (as well as newer indie titles) like Harvest Moon, Pikmin, Stardew Valley, Celeste, and A Short Hike. Imagine a laid-back, lo-fi exploration RPG where the player takes care of their new pal, who reveals bits and pieces of a grander and secret narrative as they help one another move forward - all this in tightly packaged, easy to play minigames! Above all, Enid is a game about exploring, collecting, solving, and progressing through manageable, bite-sized chunks of gameplay and story!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-28T05:28:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/970/970962aca29cb245813cd6a244e034d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ember's Embrace", "Firekeepers"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ember's Embrace"], "esrb_rating": null}
