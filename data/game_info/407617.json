You're in a band and they\u2019re about to go on tour. It's your job to schedule the band's stops over your 100-day tour, visiting as many states as possible.<br/><br/>Each turn in On Tour, two ten-sided dice are rolled to make two two-digit numbers. For example, a roll of 3 and 7 creates the numbers 37 and 73. All players write each of those numbers in a state on their map. The regions they can write in are restricted by three cards turned up in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player draws a route on their map, starting with a low number and visiting adjacent states with higher and higher numbers. Players get a point for every state they visit.<br/><br/>There are also some bonus points available, a way to get wilds, and a variable set-up step that makes every game different.<br/><br/>Solo play only. Compete to beat your previous high scores.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:16:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ed/7eda352c793566e5eada2b818c2b15a3_LTIHL14.jpg", "website": "https://www.boardgametables.com/pages/on-tour-app", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 160, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["BoardGameTables.com"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": ["902a"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
