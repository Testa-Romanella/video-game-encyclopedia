In campaign mode, u need to pass levels and collect coins, whereas in survival mode, you need to pass the levels consecutively failing to which you will have to play the game again from level 1. But you have another feature in survival to send your score to the leader-board which will compare you from other players of the game. And for passing each level you have to click various spots. Each click counts one move. The level has to be completed in <strong>limited</strong> moves after dodging the obstacles in the way likes ball, platforms, etc. Also there are portals which will, well, transport you from its Starting point to its Ending point.<br/></p>\n<p>This was made purely in python with a game library known as <strong>pygame</strong> and a physics engine called <strong>pymunk.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This was inspired by <strong>TWT</strong>'s \"<strong>Super Mini-Golf</strong>\" but it's quite different in mechanism from that. <br/></p>\n<p>This was made as a fun project without any investment, but it took much time, effort and patience to make this possible.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits :\u00a0<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lakshya</li><li>Aditya Nandan (nick: !MAD!)</li><li>Vatsal</li><li>Vanya</li><li>Chetan Pande</li><li>Partible</li><li>Sushant</li><li>And all the Beta-testers who helped us to take important decisions :)</li></ul>\n<p>If you wanna contact us u can join our Discord :- https://discord.gg/A9uuUXm9nG<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:18:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56b/56b2b419a6a17e5000722b7ffaad50b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Monzter-Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
