You are not sure.<br/></p>\n<p>While on your journey you notice a large amount of asteroids navigating towards you. They seem drawn to you, as if your fleet is acting like a magnetic force, attracting the asteroids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dodge the asteroids and collect the remains that drop after two asteroids collide. You might even use the magnetism of your fleet to your advantage and make the asteroids collide with each other. Some of the asteroids drop some kind of fuel that lets you activate a special effect of your fleet: manipulate the force field of your ship and make more asteroids collide with each other or push asteroids away from your fleet.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use <em>wasd </em>or your <em>arrow-keys</em> to navigate your fleet</li><li>Use <em>spacebar </em>to temporarily boost the speed of your fleet</li><li>Use <em>shift </em>to manipulate the force field of your fleet after collecting the special fuel from colliding asteroids</li></ul>\n<p>Made in collaboration with\u00a0https://mintchi.itch.io</p>\n<p><strong>Used Assets</strong></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/beautiful-progress-bar-free-1...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/primitive-plus-25542</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/gui-audio-package-164401</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/ultra-sci-fi-game-a...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/gui-kit-neon-38123</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/sherbb-s-particle-collection...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/snap...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/sc-fi-music-214312<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T21:48:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/468/46899bd643651505d23e60973f72e933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Wigglehead", "mintchi"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
