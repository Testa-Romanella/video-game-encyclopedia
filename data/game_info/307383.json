{"id": 307383, "slug": "orion-the-alien-wars", "name": "Orion The Alien Wars", "name_original": "Orion The Alien Wars", "description": "Orion The Alien Wars is a side-scrolling SHMUP resembling titles in the arcade era. Foreign galaxies are in conflict between Alien invaders and rebel fighters. Your ship may be a junker, but with stolen alien power cells and skillful maneuvers, you will upgrade your star-fighter into a terrifying ace flyer! Collect power cells, predict and eliminate enemy formations, and rock to our lovingly-crafted techno soundtrack in Classic AND Endless modes!<br/><br/>\tWe\u2019ve approached gameplay design with arcade space shooters in mind, taking the best from the best within our particular style. Interface and gameplay experience are simple and clean. Immersive design sucks a player in and closes down outside distractions. Orion offers multiple gameplay experiences with two modes; Classic mode requires patience, memory, and skill in equal measure throughout the different galaxies. Endless mode, on the other hand, offers a very fast game that is tough-as-nails. Mission : Survive the onslaught of homing droids!<br/><br/>\tFuture development for Orion The Alien Wars will be adjusted if the game gets supported and is well received by fans. Possible updates would include:<br/><br/>\u2218  Additional galaxies will be added to Classic mode. As the game currently stands, there are only 3, but we want to put multiple additional worlds to make Orion The Alien Wars a large, artistically powerful game. Each new galaxy will experience a major aesthetic redesign compared to previous worlds to reward dedicated and skilled players with beautiful new content. Elegant particles, expressive environments and enemies, and a rehaul to aesthetic design will accompany each new \u201cgalaxy\u201d or world. Artistic flair to light and atmosphere will breathe life into the new galaxies!<br/><br/>\u2218  A diverse cast of aliens, environments, and Kaiju monsters will challenge players in new ways to make these additional worlds mechanically unique. Each new world will be given a unique theme that represents these new challenges and difficult-to-master enemies.<br/>In addition to new galaxies and worlds, old worlds will be touched up and improved upon visually in a graceful style players have been accustomed to.<br/><br/>\u2218  Achievements and Game Center functionality.<br/><br/>\u2218  Classic and Endless mode will have a Leaderboard so players can compare their score to the best fighter pilots in the galaxy!<br/><br/>\u2218  Skill-locked (progress related) achievements which reward a player with new fighter pilots with unique abilities and talents to offer a wider range of tactical styles. When unlocked, the new ships are: Junkyard Bomber, Academy Ace, &amp; Rebel Alien Fighter!<br/><br/>\tFUTURE UPDATES could include other designs, but these are our primary concerns to deliver a powerful experience in Orion The Alien Wars.
