To give everyone some context, I did not develop this game but it was found inside a thumbdrive that was handed to me. A cryptic man dress in a black suit wearing a fedora passed me this game via a thumbdrive while I was waiting to catch my bus. He also said, \u201cBeware of what you see, as it may not be all as it seems. Tales travel far and wide, but may not be the truth you seek.\u201d He left quickly after dumping the thumbdrive onto me before I could hand it back to him. \r\n  </p>\n\n<p>Thinking the thumbdrive could contain some suspicious virus, I dump it in the corner of my shelf for several years. It wasn\u2019t until recently that I stumbled onto it again, I immediately prop it into my computer thinking it was a thumbdrive I used to own. Since no virus is detected while I was trying this fun game, I thought why not just share it with everyone? So here you have it, a fun and cute game for everyone to enjoy. Thanks for playing and hope you have a great time playing \u233e\u25a1/\u25a3\u22a0.\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T04:29:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee0/ee08568b8a67e69dd2b96a0c47d8617e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ZetoArrow"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
