Instead, your <strong><em>energy source</em></strong> provides a limited supply of power, which allows you to keep only a certain amount of defenses active at a time. Your job is to toggle defenses on and off, depending on the situation.</p>\n\r\nEnemies\r\n\n<p>Your base will be constantly assaulted by an endless wave of enemies, trying to get to your core. You lose if your core gets destroyed. You can't win, unfortunately, but you accumulate score over time. Your score accumulates faster when your core is healthy.</p>\n<p>Enemies spawn at fixed locations and head straight towards the core. Over time, depending on your actions, enemies will re-adjust their path, and will keep looking for new approaches until the end of the game.</p>\n<p>Your defenses and background objects can not be traversed by enemies, which forces the enemy to funnel into several choke points.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Inactive turrets don't shoot. Click on a turret to toggle its state. Inactive turret will become active, unless there's no more energy available. In which case, deactivate other turrets first. Press <z> to deactivate all towers at once.</z></p>\n<p>Camera can be moved by edge-scrolling, or with <w>, <a>, <s>, <d> keys. Press and hold <shift> to increase camera move speed.
