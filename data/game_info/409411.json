Your goal is to help your creature dominate the nature by giving it proper features that will give it an edge over its opponent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a project in development. I have been developing it for a month and I am having fun doing it. I hope you will have fun too.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD for camera movement</li><li>Q and E for camera rotation</li><li>Mouse scroll for camera zoom</li></ul>\n<p>Hint: Try to keep your energy cost as low as possible.
