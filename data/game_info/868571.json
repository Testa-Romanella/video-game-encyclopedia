I decided to start with Asteroids, figuring it would be a fairly simple port. It was actually more complex than I thought. I think I've managed to replicate the feel of the original game, but I wouldn't be surprised if I've missed a thing or two - I was never the best at this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Feedback would be appreciated,\r\nThank you!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T09:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f022a535da079e9377d973abb5d6d59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aquasition"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
