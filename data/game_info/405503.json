{"id": 405503, "slug": "super-ultra-ninja-pig", "name": "Super Ultra Ninja Pig", "name_original": "Super Ultra Ninja Pig", "description": "<p><strong>Super Ultra Ninja Pig</strong> is a fast-paced action game with bullet hell elements where each blow struck against you makes you more powerful!</p>\n<p>You play as a pig (unsurprisingly) who gained super-intelligence from radiation after a nuclear war. Your whole pig family died in the war, leaving you with only revenge in your heart. You strap on a ninja mask and become the Ninja Pig,\u00a0freedom fighter against the evil people who left the world in desolation (who are also pigs, for some reason).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>In this game, you have access to a variety of weapons, but only one is available at a time. When you get hit, you attain a new, more powerful weapon.\u00a0You also have, in addition to your main weapon, a trusty sword. You must be close to the enemy in order to hit them with it, but it is incredibly powerful. It is also useful for dealing with the large amounts of bullets, as a swing of the sword can remove the bullets in your way. This is a score-based game, where high skill (killing with your sword or a less powerful weapon) is rewarded.</p>\n<p>How many evil pigs can you kill before you give in to their bullets?</p>\n<p>Controls (mouse and keyboard required):<br/></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD</strong> to move</li><li><strong>Move the mouse</strong> to aim</li><li><strong>Left click\u00a0</strong>to shoot your main weapon</li><li><strong>Right click\u00a0</strong>to swing your sword</li><li><strong>Escape\u00a0</strong>to pause</li></ul>\n<p>(This is my first game on here, feedback is much appreciated! I hope you enjoy the game!)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:55:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8af/8af0fc33e58c6d1044fb5fb35348856f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["BrocEdson"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
