Still bugs to squish so feel free to comment them.\u00a0<br/><br/>Notes:\u00a0<br/>- At the moment it will feel very Portal-esque, especially due to the voice. This all actually happened by accident on basing it off two or three completely separate ideas. Future version have more of a 'Zapp Brannigan style' voice-over.<br/>- Let me know your thoughts, bugs, critiques, etc. But be nice...I'm kidding, this is the internet, you be you boo boo.\u00a0<br/><br/>- Controls are in the 'Story Mode' but for the lazy/motivated:<br/>\u00a0WASD = move, Spacebar = Jump, MiddleMouseButton/E = pick up object, F = throw picked up object if possible, RightClick = aim time particles, LeftClick = activate time particles / switch, C = freeze time, Hold R = reverse time, ScrollWheel = change time manipulation speed,\u00a0LeftShift = speed up/slow down time, RightCTRL/RightALT = change background music, 0 = restart level, K = enter/exit ghost mode (ghost mode allows you to fly through walls and outside the level - only exists in alpha due to potential unforeseeable bugs.)<br/><br/>Current BugLog:<br/>\u00a0- Levels needs to be more streamlined and some levels need to be combined as they don't deserve to be entirely separate levels.\u00a0<br/>- Level select actually only goes up to level 25. If you select further than that, it will return you to the main menu/take you to your previous level. I do know this, and it is an easy fix. One day I will fix it.\u00a0<br/>- Beginning of story feels way too much like a tutorial and could be done a lot better.\u00a0<br/></p><p>- Currently a side-project, not main focus.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-06T02:49:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6af/6afcad9aa40d83645f066f5e65941181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["joeldizzle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
