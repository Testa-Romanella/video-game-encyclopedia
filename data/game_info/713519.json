By defeating enemies, the player will gain experience; upon leveling up, they can choose to upgrade one of their attributes (health, attack power, or magic.) They will also find new items and equipment that will make them more powerful and grant new abilities (bombs blow up certain walls, magic bolts activate buttons and hit enemies, etc.), additionally being able to buy items from shops using money reaped from defeated enemies, cutting plants, destroying boxes, and breaking vases. The player can bring up a map at any time, which keeps track of their location and the areas they have already visited; they will also find portals that will allow them to quickly backtrack to previous areas.</p>\n<p>Thank You\u00a0</p>\n<p>Akshat Singh (20BCG10017)</p>\n<p>Badal Singh (20BCG10120)</p>\n<p>Suryansh Mishra (20BCG10050)</p>\n<p>Shri\u00a0Harshita (20BCG10061)</p>\n<p><strong>Game Physics\u00a0 (Shriram Sir)</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-24T09:50:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e80/e8094e7eda4e099ab9c59bc7d2084836.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CallmeAkStark"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
