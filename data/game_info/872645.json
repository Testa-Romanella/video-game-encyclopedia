Knowing this is coming Alice has prepared a spell that can mass produce a lot of sweets efficiently... to efficiently. Apparently there seems to be\u00a0 a malfunction on the spell and now it can't stop generating candy. While this is happening there are a lot of visitors came to her house as well. Ghost and Goblins... not the patient type. With that Alice might as well kill\u00a0 birds in one stone, by serving the never ending candy supplies to her visitors while making sure the candy does not pile up too much. As always it's Shanghai who is the one doing all of the dirty work.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Z: grab item into your inventory\r\n</li><li>X: serve customers when applicable\r\n</li><li>A; switch target customer to serve when applicable\r\n</li><li>C:\u00a0hold to trash your inventory\r\n</li><li>Space: force a row of blocks to drop\r\n</li><li>left/ right: move around, you'll loop around the boundary\r\n</li></ul>\n\r\nRules and Mechanics:\r\n<ul><li>Press Z to grab blocks from the bottom row of the board.</li><li>Blocks will be stored in your inventory, you only have limited amount of space so be mindful of what you grab.</li><li>3 of the same colored blocks will be combined to a tier 2 blocks, this can help reducing your block count.</li><li>If your inventory is full, you can simply recycle them by holding the C key, however it takes time and it puts all your blocks in your inventory back to the board as tier 1 blocks.</li><li>Orders are on the right, to serve them first you need to have the require blocks in your inventory, then press X to serve. you will serve your entire inventory.</li><li>If you have more than one orders you can serve (valid orders have a green check-mark to highlight it), you can press A to switch your target customer to serve.\u00a0</li><li>Once an order is served, you will gain points and that order is refreshed. excess blocks served will be converted into bonus points.</li><li>When you completed an order, your combo goes up which multiplies your score.
