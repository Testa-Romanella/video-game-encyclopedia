The rulebook contains a guide to gameplay with an explanation of the GUI. <br/></p>\n<p>I originally designed this game with two players in mind, but I refactored it to make it possible for one player to play against a basic AI I designed for this project. <br/></p>\n<p>Graphics and sounds used are public domain. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54d/54d3f07bcf627f64e601992ca3dc7ffd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nonamethe2"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
