For unusual interactions, it had to be something you don't see often or a lot in games, hence the reference of Warioware-esque microgames comes into play. Often weird and strange, but quick and easy to play, they allowed for a lot of creativity. For my game, I used the example of a Bee, flying around, collecting pollen and going back to the hive after they got all three flowers. Bees aren't in a lot of games, nor is their job in games either.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Use the mouse to move around and collect pollen from all three flowers (go over them) and then return to the hive! You have 5 seconds!</p>\n\n<p>Art all done by me.</p>\n<p>Used:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://answers.unity.com/questions/1076409/how-to-make-a-game-object-follow-the...\u00a0for knowledge on how to get the bee to follow the mouse.
