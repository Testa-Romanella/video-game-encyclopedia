The value of those trick cards are added to each player's total score.<br/><br/>Whoever is dealt the 2 of clubs plays this card to start. Each player must play one card in a clockwise order, following suit where they can. The winner of each trick is the player who plays the highest card matching the suit of the first player to play. If you cannot follow suit you can play any card from your hand, except on the first round you are not permitted to play a trick card. No player may lead with a heart until the first heart is played ('hearts are broken').<br/><br/>Want a quicker game? A new game mode of 'small hearts' has been added! Small Hearts is a quicker 28 card version, where the 2-7 of each suit is removed from the deck before playing. It plays the same way as Classic Hearts, but the Q of spades is worth 7 points, shooting the moon gives 14 points to each opposition player, the starting card is the 8 of clubs and the game ends when the first player goes over 50 not 100 points.<br/><br/>This classic game is also know as Black Lady, Dark Lady, Slippery Anne, Chase the Lady, Crubs, Black Queen and Black Maria.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd9/cd90345e51c86674cbcd3ba1551116d1_JKjvZqM.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Kevin Ainley-Walker"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Kevin Ainley-Walker"], "esrb_rating": null}
