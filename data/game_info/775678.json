Ofc you want to stop them from stopping you right? The way you do that is by getting close to them whilst being chased by one of their airplanes, the airplane will then kill it for you. But what if it has legs? Well everyone knows tanks with legs don't shoot airplanes, but they are allergic to cake. You can pick cake up by pressing E.</p>\n<p>As everyone knows paper airplanes are faster than you, so how do you make sure it doesn't catch up with you? By pressing left-shift to roll and increase your speed by 1.5 whilst doing the roll.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T11:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8a4/8a4f0682d24905e5240283cf7dd4010c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["slobbymonk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
