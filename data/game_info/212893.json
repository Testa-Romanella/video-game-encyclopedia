Here's a reference, though:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to Move, Mouse to Look</li><li>Space to Jump</li><li><strong>Hold SHIFT if you find yourself bouncing off walls too much.</strong> Shift will cancel momentum in the direction of a wall and allow you to slide along the wall.\r\n</li><li>If you're near metal, press space to land if it doesn't automatically do it.</li></ul>\n<p>This was a concept I had thought on previously, when reading Ender's Game. I always thought \"up\" or \"down\"\u00a0being relative\u00a0was an interesting concept for a first person game.</p>\n<p>While I was coming up with what I was going to do for the GMTK Jam's theme of \"Genre without Mechanic\", I eventually got onto the permutation \"Platformer without Gravity\" and was reminded of this game concept. This was the first time I actually put my idea into code and levels, and I'm honestly surprised how far I managed to get in that time, seeing as I've never done anything serious with Unity before. (I still have no idea how multiple scenes work.)</p>\n<p>If I had another day to work on this, I'd try to reach my goal of 10 levels; right now there is only 4. I'd also actually try to unload or disable levels as you walked through the\u00a0connecting hallways. And I'd light and texture the levels properly. Also sound: I wanted to have footfalls on metal as you walked around or landed, to convey that the player character has magnetic boots on, which is how they can walk around in zero-g, but finding a sound I could actually download and use proved difficult in the limited time span of the jam.<br/></p>\n<p>The following are after-deadline builds of the game. The only change is that the lighting has been re-baked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Windows Build\u00a0|\u00a0Mac Build |\u00a0Linux Build<br/></p>\n<p>The Mac Build has been tested, but if it doesn't work for some reason, make sure the executable inside the app contents\u00a0has the proper permissions. The Linux Build has not been tested.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edb/edb9e6fc457c9fefa12c1cc72dd2e7b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tustin2121"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
