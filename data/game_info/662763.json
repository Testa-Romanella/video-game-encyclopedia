{"id": 662763, "slug": "big-truck", "name": "Big Truck", "name_original": "Big Truck", "description": "<p>Big Truck is a simple, but very fun to play game. You just have to drive a truck across rough terrain and make sure that your goods get to the destination safely. You will get a precise number of goods you carry and a precise number of goods that is required. The more you bring, the more score and coins you get. This game is all about being careful. At the beginning of each round, a precise number of goods will be dropped into your container. You have to touch the right of the screen for accelerating, the left of the screen for slowing down and tilt the device for balancing the truck. On the top side of the screen, you will find a timer and the goods count in your container and level required. You have to find the perfect balance between reaching the end of the level rapidly and doing so without dropping too many goods. The only way you can lose is if you don\u2019t transport enough goods or if you manage to turn the truck upside down. In this case, you will have to retry.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-10T04:55:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f56fce42f6f64e21dd79ef5867e2c72a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["3g60"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
