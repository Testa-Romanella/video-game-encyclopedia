The goal of the game is to stop as many children from leaving the school by throwing books at them to bring them back. There are currently three books that can be thrown. When a child is hit with a book, one random quote from the book is written, to show the child is reading the book.<br/></p>\n<p>In some sense, the game is a tower defense style because of the single tower with waves of children to stop/help. </p>\n<p>Expansion of the project may include:</p>\n<ul><li>Children Types - smaller, faster, and animations</li><li>Book Types - the books can affect the children, such as slowing them down, pulling in other children, splitting into smaller books.</li><li>Book Selection - With more types of books, you would want to plan out your repertoire of books by choosing your best or by providing a variety of types</li><li>Favorite Book(s) - some children have favorite books or their favorite genre. If you can get a child to read their favorite type of book, then you can earn some bonus or effect.</li></ul>\n<p>The game is created using the libGDX Java framework along with Box2D as the physics and collision system and Ashley as the entity management system.<br/><br/>Programming/Art: Exovum</p>\n<p>Music: My Brother</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b3551fe18b98a374368108310b1200.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Exovum"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
