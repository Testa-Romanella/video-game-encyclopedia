While the mechanics are fairly set-in-stone throughout the course, the art and music, as well as balance choices are greatly varied. I hope you enjoy my first attempt at making a game.<br/><br/>Controls:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Left and Right Arrow keys or 'A' and 'D' to move left and right.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Cursor to navigate menu and end screen.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -Spacebar to dash</p>\n\n<p>I do hope to use this game as a reference when making new games, and also as a experimental workspace when I want to try new ideas. So expect updates!\u00a0 I\u00a0think the first project I'll tackle is adding a score counter in the top right of the screen, or perhaps a timer.\u00a0 Until then, thanks for reading about my game.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n<p>Brazilian Street Fight by Punch Deck | https://soundcloud.com/punch-deck<br/>Music promoted by https://www.chosic.com<br/>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<br/>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T07:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/509/509c8b2aaf1e532af8d481e8b3a1c617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thxrst"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
