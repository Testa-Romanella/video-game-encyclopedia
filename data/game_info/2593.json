{"id": 2593, "slug": "adventure-xpress", "name": "Adventure Xpress", "name_original": "Adventure Xpress", "description": "Adult Swim and PikPok, makers of Robot Unicorn Attack 2 and Giant Boulder of Death bring you their biggest game yet!<br/><br/>\u2022 A new twist on Match-3 gameplay - Equip weapons, armor, and spells to personalize your strategy against foes. Match three or more runes to attack.<br/>\u2022 A huge journey - As part of the Adventure Xpress you&amp;#39;ll travel to over 275 battle locations across a sprawling world map.<br/>\u2022 Heartwarming stories - If you\u2019re risking your life as a courier man or woman to deliver these letters you should at least get to read them, right?<br/><br/>Now, if that isn\u2019t enough to sell you - here are some more details:<br/><br/>THE BASICS (in case you\u2019re unfamiliar)<br/><br/>- Match runes to attack - three or more horizontally or vertically will charge up your weapon\u2019s attack and strike when your turn is over.<br/>- Match four or more to make special runes that when matched will clear even MORE. <br/>- Chain reactions and combos will hit for more damage. <br/><br/>THE TWISTS (bet you didn\u2019t think of these!)<br/><br/>At each location you\u2019ll encounter multiple enemies. You keep the same rune board and spell power throughout, so as you match you can strategize your plan against later enemies or final boss characters of each location. Vanquish them all and receive the spoils of coins, potions or stamps to upgrade your weapons, armor, and spells.<br/><br/>- Each weapon\u2019s stats impact how much it will hit and the number of runes you need to match to activate a Critical in your next turn. <br/>- Some weapons will even regenerate health for matching certain rune types!<br/>- The rune\u2019s elemental type determines its strength against the enemy.<br/>- Unlike other Match-3 games, each move doesn\u2019t have to be a match so you can strategize combos (though each time you make a move with no match, your enemy gets a free attack on you).<br/>- Request boosts from friends or spend premium currency to tip the scales further in your favor.<br/><br/>THE FEATURE LIST (download it already!)<br/><br/>\u2022 Over 275 battle locations over a huge game map<br/>\u2022 Battle over 30 types of enemies<br/>\u2022 Play as a male or female courier<br/>\u2022 Equip 20 types of weapons and 10 types of armor, both with multiple quality and element enchantments<br/>\u2022 5 elemental spells to learn, upgrade and unleash on your foes<br/>\u2022 Connect with friends to boost your stats and smite enemies<br/>\u2022 Game Center Achievements<br/>\u2022 How have you still not put this on your device?<br/><br/>Follow Us: <br/>Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/adultswimgames ;<br/>Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/adultswimgames ;<br/>Our Website - http://www.games.adultswim.com ;", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1bb/1bba276fce3b80c717a6e6b1eb3e8da2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 195, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["[adult swim]", "[adult swim] games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Turner Broadcasting System"], "esrb_rating": null}
