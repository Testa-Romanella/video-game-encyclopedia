The player explores the world from the perspective of the demon and unveils the mysteries that are hidden on the earth.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nCrystal of Light is a classical visual novel that is created using an open-source visual novel engine: Ren\u2019py.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wanted to create a short visual novel that has\u00a0middle-age fantasy setup that I am familiar with from many RPGs such as\u00a0<em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, Blizzard\u2019s\u00a0<em>Diablo</em>\u00a0series, and other similar titles. The major difference from those settings,\u00a0I wanted to make was deciding to put the player on the demon\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is quite self explanatory.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p><p>Thanks for the awesome music pack\u00a0fulminisictus!</p><p>https://fulminisictus.itch.io/visual-novel-audio-pack<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T06:43:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c5/8c5794d823fbed918ae0e251857f4e88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 188, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nimphia"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
