Try to keep your distance from the enemies, so they don't land on your spot and send you back. You can't jump over your own pieces in the goal, so always push them forward if you can. \u00a0If your selected piece can't go in (it has to land perfectly) it will do nothing. Don't send the enemy pieces from their start back in front of their goal.</p>\r\nTools used\r\n<p>Unity, Blender, Audacity, Photoshop, paint.net, procreate<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T16:35:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/360/3609ced17282a92ce0790e81676cdf7a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Jongs"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
