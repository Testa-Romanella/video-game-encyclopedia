{"id": 933230, "slug": "scanxiety-vr", "name": "Scanxiety VR", "name_original": "Scanxiety VR", "description": "<p>Scanxiety VR is a VR project that helps young children overcome their fear of scans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The application aims to help children who have to undergo an MRI scan by\u00a0making them experience a fantastic adventure within the same machine.</p>\n<p>Initially, the child will be guided around a hospital by Jane, a nurse who will explain to the player what an MRI scan is and how it works. The child will then go in a lift, that will take them to a secret level of the Hospital. Aster the robot, Jane the nurse and Peter the radiographer will explain to the player that they have been chosen to complete a mission that will save the Earth. The player will then lie in the scanner, that will then transform into a capsule and be launched into space. The player will have to destroy asteroids that are approaching the Earth. Once the mission is completed, the player will receive a certificate with the pictures of the\u00a0scans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During scans, children often feel claustrophobic. This VR project enables children to experience the close environment of a MRI scanner, but in a fantastic world where they will live an entertaining adventure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scanners may also scare young children because of the loud noises they produce. This is why we chose to give a fantastic meaning to those sounds that become part of the story.<br/></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>This demo project was created within the Virtual Reality course of the Cinema and Media Engineering faculty (a.y. 2021/2022).</p>\n<p>Politecnico di Torino.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers</strong></p>\n<p>Mattia Ambrosini<br/></p>\n<p>Gabriele Monteleone</p>\n<p>Andrea Spanu</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Caroline Storer</p>\n<p>Adriano Valentini</p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Game Engine - Unity Engine</p>\n<p>Unity Assets:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/skybox-series-fr...</p>\n<p>3D modelling tools - Blender</p>\n<p>3D models - CGTrader, Turbosquid, Sketchfab</p>\n<p>Animations - Mixamo</p>\n<p>Textures -\u00a0 Poliigon</p>\n<p>Sounds - FreeSound</p>\n<p>Characters -\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/jammo-character-mix-and-jam-...</p>\n\n\n<p>HOSPITAL</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em></p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/distillation-montage-ae700bdeaf034da980b4fac31fa...</p>\n<p>https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/furniture/chair/3-seater-waiting-chair</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/server-rack-62f6779cb7e448b19aaf58544c3c7218</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/elevator-66c70720afad406cb1f4f47e93e5e248</p>\n<p>https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sci-fi-biolab-corridor-023906576a3640beaf38f9954...<br/></p>\n\n<p>SPACE</p>\n<p><em>Features</em></p>\n<p>Cinemachine</p>\n<p>https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine</p>\n<p>Input System</p>\n<p>https://unity.com/features/input-system</p>\n\n<p><em>Assets</em></p>\n<p>Deep Space Skybox</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/deep-space-skybox-pa...</p>\n<p>Planet Earth</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/planet-earth-free-2...</p>\n<p>Asteroids</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/asteroids-pack-84988</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T08:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6be/6be031e46f5df8417d6f22f3c4de1529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scanxiety"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
