This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.<br/><br/>The game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.<br/><br/>Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won\u2019t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it\u2019s game over, and you\u2019ll have to start over again.<br/><br/>Challenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram\u2019s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/>\u25cf    Easy to learn, and fun to master gameplay<br/>\u25cf    Challenge your friend\u2019s high scores, challenge the world<br/>\u25cf    Fun, colorful and engaging graphics<br/>\u25cf    Exciting and addictive<br/>\u25cf    Fun four hours, or just a few minutes", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-29T10:58:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1dd/1dd0d6d4fc84324f0b4bfbac7112473b.jpg", "website": "http://sixga.me", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["Gram Games"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Casual", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Gram Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
