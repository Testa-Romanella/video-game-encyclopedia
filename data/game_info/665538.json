Other headsets should be supported, but I've not been able to test the game to verify this. If you run the game on another headset please let me know of any issues you run into &amp; I will do my best to fix them (and if it just works<strong>\u2122</strong> let me know so that I can update this description!).<br/></p>\n<p>The game is under active development and feedback is very welcome!
