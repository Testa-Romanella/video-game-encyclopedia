There was a lined sheet of paper, a sticked in a desk pin with a pen instead of the pointer and cut sheet stack as money and stocks. Time runs merrily and recklessly in a good group of friends. I hope you enjoy this funny game too. The rules are very simple.  Just twist the pointer and hope you get luck. Sue, Mike and Mr. Balder are playing against you. However, you can call them as you wish. Each player gets 1000 and a stock of one of four companies: car's, ship's, aviation's and space's. If you lose all money, you will not lose the game! The bank buys your stock for 500 at once. If you have no luck and you have only 100,  you will be tap button  \u201crob the bank\u201d.  It\u2019s impossible to lose this game. Ever win increases your capital and this success will be reflected in the game center, in the rating of Rich and Lucky. I wish you luck in this game and in your life.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a8/7a8fbc87611efd5a901ed07df4b248b7_CNfB7IS.jpg", "website": "http://machine-game.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Alexandr Seregin"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Board Games"], "publishers": ["Alexandr Seregin"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
