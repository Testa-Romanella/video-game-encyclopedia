{"id": 461489, "slug": "runner-p", "name": "Runner P", "name_original": "Runner P", "description": "<p>A simple endless runner that was inspired by an award winning movie I enjoyed watching. Jump and shoot projectiles to avoid or destroy enemies. Collect stones to buy abilities in the store. The longer you run, the faster you'll go.</p>\n<p>When the lockdown was enacted, about 4 months ago, I decided to use that time to learn how to use the Unreal Engine. I thought the best way for me to learn was to first follow a tutorial on how to make a (relatively) simple endless runner type game. Instead of making a clone of the game from the tutorial, I thought it would be another great learning experience to learn how to make a more personalized game.</p>\n<p>To make sure I wasn't stuck in a limbo of chasing perfection, I gave myself a deadline (end of June)\u00a0and compiled a plan on what I kind of endless runner I could make in that time frame. I learned very quickly that scope was a very important thing to keep in mind when restricted to a finite amount of time; there were a lot of things I had to cut out from my original concept of the game. Regardless of this game being more of a prototype/proof of concept, I'm still very proud that we were able to complete our goal with a couple days to spare. Oh right, I wasn't the only one that worked on this game.\u00a0My good friend\u00a0Huy, an amazing concept designer/ illustrator, made the assets and\u00a0designed the UI.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-03T05:36:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2cd75c5169e3138b45385740733a740.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MisguidedGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
