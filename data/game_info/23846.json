Join the exploits of two gritty detectives whose \n      sense of justice and raw instinct drive them to seek the truth. Put your \n      sleuthing skills to the challenge by re-investigating old crime scenes \n      and solving cold cases by searching for clues and interrogating perps! \n      Find leads by diving head first into old investigation notes, crime \n      scene photos and eye witness reports as you put together all the pieces. \n      Once you have a solid lead, interrogate persons of interest to see what \n      they do (or don't) know. Grill perps by asking tough questions, but be \n      careful! Ask the wrong questions and your Interrogation Gauge will \n      deplete. Ask too many wrong questions and it's Game Over!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:37:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d80/d80fcba7747ba2991ffdefffae8fb29a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 1, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS"], "developers": ["Aksys Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Aksys Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
