You have to dodge asteroids, rocks and vegetation while picking up energy cells to stay alive and keep flying! Your fuel slowly trickles out and if you don't pick up enough cells, your ship will come crashing down! But be careful: having too much fuel speeds you up, which makes it harder to dodge everything! After you eventually die, you get a highscore based on the time you survived. Can you beat your previous highscore?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22ad251e866437f618093128151f1e98.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garzec"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
