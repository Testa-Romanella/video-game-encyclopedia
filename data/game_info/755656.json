Touching an enemy makes you losse score, and the more you last running, the more bonus points. Avoid rocks, pits and walls. And try to get the top score so you can input your initials!</p>\n<p>This started as a class task, but I gived it more time to implement new things and learn more in the procces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shoutout to all the creators that made the free assets I used. All of them are in the credits menu!</p>\n<p>Please, tell anything you want about this project, because I need to work more on it and get it better.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T08:04:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f3/1f3e9dc91dd468b4d5ceb0106e087991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["adrian.giner"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
