{"id": 94499, "slug": "britebot", "name": "BRiTEBOT", "name_original": "BRiTEBOT", "description": "<p>This is a 3D puzzle game about collecting wrenches. Each level has a unique gimmick that you must use to help you (for example, pushing blocks, springs, teleporters, etc.)</p>\n<p>There are 12 stages in total. You'll need to complete the first 6 to unlock the bonus night levels.<br/><strong>Note: If the game runs slow make sure you turn off \"good graphics\" in the settings.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>HELP</strong><br/><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/>- In order to collect the wrenches you must move and jump.<br/>- You can hold the move keys but if you need precision I recommend tapping the keys every time you want to move (You can also move faster this way).<br/>- While jumping you can move twice in the air, but you can only jump on top of a block with your first move.<br/>- It's way easier to go over a gap if you <strong>jump first then move</strong>.Trying to jump after walking off an edge isn't fun ;)</p><p><strong>Controls (Change in settings):</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Move: W A S D Keys</li><li>Camera: Arrow Keys (Or drag with mouse)</li><li>Jump: Space</li><li>Pause: Escape/Enter/Select Key (If you get stuck, pause to reset)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Settings:</strong><br/>If the game runs slow I strongly suggest turning off \"good graphics\" in the settings.<br/>Doing this makes the game use spritebatches, but as a result shadows are simplified. Shaders are also disabled in this setting.<br/>Press F11 for fullscreen</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70a/70acd6ef500b036e89676260239acc58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["alesan99"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
