Placing hexagons will give you points, connecting 3 or more hexagons together will increase your multiplier! You can also stack hexagons to make tricky connections, but this will lose you points and multiplier so watch out!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nCONHEXTED was created in approximately a week for the #oneminutejam. As such it is very minimalistic, but I hope you have fun.\r\n</p>\r\nQuick Rules\r\n<p>\r\n\ud83d\udc01\ud83d\udca8 Move with the mouse!<br/>\r\n\ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udccc Place a collection of hex tiles with a left-click<br/>\r\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udd04 Rotate the collection of tiles anti-clockwise with your right-click<br/>\r\n\u23f1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc8 Get a high score in one minute!

I attempted to add this within the jam but it was quite tricky owing to shapes overlapping on placement. I will be looking to address this in a future release.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T07:54:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b090200571c002598a4602ef5c3bcd7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["btsherratt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
