This game is the result of that attempt, it's a platformer, where you shoot cards that have different effects. There's only 4 types of cards right now, I ran out of ideas really quick. There's also only one level for the same reason, but I tried my best to kind of showcase what each card did.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>- Move with WASD<br/></p>\n<p>- Jump with Space</p>\n<p>- Change selected card with Q and E</p>\n<p>- Aim with the mouse cursor</p>\n<p>- Throw cards with Left Mouse Click</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>- Unity for the game</p>\n<p>- Cakewalk for the music</p>\n<p>- Bfxr for the sound effects<br/></p>\n<p>- Piskel for the art</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T09:51:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9770c98ac7a84eeedbfbe36c69b0c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["crbarrios"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
