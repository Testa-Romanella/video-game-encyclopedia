In order to do this job, she has to connect and disconnect the cables of the operator machine to hijack their conversations without being discovered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Context</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>New orders have arrived, agent</em>:</p>\n<p><em>Objective</em>: Infiltrate the Nazis telephone network, hijack their leader\u2019s communications, and decrypt their codes.<br/><em>Codes</em>: At the beginning of your shift, a confident will call you with the code. This code will have some key words that you will have to decrypt.<br/><em>The pigeon</em>: A pigeon will arrive each day with a clue about who has the information you need, you\u2019ll need to listen to their conversations to decrypt the code.\u00a0<br/><em>Call codes</em>: The tags located in the right part of the machine work this way: AM(Initials) + 93(Street Number) + MA(Street Name) = AM93MA.<br/><em>Recorder</em>: You will have a special recorder to eavesdrop on the Nazi conversations. This recorder will have special cables to connect in order to hijack the Nazi communications.</p>\n<p><em>Job</em>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>To connect a call you\u2019ll have to:</p>\n<p>Wait for a connection to illuminate in the left side on the machine.<br/>Left click it.<br/>The caller will tell us the receiver of the call<br/>Then:<br/>If you want to connect the call without listening to it, left click on the connection of the receiver located in the right part of the machine.</p>\n<p>If you want to hijack it, right click on the connection of the receiver located in the right part of the machine. This will connect our recorder to the machine. To disconnect the recorder, right click it. You can disconnect the recorder mid-call, but the Nazis will suspect something if their conversations are cut suddenly.</p>\n<p><em>Decrypting</em>: While listening to a conversation you will have to look for the key words that our confident gave us. This conversation will appear as text bubbles on the screen, and you will have to left click the bubbles with the key words. Depending on the number of key words found you will either be able to decrypt the code, or not.</p>\n<p><em>The supervisor</em>: Your supervisor will keep an eye on you during your shift. He will walk around the building and check on you once in a while during your shift. He will always knock the door before entering, and you will have to hide the recorder from him, hence unplugging its cables from the machine.</p>\n<p><em>Game Over</em>: If you are discovered by the supervisor with your recorder plugged in the machine, you disconnect your recorder too much in the middle of an important call, or you don\u2019t reach a minimum of calls connected, you will fail the mission.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Good luck soldier!</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0dd4e62db9b8af9fb66fa4acda1f6f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Rodrysson", "miroky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
