{"id": 278, "slug": "horizon-zero-dawn", "name": "Horizon Zero Dawn", "name_original": "Horizon Zero Dawn", "description": "<p>Horizon Zero Dawn is an experiment. A very impressive experiment that actually succeeded. <br />\nHaving a very curious mix of cyberpunk and prehistorical styles and esthetic, the game provides us with quite a unique experience. We need to arm ourselves with arrows and a bow, with a spear or any other prehistorical-ish weapon in order to defeat out enemies - dinosaur-mechanisms that are spread around the world. If that wasn&#39;t enough, Aloy our main protagonist can control an AI named GAIA. What we&#39;re having here is an exciting connection with &quot;very old times&quot; and &quot;near future&quot;, even though the game is set up in the 31st century. <br />\nBeing an outcast with her father Rost, Aloy must restore her position in the tribe and save the world by stopping the Eclipse, a cult that wants to rule the world. Join her on that journey, exploring the world and people that live in such hard surroundings.</p>", "metacritic": 89, "released": "2017-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-20T23:19:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b7d/b7d3f1715fa8381a4e780173a197a615.jpg", "website": "https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon", "rating": 4.29, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 670, "owned": 6913, "beaten": 2851, "toplay": 804, "dropped": 719, "playing": 484}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 480, "ratings_count": 3632, "suggestions_count": 625, "game_series_count": 2, "reviews_count": 3683, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Guerrilla Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
