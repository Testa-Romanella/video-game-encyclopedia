Collect all the blocks that have your color, build up the multiplier and get the most points. But beware: The block you are in, rotates, you change colors and the longer you take, the harder it gets.</p><p>Use WASD and SPACE to move around. F1 restarts the scene after launching the game. ESCAPE lets you go back to the main menu. The \"QUIT GAME\" button is still in it, since it is going to be a normal desktop game and it doesn't hurt.</p><p> For every block of your color you get, you increase your multiplier by one and get the points. Get a wrong one and you lose your multiplier, but not your points, unless you totally bonk it.</p><p>After a total of 5 minutes the maximum of the difficulty has been reached. I will try and change some settings and add a goal to reach (an amount of points i.e.) and a game over (the block you are within could get smaller).</p><p>The entire project started as a tutorial for some students and that's the reason, almost everything is from the unity engine, only the music, sounds and my logo are from outside.</p><p>Credits:<br/></p><p>Music - KevinMacleod (The one and only)</p><p>Sounds - Free (From about 10-15 Years ago.
