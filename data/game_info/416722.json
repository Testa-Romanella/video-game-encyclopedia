The theme was \"Repair\".\u00a0\u00a0</p>\r\nRules:\r\n<p>The goal of the bus is to keep your bus running as\u00a0<strong>long as possible</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>There are five pieces of equipment in the bus that you need to maintain. Watch their status lights:</p>\n<ul><li>If the light is green, its working fine.</li><li>If its amber, its faulty, and you should repair it.</li><li>If its red, you should\u00a0<strong>really</strong>\u00a0repair it! Any red equipment will cause the integrity of the bus to deteriorate and eventually stop.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Repair equipment by walking up to it and entering in the button codes that light up on the machine. If you enter a code incorrectly, the code will reset and you will have to start again.\r\n</p>\n<p>The final score on the odometer is the distance which you have travelled.\u00a0</p>\r\nControls (Xbox Controller Required):\r\n<ul><li>Analogue Stick: Move Left/Right</li><li>A Button: Jump</li><li>Left-Bumper: Zoom Out</li><li>D-Pad/A-B-X-Y: Enter repair code sequences</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>David\u00a0 Eichman\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Programming</li><li>Michael Gillon\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Programming, Level Design and Effects\u00a0</li><li>David Strachan\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Programming</li><li>Craig Innes\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 3D modelling and character\u00a0</li><li>Alicja Ukleja\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a03D modelling, designed and modelled\u00a0the bus body</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-02T04:43:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f9/5f929645002fffab476c5d0f1dd7926c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AlicjaUkleja"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
