Starting with 'empty lots' automatically upgrading them to palaces (eventually) when sufficient resources are available.</p>\n<p>30+ resources. Every resource is required to improve housing or provide resources to produce other resources.</p>\n<p>50+ levels of production buildings per resource. Production buildings have a fixed cost, with an increasing cost and production per level. Upgrading buildings is not automatic: you decide whether to upgrade (at certain cost) the level, which will cost more incrementally, will need more workers and other resources and produce more.</p>\n<p>An advisor will hint to the next steps needed to grow the city.</p>\n<p>Housing generates income to buy more space. Space costs increasingly more, but is automatically bought. The newly acquired space can be used to build more housing or other buildings.</p>\n<p>Many different aspects of city happiness: unemployment, government, safety buildings to name a few. Every building will be able to facilitate a certain amount of population.</p>\n<p>Over 400 city achievements give small bonuses to city production. Multiple cities can be build, each with different starting conditions for production. Each city will trade with other cities and will contribute partly to a faster growth of other cities.</p>\n<p>Monuments are great structures in cities which provide a bonus to resource production for all cities. Monuments require significant resources and build over several steps.</p>\n<p>Cities will trade resources with all other cities, providing there is a surplus of the resource being traded in the city.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-25T04:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df915e8fc5b7b208251b7150658f66d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WoodyMiller"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
