{"id": 27538, "slug": "maze", "name": "Maze", "name_original": "Maze", "description": "The original design of the game \"Maze\" was to simulate the real environment when encountering a maze in reality, breaking the necessary map guidance elements in previous games. If players have a strong sense of direction, the game will become dull, but if players have a poor sense of direction, playing this game is simply torture oneself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe current experience version provides steel themed scenes in the game, with 5 built-in maps.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe first level, difficulty - very easy. This is the initial map of the game. After our production team tests, we can find the endpoint within 1 minute. I believe that no matter how crazy the road is, people will not get lost in it;<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe second level, difficulty easy, the overall difficulty of this maze has slightly increased, adding players to jump (space key) and squat (Ctrl key) operations, but it is not complex and can be completed in a few minutes;<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe third level, difficulty - ordinary, this maze seems complex, and the results of internal testing can also be found in about 5 minutes to find the endpoint;<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fourth level, difficulty difficulty, this maze is different from other mazes and is a map that tests players' operations. In this map, there is no unique route to reach the finish line, but players need to calmly deal with it and seize the opportunity;<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fifth level, difficulty - very difficult, this maze is the true meaning of the maze, the difficulty is very high, and the person who can walk out smoothly must be a genius. (Of course, in the game, two hidden points have been specially set up to reduce difficulty appropriately. Finding these two hidden points will help players reduce a lot of difficulty.)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-08T06:32:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f18/f18bc165888ab656c70595e2069d38f6.jpg", "website": "https://www.treefallgames.com/maze", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Wii U", "macOS", "Android"], "developers": ["TreeFall Studios L.L.C.", "TreeFall Studios", "Eli Brewer", "BAZOOKA Studio", "StarJumping Studio", "Top Spell", "\u91cd\u5e86\u65cb\u5ba2\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["TreeFall Studios L.L.C.", "TreeFall Studios", "StarJumping Studio", "Top Spell", "\u91cd\u5e86\u65cb\u5ba2\u6587\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8"], "esrb_rating": null}
