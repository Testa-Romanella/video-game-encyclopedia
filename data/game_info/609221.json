{"id": 609221, "slug": "3rees-for-fairchild-channel", "name": "3rees for Fairchild Channel", "name_original": "3rees for Fairchild Channel", "description": "<p>A game for the Fairchild Channel F, written in F8 assembly language. As an adaption of the game 2048, it took just a few hours to add the graphics and the\u00a0extra rules that make Threes a trickier game to master than 2048.</p>\n<p>The aim is to get the highest score possible before you run out moves.</p>\n<p>When you move the joystick all the blocks that have space\u00a0will move ONE square in that direction.\u00a0When a moving block of 3\u00a0or above\u00a0meets a stationary block of\u00a0the same value, they combine to create a block with double the value.</p>\n<p>Unlike 2048, blocks containing 1 or 2 can only combine with each other and not themselves, therefore it's important to keep an eye on them and make sure 1's or 2's are not bunched together filling up the grid.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Every time you make a move a new block is randomly placed on the opposite edge of the grid to the direction you moved. So if you move all the blocks left, a new block will appear on the right side of the grid.</p>\n<p>To help with forward planning, the next new block to be placed on the grid is show in the top right of the screen.</p>\r\nGame Modes\u00a0\r\n<ul><li>768 - the game finishes when you achieve a block with a value of 768. Try and achieve this in the quickest time possible!\r\n</li><li>Long - the game continues until you create the largest block possible of 12,288\u00a0or there are no more moves available.\r\n</li><li>Time - you have three minutes to achieve the highest score you can.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Game modes are selected based on which button you press on the title screen.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How To Run</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The .bin file can be played in MAME or MESS, you will probably\u00a0need to locate the\u00a0sl31253.rom/sl90025.rom and sl31254.rom BIOS files in order to successfully play Channel F games. I can't distribute these with the game but they are easily found on Google.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>This online emulator can also be used, as above you'll need to provide the BIOS roms.\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34262\r\n</p>\n<p>From the command line:\r\n</p>\n<p>mess channelf -cart C:\\tents.rom -w -r 720x720 -nodebug\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T06:57:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/990/990aa1dc1b4d0350a0702287d0e7b78f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
