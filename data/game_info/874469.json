You know what to do.<br/><br/>Welcome to FUCK HITLER.<br/><br/><h3>PLAY MODE</h3>The basic mode in FUCK HITLER. Grab Adolf and throw him in the air, play with him as you see fit. You can also play with MP44 and grenades inflicting massive damage to him, and beat him over the head with his own artwork.<h3>SPAWN HITLER</h3>You can create an infinite number of Hitlers. Create as many of them as you need by choosing among a rich array of skins: Hitler, Giga Chad Hitler, Big Titty Hitler, Devil Hitler, Alien Hitler and Baby Hitler (super cute).<h3>BUILD MODE</h3>Create your own constructions and test which ones will do the most harm to Adolf. You can choose from several basic blocks such as Cube or Ball and special blocks such as Sawblade or Spinning Swastika, which effectively cause harm to the F\u00fchrer of the Third Reich and earn points with which you can climb higher in the public leaderboard and earn achievements.<h3>PHOTO MODE</h3>Photo mode gives you full freedom to create unique screenshots.
