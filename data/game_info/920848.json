One of our bots has been injected with a virus which they can pass on by interfacing with the other bots.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>When the virus is in you, you have to \"tag\" another bot to pass it on. To help the infected bot, the virus gives them \"root access\" and grants special abilities like speed boosts, cloaking powers, and range attacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To avoid being tagged, the other bots have to run away, set up traps, and use their environment to keep their distance. At the end of the round, whoever has spent the least amount of time with the virus is the most secure robot and passes the test!<br/></p>\n<p>From Team Green Locomotive\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adam Clewes-Boyne / @adamb1234\r\n</p>\n<p>Ana Batistic / ScoredEarth\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:44:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f95/f957df96500c2e8c38f44ca1b9da06ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["adamb1234"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
