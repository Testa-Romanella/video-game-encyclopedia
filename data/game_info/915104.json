We did not choose to abstract the term \"harvest\" but chose the simplest and most authentic way to express \"harvest\". We hope all players harvest fun, love and whatever this year.</p>\n<p>Although idyllic time is beautiful, there are also some troubles simultaneously. You are not the only one waiting for the fruit. There are also many birds. They also want to share the joy of harvest with you, but tooooo many!!! Watch out, your crops are few and far between. So you're harvesting fruit while keeping the birds from eating up your crops.</p>\n<p>Basically, this is a 2.5D shooting survival game by Alison Liu and Carsten Chen. Enjoy!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T06:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/23c/23c158f9bdb4f5377f47b195dd051d15.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Carsten"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
