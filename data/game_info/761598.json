If it reaches 0 you ded lol</p>\n<p>Bottom bar is your energy.\u00a0Shoot the plasma orbs to get energy and fill up the bar. Once its filled you can actually hit the enemy for a bit.<br/></p>\n<p>Green stuff is health.</p>\n\n<p>Controls (With Lore):</p>\n<p>You are a space cadet in the employ of the Intergalactic Fleet, and are part of a division that investigates and resolves temporal-spatial anomalies. A\u00a0particularly dangerous rift has opened up near your headquarters, and since your division is woefully understaffed they have no choice but to send you to resolve the issue.<br/></p>\n<p>You will be flying in your trusty Firefly, which uses the advanced system\u00a0C.U.R.So.R to move and the\u00a0LEFT-Cli.CK interface\u00a0to shoot.<br/></p>\n<p>The anomaly is a mirror-type anomaly. It is the result of a fracture in space-time that causes a bubble where objects that enter will have a mirrored counterpart.\u00a0Yes, this means that you will be fighting a mirror version of your self, one who\u00a0will mimic your movements and firing pattern.</p>\n<p>Luckily, due to certain fluctuations in the Bayesian temporal fields caused by the anomaly, the anomaly's projectiles travel slower than yours, giving you enough time to let your bullets tear through it and close the anomaly off.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, your regular bullets just won't cut it. Different planes of existence and all.</p>\n<p>Not to worry, however! These anomalies tend to produce mass amounts of energy which are consolidated into plasma orbs. By breaking apart and collecting the energy from these orbs, you should be able to charge your weapons for a brief period of time which you can use to deal significant damage to the anomaly. The total amount of energy collected is displayed on the bottom of your screen as a cyan bar.<br/></p>\n<p>Ignoring the issue is not an option. The anomaly gets more unstable as time passes, and will release a deadly particle stream if it is allowed to destabilize.\u00a0Its destabilization process is tracked via the red bar at the top of your screen.\u00a0Fortunately,\u00a0 by shooting you are able to force the mirror anomaly to discharge its energy and delay the destabilization process.\u00a0 Be warned, however, as time goes on, the anomaly will destabilize faster and faster, so eliminating the threat as fast as possible is a top priority.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck cadet! You're going to need it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-04T09:58:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/747/74789c1bd454b2c60c04811f704b905e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["The4thAD"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
