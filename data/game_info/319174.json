{"id": 319174, "slug": "midknight-story", "name": "MidKnight Story", "name_original": "MidKnight Story", "description": "MidKnight Story is a story driven adventure action-rpg set in a steampunk &amp; fantasy open world.<br/>\r\nThe game focuses on three core gameplay experiences: Exploration, combat, and story. The player will take control of Paran, a young scavenger, who's able to explore the game world in its entirety, climbing up buildings and towers in the main city, swimming on the surface and underwater to reach wild islands and grottoes, gliding and dashing with a special sword, sneaking into tight spaces, and breaking through walls with explosive barrels. In terms of combat, Paran can approach his nemeses hidden and launch a surprise attack, or he can throw himself into battle head-on. The choice is up to the player. He will also need to alternate between using his sword and pistol to best defeat each enemy. In exploring the world of Numia, and defeating the enemies he finds there, Paran earns Gears and collects ammunition, potions, and experience points. To collect these XPs, he must use the special capabilities of the sword. Like in many classic RPGs, experience points are needed to level up and improve Paran\u2019s stats. By discovering secret places and defeating the most formidable enemies, Paran will earn rare treasures to keep in his collection.<br/>\r\nMidKnight Story's adventure begins when Paran discovers the sword called Durindana. The legendary sword will serve him in more than just combat against enemies, in fact it will be the very key he needs to unlock the world of MidKnight Story and to reach new levels within it. The sword will be upgradeable to unlock new abilities, with features such as the propeller that allows Paran to glide from place to place and reach areas previously unexplorable.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/425/425833232657ff2760c5dca8b2b77ac1.jpg", "website": "https://www.midknightstory.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 588, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mattia Ciurlino"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Mattia Ciurlino"], "esrb_rating": null}
