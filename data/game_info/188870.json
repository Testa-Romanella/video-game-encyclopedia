This project plays like a standard 2D shooter in the vain of Mega Man and Metroid, but there's a catch; the level is in complete darkness. And you can't take it slow; your HP drains over time, so you have to rush into the unknown.</p><p>As according to the theme, everything is designed to have a dual purpose.. For example, you can move the player's soul with the mouse to light the way, but it also serves as your reticle for shooting. You can also use enemy pickups to recover HP, or you can gather them with your soul to temporarily increase how bright it is.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Created by</strong>:\u00a0Pierce Taylor</p><p><strong>Intended Platforms</strong>:\u00a0Windows, Mac, and Linux (Only tested on Windows))\u00a0</p><p><strong>Software Used:\u00a0</strong>Unity, Photoshop, and Paint</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3aa/3aa9ff36087013b3df5d8eb0c32f6936.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Professor Chronic"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
