As you progress, you will start to build the game around. The game is a little bit inspired by \u201cThere is no Game\u201d, and it has a \u201cClicker-Game\u201d feel to it. I also made the game all alone, with the exception of the music, that is creative commons. But the audio effects where edited by me.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately i couldn\u2019t develop the game further, and it is a bit short, but i\u2019m really happy that i was able to make a fully functional game without help.</p>\n<p>The game was made in the Godot Engine because is the engine that i like the most for making 2d Games. Feel free to criticize and give advice, ideas, or more!</p>\n<p><strong><br/><br/>Browsers recomended: <em>Chrome or Firefox</em></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T09:57:05", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["MatheusPese"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
