No additional custom assets were used; just whatever came with the software.<br/></p>\n<p>The story is about a student of Ace Academy, a school that educates and trains up-and-coming adventurers, explorers and scholars. The student, Zura, goes on various missions assigned by the academy to test her abilities as a new adventurer.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls: <br/>Enter/Z - Confirm<br/>Esc/X - Cancel &amp; Open Menu<br/>Arrow Keys - Movement<br/>Q - Previous Page<br/>W - Next Page<br/></p>\n<p>This build currently up for download is to show off what I've managed to create so far.
