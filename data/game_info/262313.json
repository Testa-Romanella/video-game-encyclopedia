{"id": 262313, "slug": "super-bunny-kick", "name": "Super Bunny Kick", "name_original": "Super Bunny Kick", "description": "<p>Katy, a skilled mech pilot and member of a four-woman unit of fellow pilots, is dragged back into action when her allies and former friends are reported to have gone rogue. Fight through three challenging levels and bosses with the Red Rabbit mech, and kick some sense into Katy's friends... with the power of love of course!</p>\n<p>Initially developed during the two months of Yuri Jam 2018, and soon to be polished, fleshed out, and hopefully\u00a0completed within the coming month.</p>\n<p>If you want to follow our development and be notified when the game is fully released\u00a0(it'll still be free!), or talk about possible fixes or improvements to the game,\u00a0come stop by our discord server! It's okay if you only come there to lurk too, we don't mind.</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/xtsMg2g</p>\n<p>What sort of updates can be expected? Well, first of all, there's a lot of obvious missing sprites and graphical effects to be added. Next, through testing and feedback I plan to improve and balance the level designs and boss fights a bit more, as well as squash some bugs. Finally, and most importantly, there's a lot of dialog and story content to be added, with more cutscenes, and visual novel-esque segments that go more in depth with the relationships between Katy and the other girls, as well as their backstories and the continuation of the plot.\u00a0Yes, this is indeed where the real meat of the YURI CONTENT will be happening! Look forward to it!</p>\n<p>The Dev Squad:</p>\n<p>Programming, Art, Design - Fiore<br/></p>\n<p>Music - Alice Latte\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sound Effects - Gubbles</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f7/9f7fc0b9c63b377d7764dcfc65af94af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Firecat1311"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
