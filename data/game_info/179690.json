Please leave any feedback and report bugs when you find them. </p><p>Prepare to have your free time demolished as you pilot your ship against the Teratrons' Light Ships. Their only mode of attack is to advance forward, but you can blow them to smithereens when you match four or more of them with your light bombs. Beware, however, because if you don't match four, they'll commandeer your light bomb, and turn it into one of their own fighter ships. </p><p>Once you've destroyed their advanced guards, you'll need to take out their mother-ships as well! This could be the battle to save Earth!</p><p>Do you have the stamina for this? - The Teratrons are keep evolving on you as you fight through wave after wave of advance guards, the mother-ships will send out new types of attacks as you continue.</p><p>Maybe you just want bragging rights! - Challenge your Facebook friends to beat your awesomeness when you post your ultimate high score in survival mode. </p><p>Name your ship - No pilot worth their salt would fly any ship they haven't christened first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f1/0f1258e2973aa579d45169f2e47febf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 129, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sub-Zero Squirrel"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
