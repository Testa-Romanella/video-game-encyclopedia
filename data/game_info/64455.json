Here, the story is all. You can discover each part of the story at your own pace, but the game is designed to be completed in one sitting - there is no save function and your progress will not be stored if you decide to stop playing.<br/><br/>Once you start the game, you're totally on your own. There's no main menu, no guidance, no tutorial. Just head towards the green light when you're ready to proceed...", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc8/cc8fa0bece3e0fd2d47c7e36bc65d50b.jpg", "website": "http://xiotex-studios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 112, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Xiotex Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Xiotex Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
