A sleepy town called Creekside. A mysterious whirring jolts you from your sugar coma. As you peer out the window, wiping the sleep from your eyes, you question your sanity: Hordes of Creeps assemble around ominous antennas! Where are the cops?! Where are the adults?! Is no one going to stop this?! It turns out that the nefarious Dr. Apollyon opened a portal to the Bottomless Pit. It\u2019s going to be up to you to stop Dr. Apollyon before he takes over the world! But first, save Creekside so we can all get back to trick-or-treating!<br/><br/>You play as a reluctant, middle-school hero named Squirt who awakens on Halloween to discover his town overrun by Creeps. Squirt\u2019s weapons of warfare are randomized guns and costumes with unique abilities. Squirt\u2019s gun has randomized attributes; deplete Squirt\u2019s ammo, and Squirt will automatically switch to another randomized gun. Collect upgrade tokens to permanently unlock new ammo types. Roguelite means lots of deaths, but store upgrades, ammo unlocks, costume unlocks and money carryover. Five distinct zones make up Creekside; complete objectives to advance to the next zone.<br/><br/>Creekside Creep Invasion garners inspiration from the gameplay of Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne; the contemporary sub/urban setting of old school games like  TMNT arcade, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and River City Ransom; and a dash of the whimsy of EarthBound mixed in.<br/><br/><strong>Features include:</strong><br/><strong>+ Contemporary(80's) small town on Halloween night setting.<br/><br/>+ Randomized guns with over 20 unique ammo types that transform when you reload.<br/><br/>+ Upgrade seven stats and find power-ups.<br/><br/>+ Dozens of perk based armor pieces to equip in five armor slots.<br/><br/>+ 15 Costumes with unique passive and activated abilities. <br/><br/>+ Handcrafted; procedurally generated levels (Maps are handcrafted and connected procedurally to create levels).<br/><br/>+ Permanent unlocks and store upgrades.<br/><br/>+ Dozens of enemy types.<br/><br/>+ Lots of surprises and secrets.<br/><br/>+ 60 fps<br/><br/>+ Controller / keyboard &amp; mouse support</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5be/5bec002dba00d99a21479f1cfe7c7761.jpg", "website": "http://creeksidecreepinvasion.tumblr.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 18}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ouch Giver Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ouch Giver Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
