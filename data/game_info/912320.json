Each world contains wild environments such as a small neighbourhood with a colourful buffalo mechanic and a winter landscape with a stumbling bumbling salaryman late for work. Don't forget to chat with the rest of the citizens as you try to find your cab to get on with the day.<br/></p>\r\nContent Warning\r\n<ul><li>Nudity</li><li>Flashing Lights</li><li>Mentions of Violence</li><li>Swearing</li></ul>\n<p>###########\r\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>(Tank-like controls)<br/></p>\n<p>[WASD] to Move\r\n    </p>\n<p>[Q] Turn Left\r\n    </p>\n<p>[E] Turn Right\r\n    </p>\n<p>[ESC] Pause <br/></p>\n<p>[SPACE] Dialog<br/></p>\n<p>###########</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n<p>A game developed by: JUGGY</p>\n<p>Music created by: Fidel Delgado https://fideldelgado.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>Made in Godot 3.5</p>\n<p>Cover created in Bryce 4<br/></p>\n<p>###########<br/></p>\r\nDev Notes\r\n<p>This is my submission for LSDJAM 2022. Took about a month to create(minus the procrastination). The game might not be fun for many, it most definitely won't make sense and there will be bugs. Optimization of code isn't here and to be honest that's part of the charm with this game. Much thanks for the people that played this. Much thanks to Figglewatts for hosting and much thanks to\u00a0Osamu Sato(and Asmik Ace team) for making LSD: Dream Emulator for inspiration. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T12:22:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d61/d61b97093235068a66ae5a92e4d89d09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["FidelDelgado", "juggy"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
