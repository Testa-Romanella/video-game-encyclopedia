{"id": 1366, "slug": "140-itch", "name": "140", "name_original": "140", "description": "<p>140 is a platformer developed by Jeppe Carlsen. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>140 uses music synchronization as an important part of the gameplay. The player leads a geometric object \u2013 a circle when moving, a square when standing still.<br />\nThere are four levels; each one has its soundtrack. As the game gets harder, the music intensifies. The player has to avoid enemies presented as other geometric shapes. There are also static noise platforms that should be avoided as well. The game is known for its synesthesia effect \u2013 a cognitive phenomenon associated with graphene, color, number or music-related experience. Someone with synesthesia can simultaneously observe things \u2013 for example, colors \u2013 like everybody else but at the same time distinguish their colors. Everything in the game moves according to the music beat, so to jump over an obstacle or to climb on a lift, the player should synchronize his moves to the rhythm. </p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>140 was developed independently. It grew out of other Carlsen&#39;s works and proceeded similar features, for example, its minimalistic old school design and simple mechanics. The game was released on several platforms, such as Microsoft, PlayStation, and Linux. </p>\n<h3>Reception</h3>\n<p>The game aroused interest due to its minimalism and synesthesia traits. It was widely tested by critics and journalists and was praised for its design and audio background.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2013-10-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-20T16:31:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560f7bd45d2f8ce3deb42c97fd1d1f49.jpg", "website": "http://www.carlsengames.com", "rating": 3.62, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 64, "owned": 1051, "beaten": 66, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 18, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 35, "ratings_count": 88, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 90, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Wii U", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Double Fine Productions", "Abstraction Games", "Carlsen Games", "CarlsenJeppe"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Double Fine Productions", "Carlsen Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
