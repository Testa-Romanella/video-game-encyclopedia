A better bridge, so much more secure\u00a0than it's\u00a0predecessor, now spans the worlds allowing his henchmen to carry the\u00a0minerals, oils and precious gems back from Tyche's once free lands,\u00a0with the citizens enslaved to toil for Moosh's greed.</p>\n<p>But the\u00a0resistance is growing, and if only their leader was back\u00a0amongst them they could start to fight against the tyranny.\u00a0And so -\u00a0with his trusty staff smuggled into the prison - Tyche has escaped his\u00a0captors and must start to make the journey home...</p>\n\n<p>Back in the late\u00a01980's I wrote <strong>Stranded</strong>, but\u00a0my\u00a0coding skills weren't\u00a0up to much back then and so I had to limit my ideas for the game to\u00a0match what I could achieve at the time. Nearly 20 years\u00a0later, and\u00a0armed with a far greater knowledge of the Spectrum, I felt I was good\u00a0enough to revisit the idea and write the game as I had wanted to all\u00a0those years ago, and so Stranded 2.5 was born.</p>\n<p>Featuring a\u00a0fully-masked player character, additional features to the\u00a0original such as switches and rotating blocks, a full music score by\u00a0Lee du-Caine, and all displayed in a crisp 2.5D (hence the title) I\u00a0feel I'd achieved what I had originally intended to. The\u00a0music needs a\u00a0special mention here as Lee produced over 35K of original tunes, nearly\u00a010 in all, which was also released on CD by Ubiktune.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MicroMart</strong> - \"<em>Though this\u00a0remains strictly a puzzle game, it's\u00a0simple, yet challenging, and has addictiveness to keep you entertained\u00a0for hours ...
