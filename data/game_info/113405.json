It is an experimental format and it is currently in alpha. The first chapter, or tutorial sequence, was finished in time to be submitted for the Cyberpunk Game Jam. As a result, the game currently ends after the (very short) Tulip Neighborhood.</p><p>\r\n\tThe mechanics of New Heights are all developed; continued work on the game will involve generating further content to continue the story as it is currently laid out. Note: certain systems are not flipped on yet, for further testing.</p><p>\r\n\tStory/design/development by: Skyler Hartle [twitter]</p><p>Illustrations by: Antonio Mendez</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d9/2d99be0954011e2b48288c4d75f19ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["skylerhartle"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
