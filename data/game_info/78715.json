Sounds simple, but there\u2019s a catch: you can\u2019t backtrack over a line you\u2019ve already drawn, you must complete the drawing with one touch! This seemingly simple rule will leave you scratching your head as you work through the different paths.<br/><br/>Constellate is full of hand-created levels that increase in difficulty. It starts off easy enough, with simple geometric shapes and an obvious solution. By the time you finish Galaxy 1, however, you\u2019ll have an appreciation for the challenges that lie ahead!<br/><br/>Constellate embraces its space theme fully in both visuals and sound effects. The gorgeous design is complemented by the galactic sound effects. This is a puzzle game unlike any other out there.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>---Three different Galaxy levels<br/>---More than 40 achievements to collect!<br/>---Rewarding and challenging gameplay<br/>---No \u201cenergy\u201d or lives to regenerate! Play as much as you want!<br/>---Additional levels in development!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T00:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/862/8629af93f1df68155f08058a5979b2a4.jpg", "website": "https://randomlogicgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Conversion"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Conversion"], "esrb_rating": null}
