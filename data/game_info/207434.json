The goal of the game is to destroy the silence by making noise. You control the C Major who produces musical notes. All you have to do is aim him at the silence notes by moving him up and down. The trick is you don't use any keys. You use your device's microphone to control him up and down. The louder the higher, the quieter the lower. The silence notes show up at random intervals so you'll really have to work for it, going up and down. Another fun way to play the game would be scoring musical artists. Try playing some Beethoven on another musical device see how he score. Then some Yung Thug or Beyonce, see how they perform.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f51/f511ed8cc9b31a9ee932f5992a8d6a72.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nchima"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
