As you play the game the main story will change depending on the choices you make (whether you know you are making them or not). Rather than focusing specifically on \"multiple endings\" with specific paths\u00a0like other games, Blight focuses on affecting the story as you experience it with paths that constantly intertwine.\u00a0Events may or may not occur depending on decisions you make, and\u00a0dialogue between characters\u00a0 can change depending what those characters have done or seen.\u00a0Changes can also affect things that happen later or even open up more options that also affect game play.</p>\n<p>The main idea is that multiple people can play this game and have very different experiences while at the same time experiencing the same story. For example:\u00a0\"Remember when you went to this place and met this character?\" Someone else may have played differently and not encountered those things at all!\u00a0This promotes\u00a0exploration and replayability to uncover deeper truths and discover new pieces of information about the story. (Be careful of how deep you dig however. You\u00a0may not like what you find hidden within the truth of Blight.)</p>\n<p>Be sure to share this game with your friends and see how the story unfolds for them!\u00a0This is only 1 chapter, and there is obviously more story to tell. If this game reaches any sort of demand for that I would love to continue working on it. In any case, I\u00a0hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Featuring music by CrazyGroupTrio.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This game does use assets created by other creators that have publicly allowed them to be used for non-commercial means.
