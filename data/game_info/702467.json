Create material- skybox and drag in your new asset. Under environment- lighting, drag and drop your new skybox. https://polyhaven.com/a/kloppenheim_03 Created by Greg Zaal Sponsored by Goro Fujita\r\n  </li><li>Created a new level, Level 3- Created new skybox material and added to environment lighting.   </li><li>I learned about Unity free assets to find new textures and added grass to level 3. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/nature/grass-and-flowers-pack-1-17100?aid=1011ld79j&amp;utm_campaign=unity_affiliate&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=partnerize-linkmaker. Learned how to download a Unity Package from the asset store.\r\n  </li><li>Using Photoshop, I created another texture for grey rock and added to level 3.\r\n  </li><li>Created new music using MagicMusicMaker64 for all three levels. Used the same music from level 1 for the main menu music. I like how this really differentiates the levels. The Music gets more layers as you progress through the levels.\r\n  </li><li>Recreated Level 2 with new gate to access portal to third level.\r\n  </li><li>Added player inside the building to start level 1. I think it gives the illusion that you were portaled to the planet.\r\n  </li><li>Removed Boss from Level 2 and put in Level 3, had to redo all of the prefabs in order to make this change.\r\n  </li><li>Added an instructions page to the menu and had to learn how to make them scroll to fit on the page using the UI Scroll View and figuring out that the text object needs to be checked \u201cmaskable\u201d.\r\n  </li><li>Created a minimap camera and wrote a little script with the help of Bernard Polidario @weeklyhow.com. I wanted to be able to see the enemies sneaking up around me, since the player camera view was very limited.\r\n  </li><li>I changed the script for the enemy pick-ups to guarantee pick-up of one item. I just changed the percentages from spread out to 1 under the different enemies in level 3.\r\n  </li><li>Created a \u201cbread trail\u201d of pick-ups in level 3 to guide the player to the Boss fight.\r\n  </li><li>Created a Victory Scene from the Main Menu Page and remembered to update the UI Manager Page Management. Then, in Level 3, under the LevelEndPortal, PortalSurface, I set the name of scene to load as VictoryScene. I also have the Defeat message that pops up, if you die too many times.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Created by Stacy Jenkins and Michigan State University Games</p>\n<p>Klendathu is a planet name from the movie Starship Troopers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T05:05:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f48032b32b8261eea89c17226cb041.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["SquirrelJ"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
