Players are divided into two teams: Loyalists vs. Leakers. Loyalists try to help the President by recommending and voting for task forces loyal to the President. Leakers try to pose as Loyalists to earn trust and get into task forces to leak confidential information. There are roles on both teams that gives them special abilities and strategies, and there are secret powers that can turn the tides at any moment.

We do too! But we noticed some shortcomings in the genre. They are sometimes hard to set up and inconvenient to play. Some games need too much room or a big table, some require a moderator with godlike precision, some require to close your eyes for minutes, and quite often the game is ruined because someone forgot to do their part correctly or a newbie player asked the wrong question and revealed their secret. We have built Republic of Jungle to address to these issues and distill the fun of social deduction games into a more enjoyable and convenient experience. Inspired by Jackbox Games, we have built a platform where players can use their smartphones (or any device with a browser) to play the game. This way, the game does all the moderation for you, guides the players throughout the game and adds a fun narrative on top. More importantly, we have unique mechanics specific to this platform because they are almost impossible to implement in a traditional tabletop setting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T02:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/29f/29fc9038c5716c7ea345e84d0a0d811c.jpg", "website": "https://republicofjungle.com/?utm_source=steam", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 230, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gerdoo Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Gerdoo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
