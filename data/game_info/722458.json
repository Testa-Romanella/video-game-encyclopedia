I made this game to prove to myself that I can actually finish a project, and gave myself one day to do as such. The result was this project. It includes a high score system (as long as you keep the game open), among other various things. I likely won't be updating this, but there's a chance. Also, you might want to mute the game. I don't know how loud it is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T10:07:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2b7a42e7228aa7e0eb5fcdcc6a6f24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["oiKeTTLe"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
