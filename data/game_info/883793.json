Osou is a rhythm hell meaning you have to survive a bullet hell all to the beat of a song.\u00a0 So yes this game is hard; the tutorial is hard; the final levels are hard. I suggest starting with 'Beloved Tomboyish Girl' or 'Lullaby of a Deserted Hell' if you are having trouble.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you do well please post your scores on the Osou discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/H8t4sN95<br/></p>\n\n<p>You need a mouse to play this game</p><p>EDIT: A lot of people are downloading but no one is leaving feedback, so please if you have the time, it would mean a lot to us if you would leave some brief feedback in the comments.
