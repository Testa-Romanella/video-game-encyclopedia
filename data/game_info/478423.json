ReColor is a\u00a0platformer, puzzler where you can change the color of your cube to solve puzzles. The main mechanic is that you can Rewind through all of the colors you switched to in the current puzzle.<br/><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\r\nActionControlMove LeftLeft Arrow or AMove RightRight Arrow or DJumpSpacebarInteractFRewind ColorRReset PuzzleBackspacePauseEscape\r\n\n<p><strong>Directors Notes</strong><br/>I built this game mostly as a solo project in my free time after work throughout the week of the Game Jam. That said,\u00a0I have credit that need/want to give:<br/><br/>Josh Hovis: Music and Sound Effects (along with general second opinion throughout the process).<br/><br/>Also a special thanks to my friends and coworkers who play test this game. I really couldn't have done it without all of their help.<br/><br/>My biggest take away from this Jam is that I really want to keep working on level and puzzle design. Everything else\u00a0I got setup pretty easily, but I just struggled with puzzle design until the very end. I\u00a0feel like\u00a0I kind of cracked the code for what makes a fun puzzle in this game, but then it was to late. I would have also liked to explore more thematic elements in my game, but that's just a lesson for next time.<br/><br/>Thank you for anyone who has stopped by to play my game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:00:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85c/85c9fdd700344047292352fd1a78adb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Eric Sexton"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
