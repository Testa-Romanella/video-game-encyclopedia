{"id": 831605, "slug": "spider-bean-121", "name": "Spider Bean 1.2.1", "name_original": "Spider Bean 1.2.1", "description": "<p>A short spider-horror game. This game was made as a joke. \"Hey, make a game where beans with spider legs chase you\". It went something like that. This game will probably receive some patch updates in the future. If for some reason someone actually likes the game, please leave a comment with any feedback or ideas for future updates.</p>\n<p>Basically, you run around a forest at either day or night, collecting keys. Every time a spiderbean spots you, it will follow you. Forever. Or at least until you are killed or beat the game. Once you have collected all the keys, find the exit at the top of the hill to escape.</p>\n<p>REMEMBER TO CHECK THE CONTROLS IN-GAME</p>\n<p>I am aware that for some computers, night mode is unplayable because the light doesn't render properly or something. This should be fixed in 1.2 If not, please let me know.</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T17:50:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4bd/4bda985338ca857668ef4e614cd22e60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 127, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Domithicc"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
