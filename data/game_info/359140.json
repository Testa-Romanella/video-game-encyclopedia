Shadow Man, undead demon hunter and protector of the world. In this sequel to Shadow Man, you battle the Grigori, a group of seriously evil demons that have passed themselves off as humans for the past 2,000 years. Not only are they over being human (who wouldn&#39;t be with all those special powers going to waste), but they also want their leader, Asmodeus, returned from the Pit. If they succeed, destruction of biblical proportions will strike mankind asunder. It&#39;s a second coming for Shadow Man.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2002-03-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-16T13:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/99c/99c89b28897900e139500c4ec69a6fa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 2"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
