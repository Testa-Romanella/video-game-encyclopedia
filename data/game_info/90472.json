With a few other victims of the crash, can you craft, mine, and build your way to survival?</p>\n<p>Aground was designed around the theme of Progression, and inspired by Utopian Mining and other mining/crafting games. You start out with almost nothing, and you can eventually build your way up to a thriving settlement.</p>\n<p>Currently, you can only explore and build on the first few islands, but we have lots of plans for expansion, and the sky is literally not the limit.</p>\n<p>We're planning to continue developing Aground based on feedback and suggestions from players, so definitely send me a message or post in our subreddit\u00a0or discord to determine the course of this game.</p>\n<p>Controls are explained in game, and it can be played with keyboard or gamepad. The mouse can also be used to navigate menus (but is not required).<br/></p>\n<p>For players who want to play on multiple computers/versions of the game: Save files can be exported from the Options menu on the title page and imported by dragging and dropping the save file into the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a45/a45259ed0d6213b6a17f79da9e2bebc3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 314, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fancy Fish Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
