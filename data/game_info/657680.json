The theme for this jam is \"Let there be Chaos\". For my game, I have created a 3D First-Person Platformer. In this game, you play as an astronaut who has been infected with an alien virus that is causing him to hallucinate and he must get to an escape pod to return to Earth to get the medical attention that he needs but as he gets closer to the escape pod the virus stars placing obstacles in front of him and they get more challenging as he continues to overcome them. Can you get to the escape pod before the virus kills you?</p><p>Deep Space Skybox pack created by Sean Duffy</p><p>Audio provided by Zapsplat.com</p><p>Code was written by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T04:34:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/edf/edf6a78ca94ea78e7d9e5d0582d88f7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["logmaster109"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
