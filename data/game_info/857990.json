Using only your medical skills and conversation, you must find clues across the colony to track down a fellow missing doctor, whose potential involvement with the rebels could start a war on the home continent. Who you choose to heal can give you clues and direction, but time is precious and you can't save everyone.</p>\n<p>This prototype is a proof of concept, showing a single location with characters to talk to, a few dynamic events, and an opportunity to try out the healing system. There is planned work to expand this game into a complete experience, any feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>Created by Jack Rathbone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T08:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e4/4e43444211649cef37cc71e7672c5c36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jack Rathbone"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
