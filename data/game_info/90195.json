Do this by capturing flags and murderizing enemies.</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\tBesides providing additional spawn points, each flag your team holds increases your Flag Multiplier. This multiplier increases the score you gain per enemy kill. The team score bars indicate what team is currently winning, push out the enemy bar to win the game! You can also win the game by capturing all spawn points.\r\n</p>\r\nInstallation\r\n<p>Open your Ravenfield.zip file and drag the Ravenfield folder to somewhere on your computer. Now open your new Ravenfield folder and start the game.</p>\n<p><strong>For people getting the \"There should be 'ravenfield_Data' folder next to the executable\" error on windows: </strong>Make sure you extract the game by dragging the Ravenfield folder from the ravenfield.zip file to somewhere on your computer. Now open your NEW Ravenfield folder and start the .exe file.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c60/c60148c485f434b473dc640ff55125e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.43, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"owned": 6, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["SteelRaven7"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
