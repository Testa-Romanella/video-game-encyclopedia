Give instructions to your worker to till the soil, plant seeds, and water crops.\u00a0 Grow the products your customers request and earn coins to progress.</strong></p>\n\n\r\n\"Get to work!\"<br/>\n\n<p>The Old Farmer features cute, simple graphics; fun\u00a0sound and music; and relaxing gameplay. Take a load off and become a grumpy old farmer who yells at his poor worker to fulfil customer orders for fruit, vegetables, or flowers.</p>\n\n\r\nCustomers patiently wait for the storeman to get their order.<br/>\n\n<p>This game was a short project, limited to one week. It was inspired partly by farming games such as Stardew Valley, partly by old school adventure games like Monkey Island, and partly by casual management sims.</p><p>The game features a tutorial level, a normal level, and an endless mode. Expect around 5 - 10\u00a0minutes of gameplay to reach endless mode.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Created by Aron Simpson<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits for sound effects and music</strong>\u00a0(https://opengameart.org/):</p>\n<p>erxer1<br/></p>\n<p>jalastram</p>\n<p>LarsG</p>\n<p>Vinrax</p>\n<p>Sound effects and music\u00a0used under the Creative Commons licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T11:48:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba53420d02ae12d6ecf7562e14a26d07.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aron Simpson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
