They also have a bonus/malus on the top right corner, which will be applied to the points of the next bird in line.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to line up the 5 birds in your hand to rack up as much points as possible, then start over until you can't keep the gauge from reaching 0.</p>\n<p>Made in a weekend for Minijam 99.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Design, Art and Code by S\u00e9bastien Gatty, a.k.a.
