Comments are appreciated.</strong></p>\n<p>In this game you are a fish, who wants to search for some treasure chests! Collect air bubbles to gather air supply - you can shoot enemy fish with bubble bullets. Avoid or destroy mines. You can also lure enemy fish to crash on them.\u00a0Collect all treasure to finish the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong> arrow keys to move, space to shoot, escape to return to title screen.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Randomly generated layout each time!</strong> You can choose the map size from 3x3 to 20x20</p>\n<p><strong>Powerups:</strong> hearts will replenish your health, shields will grant you invulnerability for a short time, speed boost - self explanatory, zoom out - the camera zooms out, so you can have a broader view.</p>\n\n<p>The game is still under development, so there may be (or rather surely are)\u00a0bugs :) Doesn't work under Internet Explorer and older versions of Edge. Not tested on Safari.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Underwater artwork by Luis Zuno @ansimuz<br/>Fish artwork by https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com<br/>Heart powerup graphics by knik1985<br/>Bubble graphics by Ouren<br/>Music by Cleyton Kaufmann, Spring and isiah658</p>\n<p>Assets downloaded from Opengameart.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:55:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f58/f58a70b61931c6c56372f684c1b92ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yatchan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
