There is no scoring for this mode and the coins don't do anything atm.</p>\n<p>The Second mode is a Shooter game where you have to find a gun and shoot the enemies. This mode is the most finished. You can spend the coins you get in game to spend in the shop at the start of the mode. High score for the top ten is kept. Bug - if you are unable to move exit mode and try again or go to other mode first to reset controls.</p>\n<p>The third mode is a Maze. You need to navigate your way to the exit. Nothing happens at the exit so you will need to exit with the esc key. This mode is the most unfinished because I ran out of time to finish it. I may get around to working on it again but no promises.</p>\n<p>All animations for the weapons, boxes and doors\u00a0where made by me. The weapon models where also made by me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T14:18:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9eb3ca0abb47a11e6ab523d1bd267ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["C Smith"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
