Turns out Greek mythology is real though, and you end up on Charon's new and improved ship for the dead. He got so rich that he stopped caring about the coins under people's tongues, and now serves as the ship's captain and activities director. While on your voyage to the great beyond, Charon recommends you interact with your newly dead co-passengers and help them transition into the afterlife\u00a0to regain some karma. Hopefully, in doing so, you can avoid the eternal torment that lies ahead.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Use WASD to move, mouse to look, and E to interact with people and items.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Jake Crabtree (Design, Programming)</p>\n<p>Kevin Lam (tech art)</p>\n<p>Garrett Bishop (producer)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T11:23:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/eba417ded658bf63e6fe171cac8b6cad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jake Crabtree"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
