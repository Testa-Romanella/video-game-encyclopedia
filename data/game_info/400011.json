Spread throughout this \"mini golf \" course are holes. So get busy putting yourself into them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is a project I worked on for my Game Workshop class at Fitchburg State University. I used this assignment to further understand 3D modeling, especially 3D tools\u00a0in a game engine. Please forgive me if this game seems boring at the moment, I plan on revisiting Golf or Die later on to create a\u00a0more detailed level.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:32:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f99/f993fb151355ac3d77ba9f7dac5efbb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["John Puleio"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
