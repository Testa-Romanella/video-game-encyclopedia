This game takes on that form in a very literal sense, where the player has to shoot light from a start point at each level around a puzzle of objects that can't be seen until the light gets near it. The character controller uses the\u00a0Mathf.Atan2 equation to calculate the angle between the mouse and the lights starting point, allowing the player to fire the light ball anywhere they want. The ball and wall collision also use Unity's physics-based collision system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T07:07:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd1/fd118215fdf39cb33e22b1d447680588.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolarSnowball"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
