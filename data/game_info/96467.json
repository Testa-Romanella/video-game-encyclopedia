Also I added a quick restart option at game over.</p><p><strong>The year is </strong><em><strong>XXXX</strong></em><br/></p><p>You play the part of a new recruit; a \"volunteer\" taken by a mysterious corporation, placed aboard a fast moving ship and sent to the far reaches of our solar system. Your mission - to navigate through endless tunnels within planetoids in order to gather as many gems as you can.</p><p>Collect enough gems and a power-up will spawn. They're all helpful, don't be afraid of them.</p><p>A highscore game with a twist - you can end up with nothing. If you crash you lose the ship and all the gems within. <strong>You only keep your score by using your hyperdrive to jump to safety</strong>, but it takes 10 seconds to spool up and your ship is getting faster and faster... How long can you hold your nerve?</p><p><strong>Controls (PC):</strong></p><p>Gamepads supported (Xbox 360 and PS3 pads tested)</p><p>Movement - arrow keys | Analogue stick | D-pad</p><p>Activate Hyperdrive - spacebar | A (360) | X (PS3)</p><p>Pause - ESC | Start button</p><p>This is my first game, created using Game Maker: Studio as a hobby project rather than a \"serious\" attempt at making a game. It is in what I consider a finished state, but I do have ideas on how to expand the game further (using some sort of progression system, unlockable ships etc) so this may be updated in the future.<br/></p><p>Please let me know what you think of the game. I'd love feedback, positive or negative (fingers crossed that it's the former). You can reach me on Twitter @MrTom</p><p>Music is by BoBSwanS. Find him on Twitter @BobSwanS, or buy the soundtrack now on Bandcamp.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db72d86235d3e2e60c376656de894815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Bee Bush"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
