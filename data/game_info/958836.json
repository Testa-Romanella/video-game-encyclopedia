{"id": 958836, "slug": "the-coral-labyrinth", "name": "The Coral Labyrinth", "name_original": "The Coral Labyrinth", "description": "<p>Lost in a strange, enclosed world, you explore a series of interconnected rooms and get to know its inhabitants and secrets. Is there a way out? Will you even want to find it? What can you learn from the maze?</p>\n<p>This project began development during the first 2020 lockdown and expanded from there. Formally, this is only a demo: despite having two \"endings\", these are both just walls where I have more planned but decided to stop there for now. Even in this version, though, there are several stories and almost fifty rooms to explore.</p>\n<p>Each room has its own unique mechanic, and there are more interactions to discover as you get to know your way around the maze. For the most part, this is a gentle if disorientating adventure, though there are some larger mysteries to discover once you think you've seen every room. There is no built-in map feature, so I'd recommend\u00a0grabbing a pad or spreadsheet to make your own\u00a0notes. Figuring out the layout is part of the fun!</p>\n<p>Note that a later section of the game includes a strobe-like effect and some unsettling descriptions. If you don't wish to see this, when you activate the strange machinery in the laboratory, press the stop button there.</p>\n<p>Thanks\u00a0to my lovely friends Kate,\u00a0Gabe, and Ben\u00a0for playtesting!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T20:45:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c978efa25aafee9e066880e9e7859e37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Coral Nulla"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
