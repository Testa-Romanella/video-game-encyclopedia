In Low Poly Lap Racer you try to drive the fastest round ever.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Background Info:</p>\n<p>This is an unfinished fun project. It\u2019s not a full game with dozens of content. It\u2019s just one track, one car and a lap counter. However, it can be challenging and fun to give yourself some rounds and beat your best time.</p>\n<p>I modeled all the props in the game, including the car, house, nature and the track. And finally threw in some code to make it playable. I basically wanted to learn blender again and played around with my 3D models in Unity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<p>- <strong>Xbox Controller</strong>: joystick, A and X\u00a0for driving, Start button for restarting the game</p>\n<p>- <strong>Keyboard</strong>: arrow keys for driving, \u201er\u201c key for restarting the game</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all to know. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:28:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9a/c9a63bf4620503e8961ec538c49744b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["AlexGuenther"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
