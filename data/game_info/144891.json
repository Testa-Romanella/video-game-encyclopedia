I sure love sandwiches!!!<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>This is a quick, short game I made within about 2 hours? It's a bit of an abstract kind of text based game I made to try out a few ideas, but hopefully it's at least a little enjoyable!<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>Personal notes:<br/>I made this quickly, based on some of the issues I'm facing as I'm getting into the end of my first semester in college.</p><p>This is actually the first game I've made in a while, so take it easy on me? :p, lol. I am studying game design, though, so if you have any advice I'd love to hear it! Although the game is short, so it's probably hard to give much in depth critique!</p><p>I'm also a poor college student, so if you feel moved to donate, any amount at all, I would appreciate you and adore you foreeeeveeerr!</p><p>If there's anything you want to discuss, please, contact me! </p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>-Pineapple</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90978d4824b67998be3ecb5d1df9117.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PineapplePizza"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
