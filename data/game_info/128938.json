For the last level, hit the green weak spot on the bad guys van before the timer expires.</li><li>While your first reaction might be dodging frantically, the winning strategy is to find the safe areas and maneuver into them quickly and carefully.</li></ul>\n<p>To play, place the .PNG files in Pix64's \"Carts\" folder.</p>\n<p>Pix64 is a tiny Fantasy Console by <strong>ZappedCow</strong> - Download<br/></p>\n<p>Graphics based on 1-bit Cars by\u00a0<strong>pixelartm</strong> -\u00a0Open Game Art</p>\n<p>Made in 2 hours for the Fantasy Console Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb9/fb900a55934eb0dcaed70f8823b8bdea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiago R\u00b2"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
