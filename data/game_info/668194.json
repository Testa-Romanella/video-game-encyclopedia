This one is purely expansion focused, as have been the other ones.</p>\n<p>In Expansion Lab you find yourself mindlessly inflating countless \"subjects\" for no apparent reason! Now, this one has some\u00a0more complicated stuff than wasd and mouse for interacting with the world, so please read the following:</p><p>e - interact</p><p>hold space - inflate subject (only if the subject is on a harness, also there is virtually no size limit)</p>\n<p>1 - dart gun (will pop subjects)</p><p>2 - air gun (will push them around)</p>\n<p>SUSPENSION HARNESS - this will keep the subject in place (note that once the subject is off the harness,\u00a0they can no longer be inflated or put back on the harness and will bounce around)</p>\n<p>ROOF - simply closes or opens the roof</p>\n<p>GRAVITY HARNESS - if enabled subjects will stay grounded, if disabled inflated subjects will start to float</p>\n<p>TOP/BOTTOM - allows to take off/put on clothes (there is no explicit material, just smooth skin)</p>\n<p>WATER HOSE - will be added</p>\n<p>NEXT SUBJECT - puts the next subject on the harness, note that there is an unlimited amount of subjects\u00a0that can be present in a lab at the same time. Also, if there is already a subject on the harness, do not\u00a0add another one before taking the first one off</p>\n<p>RESET ALL SUBJECTS - if the game brakes or something this will delete all subjects</p>\n<p>I believe that is all, do share your thoughts about the game and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-24T05:25:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdfe3d375e2f2d5fc01c4872a22acf34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MadLad224"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
