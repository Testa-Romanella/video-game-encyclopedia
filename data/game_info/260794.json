No we're not joking, we really went from realistic horror to a cute animal mascot 3D Platforming game. We originally put the project on hold but as Billie Bust Up grew we no longer had time to continue working on this game (we're a very small team of recent graduates and this was our first big game)</p>\n<p><strong>Why upload the game now?</strong></p>\n<p>We spent a lot of our time and money on the game and despite cancelling the project we still love our creation. The entire game was produced by only 2 people, each asset was handmade\u00a0 by our team.\u00a0It seemed a shame to leave it stored on a digital shelf to gather dust so this seemed like the best option! We've also had multiple requests from old fans who never had a chance to play the game until now.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>How long is the game?</strong></p>\n<p>The prequel\u00a0has a defined start and end and was intended to serve as a prequel rather than a full game, it has around 30mins to 1 hour of content depending on the puzzle difficulty mode you chose and your past\u00a0experience with adventure games. Those who choose \"Anxiety\" mode will have a shorter playtime as most puzzles have been removed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What are the minimum requirements?</strong></p>\n<p>Here is the hardware we used to produce and run the game:</p>\n<p>NVIDIA Geforce GTX 760 2GB\u00a0</p>\n<p>16GB Memory</p>\n<p>Intel i7-4770K 3.50 GHz\u00a0</p>\n<p>We tried to build the game to be optimised as we could with the time frame we had for development (we were given 10 weeks to produce this demo for EGX), however we did not have time to run extensive testing on multiple hardware so the game could experience frame rate drops for older hardware.\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>I'm stuck on a puzzle?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>We have a handy walk through for you here!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Why is the game no longer receiving updates?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game was shelved in 2016\u00a0we have the old packaged files but the actual engine build is now gone so we can no longer work on it</p>\n<p><strong>Mac/Linux Build?</strong></p>\n<p>Due to not having a copy of the game in engine we can no longer compile new versions of the game</p>\n<p><strong>Any Cut Content?</strong></p>\n<p>Some areas of the game were cut due to bugs before EGX, although these areas are not functional they are still in game, feel free to explore by accessing the console</p>\n<p>press ` to open the console and type in \"ghost\" to explore out of bounds! We recommend you play the game through once first</p>\n<p>Have any further questions?
