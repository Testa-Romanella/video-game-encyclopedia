Her name was Penny Black, <br/>\r\na girl slightly shorter than most girls her age, with short black hair <br/>\r\nand bright blue eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo your surprise, she accepted your proposal! The meeting point was just <br/>\r\noutside the Soma Cinema Complex, Saturday at eleven o\u2019clock. This is where <br/>\r\nyour little adventure\u2026 or misadventure begins\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\tPenny Black plays similar to a traditional text adventure; type in certain words in order to progress the game.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\tMore than 25,000 words.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\t30 minutes \u2013 2 hours game time.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\tDifferent endings that are determined throughout certain choices.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\tHidden choices that could either spell success or disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n-\tA massive 200kb to install!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nKeep in mind that there is no save function, but it is relatively straightforward enough to remember the choices you made and progress through the story quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPenny Black is just a simple game I made in my spare time using BBC Basic for Windows. Though nothing special, I see it as a small step towards making better programs in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHope you enjoy the game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:55:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee3ff17ef58b1af0933d7debf91a95a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 114, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Zeal"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Bobby Zeal"], "esrb_rating": null}
