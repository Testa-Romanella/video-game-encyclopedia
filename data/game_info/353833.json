Are you a warrior? A rogue? A wizard, cleric or knight? The forces of chaos are laying siege to the realms. They will not stop until the world, and its people, lie in ashes. Ogres, orcs, dragons, even the dead themselves wander the land to spill the blood of the innocent.<br/>Standing against them are the HonorBound. Champions of the gods, these legends each embody one of the five elements - fiery Terra, wild Primal, celestial Lunar, pure Spirit and shrouded Abyss. Every cycle, an incarnation of the HonorBound is sent to stop evil and then slumber to regain their strength.<br/>But this cycle is different. This cycle is new.<br/>Awakened early in a land already wracked by chaos, you must raise an army, rebuild your powers and bring peace to the realm before it is too late.<br/>Will you answer the call?<br/><br/>Use of this application is governed by the JuiceBox Terms of Use.
