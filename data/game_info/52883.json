It was the first game developed by Cave, and the second on Cave&#39;s first generation arcade hardware (the first being Power Instinct 2). Literally translated, the title means &quot;leader bee&quot;, but it is also a Japanese onomatopoeic expression associated with the sound of firing guns. It is one of the first manic shooters.
