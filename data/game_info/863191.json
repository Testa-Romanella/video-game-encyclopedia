At your station you have the tools you need to disarm the bombs. As the new guy, you get the bombs which are close to detonation, they roll in on a conveyer belt pass your station, where you have to disarm them before the timer runs out and the bomb blows you up.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>LD51, first game jam, first attempt at pixel art, which took way longer than anticipated. Great fun, 10/10 will participate again.</p>\n<p>Project is working, but lacks audio amongst other things. The idea was to have more different kinds of bombs, animations and audio, however rl time constraints is a cruel mistress :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>All feedback appreciated :)</p>\n<p>//FreeRunner || EctoCat</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T19:32:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cca/ccaf0c579e3a75641b343209b110708c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EctoCat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
