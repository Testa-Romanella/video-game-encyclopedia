Eat all the food, which includes cherries, grapes,\u00a0blueberries and bugs, to grow longer. Some food leaves a nasty yellow mushroom. Don't eat mushrooms! Get the right combination of food and you will be rewarded with a Green Jelly bonus, the most excellent of all the Jellies.</p>\r\nStarting the game\r\n<p>Load it up on a real Commodore Vic 20 or by using an emulator such as VICE. See the Download &amp; Install Instructions for more on that.</p>\n<p>Once the game has loaded, start playing with one of the function keys; F1, F3, F5 or F7. These select the diffulty level. Pressing fire on the joystick will also start at the last difficulty level you selected.</p>\n<p>Control the snake with the WASD keys or a joystick.</p>\r\nHints and tips\r\n<p>When the game starts you are positioned at the top of the screen with food and mushrooms appearing around you. Get ready as you won't have long to become acquainted with your surroundings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Guide the snake around the screen avoiding the mushrooms and your own body.</p>\n<p>Eat all the food to progress through the wave. More food will appear when you have gobbled it all up until you get to the end of the wave, at which point you will have a bonus for each mushroom in play.</p>\n<p>Each wave will get harder by getting faster or more food to collect and mushrooms to avoid. Can you reach wave 5? Some say it is possible.</p>\n<p>Try eating one of each fruit to get a Green Jelly bonus. Green Jelly is the best kind of jelly and you will be rewarded handsomley.</p>\n<p>Finally, try playing on harder difficulty levels as these reward you with bigger scores for food and bonuses.</p>\r\nGet more snake\r\n<p>The game is 100% free to play and you can download it below.
