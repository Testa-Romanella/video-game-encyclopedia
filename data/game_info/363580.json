We settled on making a color-based puzzle game where there were multiple ways to traverse the radial world design.</p>\n<p>You control\u00a0<em>Pebble</em>, a small rock who propels through the water using air bubbles. You start in an underwater cave, and must find your way to the surface, escaping the cave.</p>\n<p>Clicking and holding the left mouse button\u00a0mouse pushes you away from the cursor,\u00a0and holding right mouse button will slowly release your accumulated color into the water.</p>\r\n(Click for gameplay spoilers.)\r\n<p>Unlock new areas by mixing the color your friends give you. Once your own color matches that of a ray of light, you can shatter a rock, and continue onward, unlocking new areas and friends.</p>\n<p>Different colors manifest with different physical properties, so you'll become heavier, or more buoyant, or more energetic, as you gain and mix colors.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T08:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15f/15f425e2c0eab795e0260cfe142cc15f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Noah Burkholder"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
