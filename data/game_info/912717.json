Kill zombies, earn points, buy upgrades, and survive as long as possible! Compete with friends in real life to see who can last the longest! This was a week-long solo project so some necessary features like player feedback, a main menu, and a tutorial are not present at the moment. This is strictly meant to be a fun proof of concept that I wanted others to be able to share with family and friends, but if I get some interest then I will add some features in the future to flesh it out!</p>\n<p><strong>Setup and Gameplay Notes:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Safety Notice:\u00a0</strong>Please be careful moving around your play space and keep in mind that <strong>you CANNOT run out through the virtual doors</strong>! Be mindful of your room-scale barrier since the only thing you can't see in this experience is what is actually behind the doors you outlined, so if there is a real door there and you try to peek out... you will bonk your head.</p>\n<p><strong>Room Setup:\u00a0</strong>You need to do room setup by going to settings on your oculus device, then click on \"Experimental\" (you may need to scroll down). Next, scroll down until you see \"Room Setup\". Click on this and follow the steps to define a room-scale play space as well as setting up your walls. Now that you have the basic room set up you need to add at least one door using the menu that is displayed while you are in Room Setup. Click on \"Door\", and then click to create a point on the wall before dragging to place the other side of the door. <strong>Important</strong> - Be sure that you make the door a bit wider than the average door, at least include the door frame and maybe make it a bit wider just to be sure the zombies can fit through. Once you place your doors, now if you want to you can select \"Volume\" (just referencing a solid box) from the menu options to outline your real-world objects. If you do this then the zombies will actually navigate around them as well as be occluded visually by the volumes (and walls) that overlap them (ie. hides their legs if they are on the other side of the table from you). Once you do this once in a given room you won't have to do it again unless you clear your room setup. Keep in mind that while you can save multiple room setups on the headset, there is a limit of 25 volumes between all of your rooms so you may have to clear guardian data every once in a while to continue fleshing out your rooms with objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:\u00a0</strong>Shoot with trigger, switching the gun to the left hand is not supported currently. The pistol will reload automatically when you run out of ammo, but you can start a reload early with the right grip button.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Shop and Watch UI:\u00a0</strong>To see what round you are on and how many points you have, look at the back of your left hand (like you are checking your watch). To open the shop, look at the left side of the pistol(point the left side of the gun towards the headset). To interact, just push the left controller into the white button next to the upgrade you want.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Shop Upgrades:\u00a0</strong>Damage increases the damage per shot of the pistol. Reload increases reload speed as well as the number of bullets in the clip. Stagger forces the zombies to slow down for a short time whenever you shoot them. Each upgrade lengths the duration and makes the effect stronger.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Health:\u00a0</strong>There is no UI that currently displays health, but you die after four hits from zombies and the game immediately restarts at wave one.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c1/2c1cc7e5b00a933b3a10aa794da1d2e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CosmicalyXR"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
