In the months leading up to it, he and I had begun working on a game together, but due to a busy college schedule and lack of funds, we had to put it on the backburner.</p>\n<p>In his memory, I think it's time to finish that game.\u00a0Charlie was insistent that\u00a0<strong>\"if anything bad ever happens to one of us, the other's gotta finish it.\"</strong></p>\n<p>I've attempted to start this project a number of times, under different names and perspectives, but the only way this feels right is to speak to my own experiences with grieving for him, while also presenting his vision to the best of my ability.\u00a0<strong>The Drowning Machine</strong> is the culmination of this project, with\u00a0<strong>Eulogy</strong> being the first of many excerpts creating a larger story.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Eulogy</strong> was created in 3 hours, using poetry written by Charlie that he provided before his passing.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Profit from The Drowning Machine will be donated to a Trans Lifeline in Charlie's honor</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Join The Warren, the official Rabbit Run Games Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/qYgSV2QZ</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter for regular updates:\u00a0</strong><strong>https://Twitter.com/RabbitRunDev\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T07:31:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c8/4c8b5919bdd1a7709199bd352fa0bc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rabbit Run Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
