Well... now you can find out for yourself! Play the dream of an Australian Shephard named Aspen (the bestest girl). Your goal is to round up all the sheep. The sheep are hard to herd. Also, Pesky frisbees fly by, and if they get too close, Aspen starts chasing them!</p>\n<p>The controls are quite simple:</p>\n<ul><li>Move - WASD</li><li>Bark - SPACE<ul><li>Barking forces sheep to speed up!</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Watch out for frisbees! Aspen can't control herself!<br/></strong></p><p>Chrome Users: Some of my friends have noted performance issues on the Chrome browsers.
