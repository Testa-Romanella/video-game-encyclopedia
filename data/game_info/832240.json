{"id": 832240, "slug": "2d-story", "name": "2D story", "name_original": "2D story", "description": "<p>Because this game is adapted from one of the chapters of the Chinese novel \"The Writings of Nan Yin Zhai\", I like the supernatural and very human story. The story is about a strange love story in feudal China where the heroine is a flower fairy who originally didn't believe in love but was moved by love in the human world and this ends up using her soul to restore light to a man's eyes while she disappears into the world.</p>\n<p>The final product is not exactly a game, as there is not much of a game structure or story line branching out. It is closer to an interactive novel. Because the main focus is on the focus. The painting style is beautiful, so I echoed it with a beautiful chinoiserie soundtrack.</p>\n<p>Of course there is still a lot of room for improvement in this little game, and I will continue to improve it if I have time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de1558aec83211ba35d1c38abafa859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 199, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["yzhou025"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
