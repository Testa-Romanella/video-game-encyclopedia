{"id": 541401, "slug": "legends-of-the-land", "name": "Legends of the Land", "name_original": "Legends of the Land", "description": "<p>I started working on this ZX Spectrum game in 1986, when I was in 6th grade primary school. Designing and coding it (I used assembly language at that time) took me more than 3 years, so I only finished it after having started high school in 88/89. By that time, the games market for speccy was in heavy decline. Even though a fairly known publisher at that time, Mastertronic, had shown interest in the game and we started to negotiate about its release, the company sadly went under water pretty soon afterwards.</p>\n<p>The game leaked onto internet around 95 when spectrum emulators became more widely available, so I officially released it as public domain then: World of Spectrum. But I never got to actually making some kind of a page or site for it. So I now finally decided to do it here.</p>\n<p>The instruction manual is included in the zip file. I have to apologise for the game's interface quirks in advance, but try to realise it is now almost 30 years old, and it was made by a 15 year old kid. For example, the only method back then that I could find for slowing down player input (in menus etc) was to play a \"magic sound sample\", a brief buzz that is played in response to each keyboard input. The menus are also \"infinite\" and have to be manually scrolled \"next page\" style.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was also pretty revolutionary for that time. A brief list of features follows:</p>\n<ul><li>The game sported more than 2500 locations and 10000 possible views. Yes, it was achieved with landscaping technology invented by Mike Singleton. But I improved it by crossing it over with image scale and RLE compression algorithems to conserve a HUGE amount of space that I could then fill up with content. This game had more content than any 8 bit RPG of that time.</li><li>Entirely nonlinear solution. All problems could either be solved strategically (on the field of war), by stealth, or through adventuring means &amp; questing.</li><li>Stealth mechanics allowing player not only fight their way around but sneak as well.</li><li>Open world with survival mechanics. Gather food, build campfires to chase monsters away, travel by boat, horse, ride a dragon, let giants carry you around.</li><li>Spells that alter storyline, help you solving puzzles, turn enemies or even monsters to your side, alter the terrain, teleport around.</li><li>Items that are quest items and weapons at the same time, and may be used in tactical or adventuring part of the game, or both.</li><li>Creating multi character parties and sending them around on various quests. Allowing stronger characters to protect more important ones in battles.</li><li>Night &amp; day cycle with various effects on gameplay and even the storyline.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T03:03:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf18b60355530f3ca93d15c188fa216.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["charon@ss"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
