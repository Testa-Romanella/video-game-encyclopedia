Presenting to you\u2026</p>\n<p><strong><em>EVORIA</em></strong></p>\n<p>After an unfortunate circumstance, thief Renee Rousseau and princess Naomi Nakano are forced to go on a journey to return to the castle. Along the way, the two learn more about the ancient legend of the kingdom, people with a magically large stomach capacity- the Knights of Evoria! On the journey, they\u2019ll meet crazy shop keeps, Scottish fairies, delicious slimes, and tons of other wacky characters!</p>\n<p>So far, the game is around two hours of stuffing-centric adventures with lots of burps and a good smattering of vore thrown in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All art in this game is done by the perpetually amazing SeaBea! Thank you SeaBea for all your help on the game, this project wouldn't be what it is without you!</p>\n<p>This is my first foray into game development, so if there are any bugs or things that could be done better, let me know! I\u2019ve got a lot of crazy ideas for where to take this, and I\u2019m super excited to keep working on this project!</p>\n<p><strong><em>~~~~~~CHAPTER 2~~~~~~</em></strong></p>\n<p>Holy cow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's the Evoria Chapter 2 update!</p>\n<p>The first thing you'll notice is that there's real art for the game now!!! Wow!!!! Thank SeaBea for that, all of this amazing and wonderful art was done by him! I am incredibly lucky to have someone like him working with me on this project, he's really helped turn this into something wonderful!</p>\n<p>Along with adding in all the new story stuff for Chapter 2, there's also a lot of changes to Chapter 1 in this update, including:</p>\n<p>- The Adventurer's Database is a working encyclopedia now!! Use it on the Key Items screen to get fun flavor text about people and foods and stuff!</p>\n<p>- I redrew a bunch of older maps to make stuff look nicer!</p>\n<p>- UI changes! Stuff should look and sound a little more sleek!</p>\n<p>- New battle music!! Anyone who recognizes where it's from is certified cool!</p>\n<p>- There are more hidden chests around, containing cute little postcards for different in-game locations!</p>\n<p>- SeaBea drew a whole bunch of really cool art and pop-up pictures for Chapter 1!!! They're amazing!!!!</p>\n<p>Because of all these changes and tweaks, I -strongly- recommend replaying from the beginning, if you just wanna get to the new stuff, I understand, but there's really a loottt of good Chapter 1 content you'd be missing out on. I promise this is the only time I'll ask you to start from the beginning, too!</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 is, from what I've got planned so far, the most important chapter when it comes to laying out what the story is gonna be like. There's a lot of moving parts here, and I really hope you guys like the direction I'm heading with this! Things are getting interesting!</p>\n<p>Thanks again to SeaBea for the art, Evoria really wouldn't be what it is without him!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!!</p>\n<p>-F.P.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:30:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09b/09ba1df400c9172f506463a1f2993a06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["forotherpurposes"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
