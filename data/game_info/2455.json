Battle other players online controlling huge space fleets ranging from small fighters to gigantic battlecruisers. Play the single player campaign or train against the AI.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Galactic Conflict is a competitive SciFi RTS with a gameplay similar to Starcraft or Command &amp; Conquer. You start out on your homeworld, build up your economy to gain valuable resources to research better technology and of course an impressive space fleet. Conquer new planets to expand your influence and increase your income and use your strategic thinking and perfect execution to ultimately defeat your opponents \u2013 either online or against the AI.<br/><br/>Galactic Conflict was explicitly developed for tablets but brings real time strategy on a scale previously unseen on mobile devices. You can literally control hundreds of space ships at the same time. Ships come at all sizes: watch small fighters and corvettes dog-fighting for strikecraft supremacy, bombers swarming enemy ships, frigates hypering in to lay waste to an enemy planet or unleash the tremendous firepower of the huge capital ships.<br/><br/>SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN<br/><br/>Enjoy the single player campaign where the Terran Confederation\u2019s home planet has been attacked by the mysterious Pyros race without prior notice. Only a small fleet of Terrans could survive the cowardly attack and they are now on the run. Join the terran space fleet in 12 immersive missions, help protect the only survivors of the human race and find the best strategies to repel the invaders.<br/><br/>SKIRMISH AGAINST THE AI<br/><br/>Play against AI opponents in four different difficulty settings in numerous galaxies to shape up for multiplayer. Experiment with new strategies, learn your preferred race and work on your timings to outsmart the opponent.<br/><br/>INTENSIVE MULTIPLAYER ACTION<br/><br/>Challenge your friends in a 1v1 or 2v2 on Game Center or get automatically matched to other players on the Internet. Let\u2019s face it: nothing beats the excitement of playing real people. This opens up an infinite variety of strategies for endless replayability. Can you gain #1 on the Game Center leaderboards?<br/><br/>GAME BALANCE<br/><br/>Galactic Conflict features two distinct races each having 13 different space ships. It is easy to control on a touch device even for newcomers to strategy games but still provides good strategic depth for real-time strategy fans.
