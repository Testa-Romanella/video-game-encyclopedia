{"id": 716345, "slug": "type-crawl-20", "name": "Type Crawl 2.0", "name_original": "Type Crawl 2.0", "description": "<p>A complete rewrite/remake/overhaul of the original Type Crawl, this \"game\" gives you a better-looking, much more quality-of-life-having simulation experience in which you type words and then ending the words sends them slowly off the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>The title of this program might make it sound like it's merely an update to the simulation I made in 2018 called \"Type Crawl\", but it is in fact a new program built on top of nothing, \"made entirely\" in late-2021. The program is a silly gimmick toy that has the same mechanic as the original one but with higher quality and better allure, so the name \"Type Crawl 2.0\" always seemed to me as an appropriate and vaguely humourous honour to give it, even though it does not use the same code.</p>\n<p>This program is something you can play with, for... <em>fun</em>, but it is also something you can play <em>through</em>, if you are to figure out how. If you don't see a kind of mindless screwing-around appeal in watching what you type float away and disappear forever, perhaps you could try a kind of ultra-cryptic text-based journey that's hidden behind the brick-coloured wall.</p>\n\n<p>This game is made and presented late in 2021 because Hindbodes really wanted to have two games released in one year again for once and the original plan for that in 2021 turned out to be something that takes too much time to finish. That original plan is a secret sequel and still a game that's still intended to see its finish, especially seeing as it was teased to whatever meagerly-sized audience the creator was reaching online <em>a lot</em> in its earlier stages of development news. Hopefully this program - <em>Type Crawl 2.0</em> - that ranges from unusual to downright absurd - can keep everybody with an impatient waiting brain busy until the real Hindbodes kicks into gear. Much ado about better Hindbodes games is coming.</p>\n<p>Type Crawl 2.0 also comes with this lovely icon file!</p>\n\n<p>You know, if that icon file actually did not install into the EXE or app file, I'm gonna be so mad...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T06:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a7333c37760c721f2e5eb6e90f21e120.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Hindbodes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
