(moodboard below)</em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What was your biggest hurdle?<br/></strong><em>A: For programming -\u00a0bullet patterns in 2.5D perspective proved especially difficult. Molly used some heavy trigonometry magic to get it to work. For art - lack of experience in perspective-based game drawing (and not being a 2D artist). This was a growing experience for all of us!</em></p>\n\n<p>\u250f\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u0f3b\u2741\u0f3a\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2513</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse &amp; Keyboard required.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0- WASD to move<br/>-\u00a0 LMB / E\u00a0to attack<br/>-\u00a0 LSHIFT / [SPACE] to dodge</p>\n<p>\u2517\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u0f3b\u2741\u0f3a\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u251b\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Rhel's Soup Service:</strong></p>\n<p>Molly Price - Programming, narrative\r\n<br/>\r\nWilliam Rose\u00a0- Programming, cheerleading\r\n<br/>\r\nMigle Ignotaite\u00a0- Art &amp; animation crafts</p>\n<p>(with Andrew Gold's \"Spooky Scary Skeletons\" music)<br/>Created for the\u00a02022 10:10 WIG Jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T06:42:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5e8f650de1e1ef33be626486c3d90a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nemozzz", "Migle Ignotaite", "m.price57"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
