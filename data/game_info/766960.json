Place carefully and many gods can become happy at once, place carelessly and they might throw an apocalyptic fit!</p>\n<p><strong>See if you can beat the Hardcore build, the true test of divine mediation!</strong> You'll need to juggle the requests of the 5 competing gods, strategize exactly who you interact with and when, and plan ahead to maximize your luck and advantage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good luck!
