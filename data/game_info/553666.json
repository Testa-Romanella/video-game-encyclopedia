Complete the challenges to receive your well-earned F**kFace certified baseball bat!<br/><br/>...so uh, real talk for a second:<br/></p>\n<p>This Virtual Reality experience is created for the HTC Vive. <br/>It features teleportation locomotion and a few very simple puzzles to be solved to win the coveted F**kFace Bat.
