It was developed and published by Electronic Arts for the Apple II and Commodore 64 computer systems. The game set itself apart by its Japanese flavor, immense game world and length of play.</p>\n<p>Deathlord has a world of 16 continents, 128 unique monsters, and twenty dungeons, yet fits on only 2 double-density 5\u00bc\" floppy disks as it compresses blocks of identical squares on a map.</p>\n<p>There is only one savegame slot, and the game frequently autosaves, by design, if the party moves to another location, or a party member dies. A party, once killed, needs a new party to resurrect them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:25:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d87b8d397423ebb53d5f7958fc68b0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 251, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "Apple II"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
