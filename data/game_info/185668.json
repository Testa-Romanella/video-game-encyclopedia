You detected some asteroids targeting your and the neighbouring stations. An easy task for the defence towers. If they only would have power...</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br/>==================</p>\n<p>Your goal is to protect the stations. To achieve this, you have to power the towers with energy. You get energy by finishing rounds on the racetrack. The faster the better. If you finish enough rounds and there are at least some stations left, you're victorious.</p>\n<p>Technical Details<br/>==================</p>\n<p>The game was made in Unity (https://unity3d.com/). This was our second time with Unity. We made all the graphics and models ourselves, using GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/) and Blender (https://www.blender.org/). All the sound effects were created with assets of the \u2018The #GameAudioGDC Bundle\u2019 (Part 3) (http://www.sonniss.com/gameaudiogdc2017/) or by ourselves. The music was created using Cubase (https://www.steinberg.net/de/shop/cubase.html).<br/></p>\n<p>Made by<br/>==================</p>\n<p>Skosnowich and Matjes</p>\n<p>Video of the first level<br/>==================</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65ddee8aa5b9ff2a9ac5d5e45065b4d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Skosnowich"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
