There is also a special event, which I will let you find for yourself how it works, but it is pretty self explanatory... YOU...SMASH...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T07:52:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f10/f102445814cf06dc0646c87b6584bb76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["dango07"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
