{"id": 884695, "slug": "portable-ops", "name": "Portable Ops", "name_original": "Portable Ops", "description": "You are a mercenary for hire in the modern combat theatre. Play online in tactical military ops battle scenarios. Enter battle with your team, upgrade your outpost, take on the Opposing Force to achieve your objectives. Game modes: Bombsite C4. Capture the Flag. Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUpgrade your base.<br/>\r\nAs your team gets kills or achieves objectives, you earn tactical points.  Use these points to upgrade your outpost/camp site. This includes additional weapon stashes. You may choose to upgrade your outpost defenses, such as constructing a large wall around your base.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOutfit your mercenary.<br/>\r\nCustomize your player model in many ways. Select the character body, customize the uniform or outfits. Level up your player to unlock more uniforms and character body styles.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustomize your weapons.<br/>\r\nSetup your default weapons with suppressors, flip stocks, sites and grips. Unlock additional customization paintjobs/skins and items as your earn Combat points and your player gains levels.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUtilize your environment.<br/>\r\nTactical use of your environment is encouraged. Lean around a corner to project your body. Destroy objects to distract enemies or to reveal positions. Pickup objects to use as cover or temporary shields while assaulting an enemy. Be thoughtful with your choices, as heavy objects will protect you more but also slows down your movement. A light object such as a crate usually only takes 1-2 rounds of fire but it doesn't really slow you down either.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTake position.<br/>\r\nSome areas are harder to get to but will provide superior fighting positions. Look up at that tower for snipers. Be wary of the long alley way for entrenched machine gunners. Prime sniper positions will provide you with an advantage over the main battlefield, but you will have a hard time keeping an eye on what's nearby. If you're camped out at the end of an alley, your kill zone is deadly... but once your position is known, watch out for stealth attacks or long range grenades.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T02:40:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfa/dfa18639548b50dc56deaf7e7abc858f.jpg", "website": "https://portableopsgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sean Ryan Smith", "Outlaw Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pixels Graphic Design"], "esrb_rating": null}
