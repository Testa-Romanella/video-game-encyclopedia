Said tower has many different rumors about it; climbing to the top will grant you any wish, no one who has entered the tower has ever come back the same as they left, there is actually no end to the tower, and it goes up endlessly. Many people have attempted to scale the tower, but it is said that no one has actually made it to the top before. With nothing left to lose, you and your party decide to test your luck and scale the tower.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>How to Play:\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Keyboard and Mouse:</p>\n<ul><li>Movement: WASD keys or Arrow keys</li><li>Attack: Mouse click or Space Bar</li></ul><p>How to start the game:</p><ul><li>Click play online (All players must click before a room is made)</li><li>Create a room\u00a0(only one person if playing with multiple people)</li><li>Once the room is made have everyone join it by clicking that room on the right</li><li>Have everyone click ready and enjoy</li><li>If playing a second round, a new room must be made and joined</li></ul>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Game Design and Development: Kebiruto</p>\n<p>Programing: Kebiruto</p>\n<p>Art: Szadi Art, Ansimuz, Nyknck, Jakub Varga</p>\n<p>Music: XDeviruchi</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: Mathew Columbo</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-21T00:31:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb7/fb79e88563cd81b1df947a0f3b7b6e05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kebiruto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
