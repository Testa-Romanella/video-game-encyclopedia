Use <strong>WASD</strong> or the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move around.</p>\n<p>2. Your task is to diffuse as many bombs that land in your territory as you can, before they explode and kill your tiles. To do so, you can either <strong>(a) catch them as they land</strong> or <strong>(b) if they've already landed on a tile, rush over to that tile quick!</strong></p>\n<p>3. Keep as many tiles alive as possible! Failure to keep at least around a third of the game board alive will result in a game over.</p>\n<p>4. To pause, press the <strong>Tab key</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy :)</p>\n<p><em>- RyGuyGamez</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Information:</strong></p>\n<p>If you like what I've put out so far or want to see any other projects I create in the future, you can check out my content\u00a0on these other sites:</p>\n<p><em>Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/ryguygamez/?hl=en</em></p>\n<p><em>YouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1h9myd6GewqDUh_dQnEnA</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T19:48:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/2266911adcb2df56efdc7c03e8906299.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyGuyGamez"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
