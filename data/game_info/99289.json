Swap the hexes just in time to catch stars of the same color, and fill up the grid to complete the level. Sounds easy at first, but later on increasingly complex star patterns emerge, and the hex grid gets larger as you work on harder planets. Your goal is to finish constructing the solar system by building each planet, accomplished by beating each level.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li>36 levels</li>\n<li>6 upgrades</li>\n<li>5 planets, 1 hidden</li>\n<li>1-3 hours of gameplay</li>\n<li>Windows/Mac/Linux builds, works on touchscreens</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tUpgrades:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Time Stop - Stops all star movements, to give you a few seconds to swap hexes freely</li>\n<li>Shield - Puts up a barrier around hexes to prevent them from being damaged by the opposite colored stars</li>\n<li>Shield Swap - Whenever you swap two of the hexes, it shields them both for a small amount of time</li>\n<li>Star Barrier - Produces a moving barrier that changes the color of the stars</li>\n<li>Hex Splash - When a hex is full, if it gets hit by the same color stars it will begin to fill adjacent hexes</li>\n<li>Star Sweeper - Clears all the stars on the screen</li>\n<br/>\n</ul><p>\r\n\t\tMechanics, Hexes, and Stars:\r\n\t</p><ul>\n<li>Click to swap hexes and catch stars of the same color and fill them up.
