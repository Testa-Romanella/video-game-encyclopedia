You'll have to endure for 25 days, until the reinforcements come. Your main weapon is a bow and accurate shot. Gradually you will be able to unlock other improvements and so you'll be better prepared for enemies.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/742/742dfb605e0e8ed539e59bac7c7d46ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 204, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Blair Barnes"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Blair Barnes"], "esrb_rating": null}
