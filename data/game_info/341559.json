It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within graph theory, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.</p>\n<p>Features\u00a0:</p>\n<p>-\u00a0A* Algorithm</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Dijkstra's Algorithm</p>\n<p>-\u00a0Greedy\u00a0Best First Search Algorithm</p>\n<p>- Breadth First Search Algorithm</p>\n<p>This project was created for assignment purpose.\u00a0The\u00a0assets in this game are built with zero funding and captured from unity default sprites and self-drawn .\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T05:35:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/618c9493b7adc2d5afde4d567cdea78a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["StevannusLake"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
