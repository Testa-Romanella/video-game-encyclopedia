But just be careful when and how long to use Lampy\u2019s light!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>To use the street lamp\u2019s light just click and hold on Lampy or on the light button. The longer you hold more the points you will receive (if there are any pedestrians under the lamp). But be careful, if the bar above the pedestrians goes full \u2013 you will lose points!</p>\n<p>Beware the angry birds! Some of the birds may carry bombs\u2026 which if reach our street lamp \u2013 game over. So just click on those bad birds to kill them! But just try to not click on each and every bird you see as some of them may actually carry a present with points (which is actually very helpful to reach the minimum score to pass). Clicking on birds will cause to drop whatever they carry right below them\u2026 so if this something is a bomb \u2013 it will kill whatever is there.</p>\n<p>Lightnings! Be carefull of those as they actually like our Lampy! In other words \u2013 if a lightning strikes our street lamp while your light is on \u2013 it will electrocute the pedestrians under Lampy, which will kill them and you will lose points. But on the bright side when the storm is active you receive 3x score!</p>\n<p>Also we\u2019ve added a coins converter. Convert silver coins from your account in the website to lamp coins (in-game currency) or the other way around lamp coins to silver coins!</p>\n<p>For more information or just to play it directy - visit our website endverse.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/956/956587956a9f6c2983ab9a432f1ea240.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Endverse"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
