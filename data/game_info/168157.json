Its dream is to live forever, but that proves easier said than done when sharks, piranhas, octopuses, and more are everywhere and hungry for some Jelatin! Defend yourself through 30+ levels by fending off enemies with your shock attack. Eat plankton for points! Help those in need!</p>\n<p>Immortality is earned, not given.</p>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed playing Immortal, please consider donating. Donating will allow me to compensate my game's official testers and the artists who work on the sprite and background art. In addition, donations will make it easier for me to purchase booths at conventions such as ComicCon to display them there.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4c/c4cf601d73d3e01ef5d82f40d7da812a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GabeTheDeadFish"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
