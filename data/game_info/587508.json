Player, an evil mage, aims to destroy the world.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>This game was created in Godot Engine. Font used is OFL-licensed Atma (see the Font folder in the source code).</p>Guide to world domination<p>Grab a friend you want to completely obliterate (in the game ofcourse) and start playing. You can play either locally (use default IP of 127.0.0.1) or via network (port 30000 must be open). After creating and joining the server, you are greated with plain lands of the world. The first phase begins!</p><p>In the middle, there is a 5x5 board where all the action takes place. On the left side you can see your inventory with available items you can use to change the world to your evil liking. Right now, only a <em>Skull </em>is available.</p><p>This item lets you grow your deadly empire. Drag and drop it with your mouse to one of the tiles. The tile should transform into a wasteland, your home. If nothing happened, try draging it to a different tile - you selected the same tile as your opponent</p><p>In the next round, new items show up. These magical substances let you completely transform the world. Try to drag a <em>Stone </em>on any tile!</p><p>The tile transforms from plains to a rocky land. If you want to undo the change, you can drag the <em>Coin </em>on the same tile in the next round. This is where the rock-paper-scissors concept comes into play. On the right side of the screen, you can see a guide that shows relations between essences. Use this to your advantage and transform the land to your liking.</p><p>Each land can be upgraded by the seleted essence up to three times. Your opponent might want to destroy your precious doing, but fear not! You can easily counter his try by simply draging the specific essence to the tile you want to protect. Suppose you have a tile with <em>Stones</em>. Your opponent wants to destroy them by draging the <em>Coin </em>item on top of it. You can counter his move by draging <em>Plant </em>on your <em>Stone </em>tile.</p><p>Even though this game is turn-based, the actual turns happen in the same time. So when both players select the same tile with two different items, one of them is selected according to the item relations guide, and this item is <em>then </em>used on the tile itself.</p><p>In the example above, <em>Plant </em>wins over the <em>Coin</em>, then <em>Plant </em>is put on top of the <em>Stone</em> tile. The <em>Stone </em>is stronger than <em>Plant</em>, therefore nothing happens! Think strategically and ahead of time to best your opponent.</p><p>You might have noticed there are some weirdly looking things spawning on top of the three times upgraded tiles. In fact, it spawns there every round if the tile has no <em>Army</em>.<br/></p><p>These are called <em>Armies</em>. There are actually three types of units, the <em>Army</em>, the player's <em>Mage </em>and the opponent's <em>Mage</em>. Both mages will spawn after depleting all your items and entering the next phase of the game.</p><p>These <em>Mages </em>are your most important unit. They have health bar that just appeared on the left side of the screen. They can move around the board. Just drag and drop them to the neighboring tiles. Both can stay on the same tile at the same time. You need to move your <em>Mage </em>to be able to collect resources. All you need to do is to drag the <em>Hand </em>item on top of your <em>Mage</em>.</p><p>The blue <em>Mage </em>collected some resources. Items collected depend on the tile type and ownership. As you can see, the blue <em>Mage </em>is standing on the <em>Plant </em>tile that is owned by him. Therefore, he gained one <em>Plant </em>and one <em>Death </em>essence.</p><p>Beware! In this phase, you can only use <em>Death </em>essence on the tile you are standing on with your <em>Mage</em>, and this tile has to be empty!</p><p>Now, why would you need to gain additional territories? And what are those <em>Armies</em> for? As I mentioned before, the three times upgraded tile generates an <em>Army</em>. The type of the <em>Army </em>depend not only on the type of the tile, but also on the ownership. The previous green <em>Eagle </em>is spawned on top of the <em>Plant </em>land that isn't owned by anyone. That means, <em>Eagle </em>is a neutral unit that can't move anywhere, but it can kill your <em>Armies </em>or even damage your <em>Mage</em>! The same rock-paper-scissors rules apply here. The new guide just showed up on the right side of the screen.</p><p>If the <em>Army </em>has a green color, that means it is neutral. The blue <em>Army </em>is yours and the red one is opponent's. You can take advantage of these relations to overwhelm your opponent and kill his <em>Mage</em>, which is the ultimate goal of this game. Corresponding <em>Army </em>spawns on top of the specific three times upgraded tile. But beware (once again)! Undead <em>Armies </em>cannot stay on neutral tile for longer than one round, so be sure to contaminate the whole world.</p><p>Same rules for moves of various armies on the same tile apply. Additionaly, moving the <em>Army </em>on top of another one that is of the same time results in both <em>Armies</em> disappearing.</p><p>I hope you will have fun playing this!
