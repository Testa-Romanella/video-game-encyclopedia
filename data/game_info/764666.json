Beginning in Ancient Maya, Glitch will visit other distant lands and eras; each with their own unique aesthetic and challenges. <br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Start in one place in a level and get to another by running, crouching, and jumping. Deceptively simple. There are very few natural pathways for Glitch. The player must select different platforms and powerups then place them throughout the level then guide Glitch through the path they have chosen. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Numerous and increasingly challenging hazards inhibit your progress, however. You are also limited by how much energy in your overall pool and energy cost of each placed platform or powerup. Each level you complete, and cosmic gem you collect,  increases your energy pool and, potentially, unlocks a new tool.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Played using a mouse &amp; keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Platforming Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Left Arrow &amp; Right Arrow - move left and right</li><li>Down Arrow - crouch</li><li>Space - jump</li><li>Shift - open Creation mode</li><li>ESC - open menu</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Creation Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Right Click platform selection or powerup to select</li><li>Left Click to place platform or powerup</li><li>Right Click platoform to delete and refund energy</li><li>Touch Creation mode sides to scroll camera</li><li>C - reset camera</li><li>Shift - exit Creation mode</li><li>ESC - open menu</li></ul>\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-05T08:14:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39b/39bba414e92099a01e0d85ff258483b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Game Brewery"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
