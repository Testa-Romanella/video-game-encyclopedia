My first ever game Jam.</p>\n<p>It is controlled using one button (space). But for accessibility you can also use the mouse button, touchscreen or a game pad button.<br/></p>\n<p>It has only 2 short levels but they have very different game play, so make sure to check out both. Also there is a hidden Easter egg. Can you find it?<br/></p>\n<p>The HTML5 Version might have performance Issus and take a while to load. So please consider the download version for linux or windows (sorry no mac).<br/></p>\n<p>Thank you for playing! Please leave a comment and rating if you like the game :)</p>\n<p>CHEATS:</p><p>Hey there, if you get stuck in level 1 because it is to difficult, you can press 0 (zero) and it will teleport you close to the end of level 1. Level 2 features different game play (but it might be even more difficult) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T04:06:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c7a/c7a82a7d4b036e692a9f71d3e2901493.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["RedoxGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
