The player is initially presented with a world map, from which a country is chosen and played one at a time. The game is played by marking all tiles under which a mine is hidden with a flag and freeing up all tiles that do not have a mine underneath. If a tile containing a mine is revealed instead of being marked with a flag, the player loses the game. The digit displayed in tiles indicate the number of mines adjacent.<br/><br/><br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1394480/Roccos_Island_Ring_to_End_the_Pain/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T05:44:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aac/aac2f42374be24725e648d1551e79daa.jpg", "website": "https://www.teamcogoo.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Cogoo"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["Cogoo"], "esrb_rating": null}
