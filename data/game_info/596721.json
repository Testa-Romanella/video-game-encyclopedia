{"id": 596721, "slug": "gelatin-silver", "name": "Gelatin Silver", "name_original": "Gelatin Silver", "description": "<p>Gelatin Silver is an experimental game made as part of a Master Thesis in Games. The game takes between 5 - 10 minutes to complete and requires a controller (PS4, XBox, etc.) to play. After finishing the game, we will take you to a questionnaire that should take no longer than 10 - 15 minutes. The questionnaire is of course optional, but we would greatly appreciate you taking the time to fill it out. Due to the game being part of a research project, we refrain from giving too much description of the game itself, as it could affect the results. We apologize for the ambiguity, but thank you for your interest. Feel free to share the project if you found it interesting, it would help us a lot.\r\n</p>\n<p>The project is made by Jonas Lundbye and Konrad Mampe. We are doing our master thesis together as a part of our Master`s Degree in Games and the IT-University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Should you wish to get in contact with us regarding this project, or any other matter, feel free to contact us at jklu@itu.dk (Jonas) or konm@itu.dk (Konrad).\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c6/9c6e58ddf746bf5373865cd6e30e4992.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Konrad Mampe", "Jonas Lundbye"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
