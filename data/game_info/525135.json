In an ancient forgotten temple, buried under a silent asleep world, a singular creature is born, last legacy of an antique ancestry of guardians of nature. His birth is the last chapter of a restoration opus having its roots in times no one (or almost) has memory of anymore... Guided by his sole instinct, the\u00a0Bearer\u00a0takes up the\u00a0Pothorn\u00a0which was always destined to him, and embarks in a journey to discover a\u00a0vast land surrounded by nature, looking for the\u00a0last miraculous seeds\u00a0able to grow into flowers.    In a world suspended in eternal, verdant limbo, populated with the poor remains of a civilization without memory and strange hermits, the Bearer is called to travel valleys and untangle among ruins from the past, climb mountains and descend into caves, collect the precious seeds, grow them in his Pothorn and take care of the last flowers yielded by nature.</strong></p>\r\n\u00a0PLAY THE DEMO!\r\n<p><strong>Just download the archive, unzip it and open the Florifer.exe file.
