The location of the mines is discovered by a process of logic. Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank but some contain numbers (1 to 8), each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square. To help avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it with the right mouse button. The game is won once all blank squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine, any remaining mines not identified by flags being automatically flagged by the device. However, in the event that a game is lost and the player mistakenly flags a safe square, that square will either appear with a red X covering the mine (denoting it as safe), or just a red X (also denoting it as safe). <br/>    The game is played on a easy, medium and difficult  boxes arranged at random matrix of a certain amount of mines (easy to 8 , medium for the 15 and difficult as 22. Open box one by one by the players to find out all the mines as the ultimate goal of the game. If the player opened the box there are mines, the mine booms and the game is over.<br/>\u3000The goal of the game as soon as mine is not to find all the mines in mined areas of the box, and not allowed to step on mines. The figures point to open a few, then the number 8 position in the next several mines, if dug the mines, it will lose the game.All the mines will boom and you have to play it again.If you find all the mines, the game will congratulate you.<br/>      The game is simple and fun. It brings you to the young time. Please play this game and feel the young time you have experienced. Have a nice and wonderful time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:02:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a0/1a0130084acf296d86864957109ce6d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["yan Xing"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["yan Xing"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
