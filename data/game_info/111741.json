This two-player game was originally produced\u00a0for an indie arcade cabinet, spotlighting the work of\u00a0queer and trans game developers in NYC.\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Meteors are headed for Earth, and our thoughts &amp; prayers won't stop them! But you and your ally can work together to connect pairs of satellites and create protective barriers. Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol><li>When you see a meteor (or meteor warning), move towards a <strong>satellite of the same color</strong>.</li><li>Grab the satellite to hold it in place. <strong>Don't let go!</strong></li><li>Now the other player should <strong>grab a matching satellite.</strong></li><li>When both players are holding satellites, you're almost done! <strong>Create a connection</strong>, then release your hold.</li><li>Connections <strong>can't cross Earth.</strong></li><li>Connections will destroy a meteor of the same color, but they're only <strong>one-time use</strong>, so remember to keep making more!</li></ol>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move = <strong>W-A-S-D</strong> (player 1) / <strong>arrow keys</strong> (player 2)</p>\n<p>Grab satellite = Press &amp; hold\u00a0<strong>C</strong> (player 1) / <strong>M</strong>\u00a0(player 2)</p>\n<p>Connect satellites = <strong>Space bar</strong> <em>(w</em><em>hen both players are grabbing satellites)</em></p>\n<p>End game = <strong>Backspace</strong> or <strong>click</strong></p>\r\nLevels\r\n<p>There are three difficulty settings, which you can choose on the title screen. (Either click the left and right arrows, or press the left and right arrow keys, when \"Start\" is selected.) On the easiest level, you will start with more health, and help messages will appear when you seem to be having trouble. On the harder levels, meteors will come faster and more frequently, and some will curve with gravity\u00a0(instead of moving straight). Whichever level you choose, the game will get more difficult the longer you play. So good luck!</p>\r\nSpecial thanks\r\n<p>...to Ayla, for her initiative, inspiration, and\u00a0help workshopping my game design</p>\n<p>...to Death By Audio Arcade &amp; The\u00a0Dreamhouse, for the awesome opportunity to showcase this game in a physical\u00a0arcade cabinet</p>\n<p>...to Emily B, for pairing\u00a0with me on adding gravity effects</p>\n<p>...and to all my wonderful, patient, and\u00a0insightful\u00a0playtesters (Phoebe, Danielle, Cameron, Steven, Ben, Bryan, Nicole, Sarah, Emily D, Elsa, Avni, my dad - and more)!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b1/4b1a4634c2029098145e4577b3baf2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ellie"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
