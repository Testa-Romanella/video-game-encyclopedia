I suppose this is one of those learning projects and I absolutely do not guarantee that this will go anywhere (though I might consider it). So far this is extremely unfinished and awful. There are hundreds of these on the platform, and I really only uploaded this so that I can have a bit of a timeline on versions of the game. To call this an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) is quite a stretch.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-11T08:17:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc4/bc470bef731f1841c73693426e5d78c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Havesomeslav"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
