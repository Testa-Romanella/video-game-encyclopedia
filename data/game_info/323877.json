{"id": 323877, "slug": "follow-an-audio-lead-game", "name": "Follow: An Audio Lead Game", "name_original": "Follow: An Audio Lead Game", "description": "<p>Third year Sound Art &amp; Design project</p>\n<p>This 3D video game is an investigation into the function of adaptive and interactive audio, involving the application of composing music within the restrains of musical compositional structures or \u201cforms\u201d. These forms consist of individual layers that musically support each other, that can be triggered in game by the player through navigating around the map and/or completing objectives in the game. This game explores how, by using \u00a0\u2018Parallel\u2019, \u2018Ornamental/Transitional\u2019 compositional forms\u00a0in mind,\u00a0 can be effective in providing the player with information to support progression, navigation around the experience and emotional encouragement. By deconstructing and adapting a composition,\u00a0the game soundtrack develops with as the player progresses.\r\n  </p>\n<p>This project gave me the opportunity to harness my interest in video game sound and to focus on the application of adaptive and interactive audio and a study of multiple musical structures. The research for the project gradually developed throughout the development stages of the game through periods of trail and error by conducting tests at each significant milestone. The heart of my research behind the musical area of the project came from the compositional forms and methods. The concept of \u2018vertical re-orchestration/parallel forms\u2019, which is the technique of \u201cmaintaining musical continuity while allowing for significant changes in texture and instrumentation\u201d\u00a0 allowed me to provide the player with information to support progression and to assist in navigation around the experience. I also used additional methods presented by Stevens &amp; Raybould such as the \u2018Ornamental Form\u2019. This is a musical sound effect, written in the same key as the sound track to acknowledge an event has taken place, eg: the success of finding a hidden gem. I used these flourishes to acknowledge an event having taken place through a musical phrase, which wasn\u2019t significant enough to warrant a whole new layer to be added. This form can be related to positive reinforcements, which is an important element within Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\u2019s concept \u2018Flow\u2019 (2000). Allowing my composition to recognise minor happenings through \u2018Ornamental Flourishes\u2019 to reward successful actions, work in synch with the cognitive theories behind the Human-Computer-Interaction, Spatial Sound. As well as non-sound related level design research (Galuzin, 2016).\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T06:20:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22d/22d5d89f4562a4b08a70b9909a2c7d54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["impey"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
