They require sunlight on their leaves and water on their roots to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMeanwhile, some nasty birds fly past you to offer \"encouraging\" words. As the trees grow, so must your resilience.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt should be noted that this is a difficult game, both from a puzzle and execution standpoint. I hope you find enjoyment in the challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Olly<br/>\r\nxxx", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4cc6420de7e2e019d8bc080ba30ae22.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Olly Whillans"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Olly Whillans"], "esrb_rating": null}
