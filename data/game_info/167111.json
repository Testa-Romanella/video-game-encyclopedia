I've made some minor improvements to the game, but other than that it is duplicated with much love. I have loved this game since I was a kid in the 80s, since this game came out in 1980.</p>\n<p>I have also shared the source code, it was made in Visual Studio 2017 using MonoGame 3.6.X. I'm very proud of my code, as I've learned so much over the years. I made a simple vector based-PO library for the game, or some may call it a simple game engine. Feel free to use it however you like. Even the letters and numbers are made using it.</p><p>You may also need the .NET 4.7 runtime, it can be downloaded here.</p><p>You can see the project GitHub web page here.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cbb06439ac7f9c3712011be05c73b97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Panther Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
