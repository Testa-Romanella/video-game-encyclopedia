Fire an arsenal full of realistic weapons from automatic pistols to sub-machine guns at drone targets and various attackers. Compete live on out-there multiplayer firing ranges and out-trash-talk your opponent.<br/><br/>Put your skills on display competing globally in a wide range of different shooting challenges. Use your shooting skills to survive a range of dangerous scenarios and trigger many gratuitous explosions. We're working hard to make the weapons handling as realistic as possible, but our focus is on out-there, open 180 degree ranges with lots of interactive targets and live multi-player. From this point on co-op modes, rescuing survivors etc. is easy to implement.<br/><br/>We are constantly adding new weapons and insane/stupid challenges.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the next Master Shot?
