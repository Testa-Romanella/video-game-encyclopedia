The theme was to mix game genres. The two main genres that I\u00a0tried to incorporate are an endless runner and a roguelike dungeon crawler.</p>\n<p>The dungeon never ends, and the enemies will get harder as your score gets higher!\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also collect coins from enemies you've killed that you can spend in the shop that the local wizard runs. He will spawn the shop when you have enough coins to purchase an upgrade from him.</p>\n<p>I am of course happy to receive any feedback or suggestions you might have about the game, but please keep in mind that I\u00a0created this game in less than 48 hours!</p>\n<p>I might continue to develop this game after the jam as ended.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T03:59:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/535/535480c1e0ea4bf0aebb6afb883ce613.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruby"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
