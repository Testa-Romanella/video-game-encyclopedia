When an accident happens leaving her on the edge of life and death, her fairy tale land becomes an all-encompassing reality.</p><p>I really appreciate feedback and it is vital to making this game as good as it can be. If you want to give feedback anonymously, it would be great if you could take a minute to answer this poll after you finish playing with the demo: http://strawpoll.me/6172714</p><p>If you are willing to take it one step further and tell me why you chose the option you did, you can send me an anonymous ask on tumblr: http://ellapsegame.tumblr.com/ask</p><p>or you can tweet me @abyssmicdreams</p><p>This is the early access demo for Ellapse! As of this latest update, the demo now includes everything it will have. I of course will still be updating with bug fixes if need be.</p><p>Important note, I have run through the game several times and cleaned up all the bugs I could find, but there may still be some! If you happen to find any, please let me know where they happened and what you were doing when they occurred.</p><p>IMPORTANT: If you are running Windows 10, there seems to be some compatibility issues. Keyboard control of movement may not work. If the game will not run at all, try setting the compatibility mode to an earlier version.</p><p>If you like the demo, be sure to follow my development blog! http://ellapsegame.tumblr.com/</p><p>Also be sure to check out Midnight Mind, the musician for Ellapse: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO7JWNITwjk-0mTHWafZzXA</p><p>Controls:</p><p>- WASD or arrow keys to move and hold SHIFT or R to run</p><p>- Left click on the floor to walk to that point, hold SHIFT or R to run</p><p>- Left click on objects to interact with them</p><p>- Right click on objects to look at them</p><p>- F for primary power/attack</p><p>- C for secondary power/defend</p><p>- ESC to open the menu</p><p>Changelog</p><p>Demo Discussion Page (feel free to post feedback, constructive criticism, and point out any bugs you find here)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af6aadec4973288c510e24c5d4ea039.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["HelixAbyss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
