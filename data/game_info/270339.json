The bashful pigs move via w for jump and ad for left and right. The weary wolfs move via the up arrow to jump and the left and right arrow to move left and right and shift to bring a great dash forward.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/668/6686cd7c45e0cde45225caa863666b90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JsStudiosGames"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
