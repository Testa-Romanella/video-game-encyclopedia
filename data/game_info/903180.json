This is, in fact, my first (functioning and built) game, and it was made with the help of the course by BlackThornProd (I highly request you checking them out). All the art is original, only the music is loyalty-free. I hope you enjoy and take care!</p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/></p><p>Use A and D to move left and right. Space will allow you to dash. Your goal is to not get hit by the falling meteors, and collect health potions. When your health depletes it's Game Over.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T05:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/245/245c4cdd8c00432694dd6b160d51c862.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DanielShine7"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
