The POMA changes at every level!</li><li>There's only one thief per level. The thief might be a liar, but being a liar does not make one a thief.</li><li>Characters will almost never incriminate themselves directly. You might have to figure out who is innocent instead, and rule out the thief by exclusion.</li><li>Entries in the POMA do not imply anything other than what is directly specified\u00a0.\u00a0For example in the following scenario:<br/> 1. The POMA says: <em>Has plant = liar</em><br/> 2. Ribbity has a plant<br/> 3. It follows that\u00a0Ribbity is a liar<br/> 4. In another room, Bob does NOT have a plant<br/> 5. Bob might be a liar, or he might not be - based on condition 1, we cannot tell. It might be possible to tell based on other entries in the manual.</li><li>Certain items are only found inside cabinets.
