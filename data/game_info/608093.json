Located near Capilla del\u00a0Monte, in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, this mountain is the most famous UFO-spotting location in all of Argentina, with thousands of tourists arriving each hear hoping to catch a glimpse of an alien spaceship. It is also, for understandable reason, a hippie hotspot.</p>\n<p>However, this Cast Away scenario\u00a0isn't about a nice vacation - it wouldn't be much of a Cast Away scenario if it were. In The Grand Uritorco you will be desperately making your way down from the summit, trudging through mud and snow, all while avoiding falls, hunger, thirst and, most importantly, being eaten or vaporized by an alien.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-24T07:12:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f91/f9172357fdd03c5fe6f68a0fd61c72a5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inkarmat"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
