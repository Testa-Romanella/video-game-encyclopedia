The tale of a little boy who just wants to eat grass without getting caught by his parents. Hold spacebar to eat grass, but don't get spotted.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for One Mechanic Game Jam 3, using Unity. It doesn't fit with any of the themes, but I thought the idea was funny. It probably isn't.</p>\n\n<p>Assets used / credits:<br/><br/>SithJester</p>\n<p>http://untamed.wild-refuge.net/rmxpresources.php?characters<br/></p>\n<p>TinyWorlds</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/forest-ambience<br/></p>\n<p>ArtisticDude</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/rpg-sound-pack<br/></p>\n<p>Macro</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/alarm-0<br/></p>\n<p>Daniel Linssen<br/>https://managore.itch.io/m5x7<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d3f037beda48ea3d8ab8553de7137b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alec's Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
