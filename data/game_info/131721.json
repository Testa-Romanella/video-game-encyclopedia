This is a rapidly made Prototype to test out an idea for a card games combat system. The game is meant to play more like a board game such as chess, checkers, or Go; rather than a TCG. Essentially I wanted to make a more complex version of the children's card game \"War\".</p><p>The game is played by dragging and dropping cards onto the grid with the mouse. I suggest reading the How To Play in the game to know how each card functions when you place it on the board.<br/></p><p>Each players deck is identical, containing:</p><ul><li>2 Wizards</li><li>2 Jesters</li><li>2 Captains</li><li>4 Assassins</li><li>4 Knights</li><li>6 Bards</li><li>10 Archers</li><li>10 Soldiers</li></ul><p>The art used in the cards are merely placeholder.<br/></p><p>Background Music is Half Past by The Hamster Alliance.
