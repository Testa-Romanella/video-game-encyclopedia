Stranded on a small island, these loving creatures multiply so fast that they run out of space to live. They use a set of 3 cannons salvaged from their wrecked ship to cannon themselves on to a bigger island but fail each time they try. So, they need your help ! Use your Life preserver and save them from drowning.<br/>Bonuses:<br/>Do combos, increase your save streak, pass difficulty levels - you will earn bonuses which will help you increase your score spectacularly !<br/>Challenges:<br/>Whenever they die too much, Heaven gets full and smites you with more and more bombs. Pass this with success and more points are to come.<br/>Tutorial System:<br/>A play tutorial is available. I recommend you try it before diving in the game. This game is not that easy to play.<br/><br/>P.S. Do not hit the bombs ! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e1c3122a23ddedecf1efb831fe4c5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["EcliPlay"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
