Ever since they gained hyper-intelligence, they've been plotting and scheming. No one knows what this means. Could they be preparing to exact revenge on humanity? You have have been chosen to raid the local spider base for secret documents that may help you figure out what those eight-legged fellows are thinking about; however, as you are about to set out on your mission, you realize that you aren't being given any weapons. You've been handed a prop gun that, while it looks and sounds like a real gun, doesn't actually fire any bullets. The prop gun will have to do. Fortunately, the spiders, while certainly quite intelligent, can be easily tricked. Can you scare them off and escape their base with the secret documents before they see through your facade?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Objective<br/></strong></p>\n<p>There are 4 secret documents hidden throughout the spider base. You have to find them all and escape. The spiders will try to stop you, but you can scare them off with your gun. However, they are observant. If you fire your gun directly at them, fire without faking a reload, or forget to fake recoil, they'll realize that your gun isn't real and attack you without hesitation. <br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<p>WASD or Arrow Keys - movement</p>\n<p>Space - Jump<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse - Look Around (flick up to fake recoil)<br/></p>\n<p>Left Click - Shoot</p>\n<p>R - Reload<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Shrub - Music and Modelling</p>\n<p>Mark - Programming and Modelling <br/></p>\n<p>Tung - Programming <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T09:39:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/520/520c99da37d20df41039d6dc8010949b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["botmark", "SADragonMaker", "SnubbishShrub"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
