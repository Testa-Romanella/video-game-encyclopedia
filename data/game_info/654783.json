You have three clients on your first day. Can you help them get unblocked and create the written work their hearts' desire? This game --\u00a0made in three days for inkJam 2021 with the theme \"you'll think of something\" --\u00a0is all about conversation, crafting, and creativity. (Also a handful of artistic liberties taken with Greek mythology.) We hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Writing, scripting, narrative design, and creative lead: Anna Washenko</p>\n<p>Programming, visuals, and systems design: Samuel Axon<br/></p>\n<p>----All game-breaking bugs are (hopefully?) fixed! If you're in the east or west peristasis and items to scry aren't showing up, just go into the dossier or inventory and they'll appear. We don't know why. Game dev! Please let us know if there are any other major breakages we missed. Thank you for playing! - Anna<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T14:15:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/971/971783a0ee0373fbd678c45329a7f177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nerd Date Night"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
