Visit spaceports for repairs you need, refuel and find a new contract to take on. Need a new crewmember because one of them died in an onboard accident? This is where you do it.</p>\n<p>Take to the stars, your new contract will guide you. Avoid the many dangers of space and safely make it to the next spaceport.</p>\n<p>Good luck Captain, you are going to need it!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>_______________________</strong></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>When starting the game, you will have the opportunity to log in via the ship's system. It will then recognize you as its correct owner, or captain and you will be able to correctly dock into the spaceport.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>_______________________</strong></p>\r\nSpaceport\r\n<p><strong>After arriving at the spaceport</strong>\u00a0you will have the opportunity to choose between 3 missions, which each have different requirements. Make sure you meet these since you cannot accept, or depart without them.</p>\n\n<p>When accepting the mission, you get the option to depart on your journey.

It is not unusual to encounter different hazards in space, and while your ship is fully functional, it is not top-notch.</p>\n<p>Make sure you eliminate any errors, or fires that might turn up by telling your crew to handle them.\u00a0While everyone can help, there are special occupations that your crewmates might have which will aid in reparation.</p>\n<p>In the\u00a0<strong>Reactor tab</strong>, there is a way to change the velocity of your travels, but be aware! this does not mean that your travels will be easier. There is a high risk that you will have to deal with too much at the same time.
