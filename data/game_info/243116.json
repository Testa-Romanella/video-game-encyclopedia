Compete in a number of minigames to be crowned the champion of the Primal Party!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Primal Party is a local multiplayer\u00a0party game that focuses on 2vs2 competition. Currently it features three game modes\u00a0Coin Rush (can also be played 1vs1),\u00a0Barrel Runners and Bamboozle Party as the final big game mode. A fourth mode has been in early development,\u00a0but is currently put on hold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n<p>Steal barrels with your tail, defend your loot against the other team and raiding knights or get on a greedy hunt for shiny trophies. But watch out for the falling fruits! Make use of the fruit`s explosive powers before your opponents do, to bamboozle them and achieve victory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even though Primal Party is easy to pick up, if you want to succeed you will need the proper bamboozling approach and the right teammate to be crowned Champion of the Primal Party!</p>\n<p><em>- Primal Party has been developed\u00a0for use\u00a0with\u00a0 controllers -</em></p>\n<p><strong>Future of Primal Party</strong></p>\n<p>Currently Primal Party's development of further modes is put on hold as the team is heading towards its next project.
