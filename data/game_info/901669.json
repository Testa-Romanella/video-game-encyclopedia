{"id": 901669, "slug": "curl-2", "name": "Curl!", "name_original": "Curl!", "description": "Curl! is a first-of-its-kind game, built from the ground up for accessibility including integrated control through brain-computer interface (BCI), switch-access or other input schemes in addition to traditional controllers.<br/><br/><br/><strong>CURLING IN SPACE!?!</strong><br/>It\u2019s a wacky mishmash of strategical sporting action that up to 4 players can enjoy. Slide ahead of your foes with a foolproof strategy. Weave each stone carefully down the ice to land victory in your orbit. Astound the crowd with explodinating, zappifying, and mind-discombobulating uber-cool super-stones! What\u2019s that? Curling doesn\u2019t have explosions? Sure, your primitive Earth curling might not, but Curl! does!<br/><br/><br/><strong>STRANGE PLACES AND SILLY FACES</strong><br/>The galaxy is a huge and wonderfully weird place. A zany lineup of competitors face off on all manner of slick sheets from across the universe! Try to hit the button on the tongue of a gigantic, homely space worm, or speed through the cosmos on the front of a comet!<br/><br/><br/><strong>WANT MORE HUMANS?</strong><br/>Play locally or online with up to 4 players! Form the ultimate duo and take on the galaxy\u2019s toughest competitors, or face off against each other in 1v1, 1v2, or 2v2 action!<br/><br/><br/><strong>INTEGRATED BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE TRAINING AND CONTROLS!</strong><br/>Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables individuals to control a computer using their thoughts. Curl! is the first of its kind to enable full BCI integration directly within the game, including headset connection, calibration, training, and direct thought-to-action play. To support community and local play between all players, multiple BCI headsets can be used to control separate characters on the same local computer.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SWITCH ACCESSIBLE MENUS AND UI</strong> Menus and UI systems designed for use via switch-scanning selection, compatible with simple BCI alternative access.<h3>BCI Specific Information:</h3><strong>BCI Headset Compatibility - </strong> Currently Curl! supports only headsets available through Emotiv. Additional headset support is planned in future updates. Players using a BCI headset should follow their device's specific installation instructions prior to use to use these features.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-30T05:14:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b05/b05f3f5f92e4a2bc135a38e54008b5a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bonspiel Games"], "genres": ["Sports", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["BCI Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
