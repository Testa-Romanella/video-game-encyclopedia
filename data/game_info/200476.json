{"id": 200476, "slug": "impromptu", "name": "Impromptu", "name_original": "Impromptu", "description": "<p>In music, an impromptu\u00a0is a short, free-form composition. In gaming,\u00a0Impromptu is a game of memory, melody, and rhythm.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>It starts out simple. Repeat a single note. But as the rounds go on, more note are added to the impromptu melodies. Before long, you'll find yourself prompted to replay entire impromptu songs! The closer you match the impromptu's rhythm, the more points you'll receive. Aim for all \"Perfects!\" and you're sure to beat the high score. But play carefully, you only get three tries to play the correct notes.</p>\n<p>While you can play Impromptu without sound by watching which notes are played, you'll have a much better experience and an easier time remembering the melodies if you play with the sound on!</p>\n<p>Scoring System: Perfect! = 20 points, Excellent! = 15 points, Great = 10 points, Good = 5 points, OK = 1 points</p>\n<p>Your score corresponds to how closely you match the rhythm of the impromptu. For instance, matching a note to within 0.15 seconds results in \"Perfect!\", while receiving \"Good\" only requires matching to within 0.6 seconds. A correct note will always receive at least \"OK\" regardless of how far off the rhythm is.</p>\n<p>Impromptu was created by a solo developer\u00a0for the Minimalist Jam 3. All design, code, and visuals were created by me\u00a0during the one week jam time. All sound was also created by me with the exception of the drum sequence in the main menu which was made by KeffyStay.\u00a0As per the jam requirements, only ten colors are used. The colors are black (#000000FF), white (#FFFFFFFF), grey (#454545FF), pink (#FB00FFFF), green (#00FF17FF), red (#FF0010FF), blue (#1E00FFFF), yellow (#FBFF00FF), purple (#A000F4FF), and orange (#FBA100FF).</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy playing!</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay Video:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d1/8d1a8c78816ab5ae8fd0b242135a9aa2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["scientistsarepeopletoo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
