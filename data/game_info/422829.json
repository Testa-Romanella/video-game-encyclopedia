One day, while working on your projects, something goes wrong and the laboratory falls into critical condition. Your leaders have advised that you evacuate to your vehicle as soon as possible for your own safety. However, system failures have had a peculiar effect on the lab. Many of the rooms contain strange obstacles, and some even contain hidden dangers not immediately apparent. Navigate the puzzles and pitfalls of this strange new laboratory to find your way to the parking lot so you can get out safely.</p>\n\n<p>This was a game design class project done at Drexel University.</p>\n\n<p>Team Members:</p>\n<p>Jake McKenna</p>\n<p>Rob Hartman</p>\n<p>Yugeng Lin</p>\n<p>Peng Chen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-27T06:13:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f68/f6828ae3dde1f686f81d7ce64fae9d62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jake1025"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
