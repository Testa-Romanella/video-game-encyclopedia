It is a fiction first rule set that encourages players to \"play to see what happens.\" In\u00a0<strong>Anti-Heroes</strong>, the rules are stripped down to the core for simplicity and flexibility. \u00a0Eight\u00a0categories of super powers make it easy to create nearly any type of character you want. \u00a0Characters with the same power can describe its manifestation and effects in very different ways. \u00a0For example, one anti-hero with the shapeshifter power may be able to stretch their arms and legs to incredible lengths, while another may use the power to shape their hands into sledgehammers.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Successfully funded on Kickstarter!</strong></p>\n<p>Current Status:\u00a0 Text complete.\u00a0 Includes full rules and a resource file containing the playbook (character sheet), team sheet, and rules summary.</p>\n<p>What's Next?
