You can explore cities, forest, mountains, plains and dungeons. You can fight monsters and become a hero.</p>\n<p>You will meet a wide variety of characters. Many will give you tasks and quests for valuable experience. You may be asked to help protect land, feed the hungry, heal the sick, make someone happy, solve a puzzle or simply lend a hand.</p>\n<p>Your character will develop and grow and with each new level up become stronger and better. With the money you acquire you can buy new items and improve your armour and weapons, trade with friends, or look for what other players are giving away in the 'community chest'.</p>\n<p>If you just want to fight that helps too - the cities could get overrun by monsters without you!</p>\n<p>So what are you waiting for? A whole new world awaits...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc0/dc0ba8137ac635796f8a29e3c5a42e0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 252, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["LibreModder"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
