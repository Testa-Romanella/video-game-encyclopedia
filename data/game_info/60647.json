{"id": 60647, "slug": "robot-wants-it-all", "name": "Robot Wants It All", "name_original": "Robot Wants It All", "description": "Robot wants stuff, so go get it for him! This game is a compilation of the original Robot Wants games from 2010: <strong>Robot Wants Kitty, Robot Wants Puppy, Robot Wants Fishy</strong>, and <strong>Robot Wants Ice Cream</strong>. In addition, it includes <strong>Robot Wants Y!?</strong>, a mini-game that was actually the main banner on the JayIsGames website for a while. And of course, Robot wouldn't be wanting it all if we didn't add <strong>Robot Wants Justice</strong>, a brand new Robot adventure!<br/><br/><strong>Robot Wants</strong> pioneered the \"mini-metroidvania\" concept - an adventure you play through over an hour or less, collecting the powerups you need to go from zero to Kitty along the way. And all with a clock ticking - speedruns are the goal!<br/><br/>Each of the included games includes 2 alternate maps (an \"Easy\" map, which sometimes is not so easy, but we guarantee it is short! And a \"Remix\" map, which is never easy, or quick), and there are also 12 Mutators which allow you to transform the way the game plays in a variety of helpful and horrible ways.<br/><br/><ul><li> Online high scores to compete with your friends - each unique combination of mutators has a separate high score table, so try to be the best at your specialty.<br/></li><li> The ultimate Metroidvania action - you can't even JUMP without first finding a power-up in some of these games.<br/></li><li> A massive shop full of features and game modes to unlock as you play (with space money, not real money. No IAP or DLC here)<br/></li><li> Extreme alien blasting in <strong>Robot Wants Kitty</strong><br/></li><li> Intense kitty-hurling action in <strong>Robot Wants Puppy</strong><br/></li><li> Psychotic mad bombing in <strong>Robot Wants Fishy</strong><br/></li><li> A unique combination of Metroidvania and RPG in <strong>Robot Wants Ice Cream</strong><br/></li><li> Serious puzzle-solving action in <strong>Robot Wants Y?!</strong><br/></li><li> Alien-smashing, air-dashing combos in <strong>Robot Wants Justice</strong></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/44d/44dcb8be483cb165a33dc56591ef509a.jpg", "website": "http://hamumu.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 24, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Hamumu Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hamumu Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
