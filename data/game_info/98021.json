We are a young team of people from all over the world who have randomly met online over our love for games and decided to make our own. This has been a great and impactful experience which has all of us grow together as people. We want to thank everyone who participated and plays the games made in this contest. <br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Only arms can use items, and only while in battle. Removed in 1.1, will be reimplemented in 2.0</li><li>If your head dies you die.</li><li>August is left-handed, so his right arm is weaker and less accurate. Use it to steady a weapon or dual-wield.</li><li>Try a different battle plan if something doesn't work.</li><li>Encounter rate too high in an area? Hit backspace to see the escape menu.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba8/ba84639c321f36f586e0477c691b128a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 245, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Eighth Exodus", "gudgames", "DustZero", "banebigguy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
