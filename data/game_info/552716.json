My name is Chris, I\u00a0am a senior at Punahou Highschool in Honolulu Hawaii. I was super excited to participate in my first game jam, and solo develop a\u00a0game from scratch for the first time. Aside from the audio, the main menu background, and the first level background, all of the assets in here are mine and were created from scratch. Again this is the first game I've made so I would love any feedback possible.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot from this Jam, I think my biggest take away from this was that my scope for the project was a little too large to be packed into a week, especially on top of school. If I\u00a0had more time I\u00a0would have liked to flesh out the core components a little more, add some levels, and a score counter at the end of each level. Right now I\u00a0primarily just have a proof of concept, but I am still super happy I stuck through it and worked on it relentlessly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As most of you will I plan on participating in more Game Jams in the future, to expand my skills and to lean new things. Overall this was a great experience and I\u00a0can't wait to do it again soon. Thank you Noah for making this possible!!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:08:35", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ChrispyKreme"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
