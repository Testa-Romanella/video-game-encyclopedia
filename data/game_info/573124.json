Wall-run, double-jump, use your wrist-mounted grappling hook to rush towards, disarm, or avoid enemies - and that\u2019s before your upgrades. Everything from your brain to your legs to your pet dog can be enhanced as you gather money from your contracts.</p>\n<p>Your cyber-mastiff is your only true companion - half-dog, half-robot, and ready to kill for you in exchange for treats. He warns you of enemies, can insta-kill them with a bite to the neck, and generally watches your back. In return, you can keep him hale and healthy with the best augments money can buy.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:07:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/759/7598ff65521e54fc58cb4578c5f2134c.jpg", "website": "https://www.focus-home.com/en-us/games/necromunda-hired-gun", "rating": 3.04, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 49, "owned": 770, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 69, "dropped": 36, "playing": 9}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 132, "ratings_count": 52, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Streum On Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": ["Focus Home Interactive", "Focus Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
