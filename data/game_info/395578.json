We make use of this property of space-time, plus our expendable employees, to run your future errands!</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, for only a handful of SpaceBucks, we will plunge into the far-flung future to deliver things on your behalf. Worried about forgetting your anniversary in 10 years? We\u2019re on it! Want to send a birthday present to your great-great-great-grand daughter? Look no further!</p>\n<p>With Relatively Special Deliveries, the future is now!</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------</p>\n<p><em>All trips are one-way, travelling back in time is not possible with our current understanding of physics. RSD is not responsible for any loss of goods or personnel due to cataclysmic future events.</em></p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>This game uses real physics to calculate the difference in time experienced by a stationary person and a person moving at near light speeds. This is called Time Dilation and was predicted by Einstein's Special Relativity.</p><p>Time dilation is calculated using the following:\u00a0</p><p>delta_t = delta_tau/(sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2)))\u00a0</p><p>where delta_t is the time on Earth, delta_tau is the time on the rocket, v is the speed of the rocket and c is the speed of light in a vaccuum.\u00a0</p><p>As the speed of the rocket approaches the speed of light, time slows down for them exponentially, allowing them to travel far into the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:21:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/589/589d0106dd6f2164820da22fe93f6991.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BethFromAbove"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
