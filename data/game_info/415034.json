The game will not make it easy for you, because it's broken! But don't worry, you can repair it.</p>\n<p>How can I repair it?</p>\n<p>This colorful block we call the Bug Fixer, you'll meet it on your way several times, maybe even a dozen. Its functionality is to remove in a medium radius Glitch Blocks and Spikes and Glitch Mobs. It also removes the random bug effect.</p>\n<p>What is Glitch Block?</p>\n<p>Glitch Block is very naughty block, that gives you a random bug effect. It can be different - from rotation of the screen by 180 degrees to total invertion of X axis. Be careful with this blocky thing.</p>\n<p>What is Glitch Mob?</p>\n<p>Glitch Mob is like Glitch Block, but more dangerous. The most important difference is that it can shoot you from the distance. After that, your character will get a random bug effect similar to Glitch Block's. Move often to dodge bullets from this guy.</p>\n<p>Spikes...? I'm actually scared right now.</p>\n<p>Don't be. Spikes can only kill your character if there is a collision between them. Try to avoid them unless you really like to kill your character.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something else I should know about?</p>\n<p>Hmm... I guess nothing else... no... wait. I forgot about Deadly Wall Of Bugs. I think that can be dangerous and very scary for you.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you the best. Beat your own records.
