A self-imposed personal game jam from us here at the Scythe Dev Team. It's a game within a game.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Remember the dev room in the garage at King's Comfort? This is what they were working on!</strong></em></p>\n<p>This crazy, ragdoll focused first person beat-em'-up takes place inside a retirement home. Fight your way past other old-folks, caretakers and some surprise guests as you try your best to escape!\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Ragdoll physics!</strong></li><li><strong>\u00a0Jon of the Shred OST!</strong></li><li><strong>Foley Sound Design that left bruises on our sound guy!</strong></li><li><strong>Breakable objects!</strong></li><li><strong>Scythe Saga Universe Tie-Ins!</strong></li><li><strong>Raunchy comedy!</strong></li><li><strong>A special satirical news report, \"Violence in Videogames,\" featuring the voice work of Kyle Brauch!</strong></li><li><strong>All of the bugs charm of a game finished inside of a week!</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Developed inside of a week, <strong>Senile Showdown: Arthfightus</strong> served as a much needed palette cleanser. As we moved onto a new stage of development with <strong>Walls Closing In</strong>, we needed a break. A momentary task to take us away, for a moment, from the unrelenting horror, gore, and bleak atmosphere of <strong>WCI</strong>.\u00a0<em>(Ever hear about Jack Nicholson going a bit crazy when he played the Joker? We're gonna assume that's legitimate.)<br/></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>We recommend a higher end PC to play, as there's thousands of physics calculations happening at once. A modern GPU and CPU should be sufficient.</strong><br/></em></p>\r\nHow To Play:\r\n<p><strong>WASD - Movement</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Left Click | Right Click - Left &amp; Right Punch</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shift - Sprint</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ctrl - Crouch<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Space - Jump</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest score possible before reaching the end. But beware, one slip and you could break a hip... Er, lose your score.</p>\n\n<p>The score is multiplied by destruction. So smash those young whippersnappers into submission!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Senile Showdown: Arthfightus</strong> has nods and Easter Eggs to many great fighting games in the past...well, as much as we could manage inside of a week. If there's enough interest, we can foresee this game getting some additional content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you like what you see, leave some feedback! We'll be developing much deeper 1st person fighting games based in the future, and welcome all feedback! Jump on our discord (discord.gg/scythesaga) and let your voice be heard! Stay tuned...</p>\n<p>And most importantly<br/><br/></p>\r\nPOST YOUR HIGH SCORES!\r\n<p>The game automatically takes a screenshot of your high score (assuming you beat the game!), check the root folder of the games files, we wanna see what you can do!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:29:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a63/a63a3266c9358e414d987a57b99de6ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 218, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scythe Dev Team"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
