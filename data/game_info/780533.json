Some of the aspects I used include live counters, PlayerPrefs, building and releasing to GitHub, and even some things I wasn't even taught in the class at all, like a functioning timer. The PlayerPrefs aspect in particular I felt was especially important to practice for this project, as I feel it could be very useful for any future projects where I want to incorporate something like a high score system.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T11:49:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a31/a314b49f072c395c82c6f5a5a3716336.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["RustyMew"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
