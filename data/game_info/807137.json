Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. The fabric of strait-laced Victorian society has begun to fray.<br/><br/>New Masters are in charge. Why are they so\u2026 tall? And always cloaked? And why are they so interested in love stories?<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>The possibilities for personal connection in London are different now. Thrown together in crisis, you might befriend or romance many of the characters you meet, from Griz, your assertive housemate for whom the Fall was a chance to break free of Victorian societal norms, to the infernally well-dressed gentleman at the Brass Consulate with the amber eyes.<br/><br/>Even death itself has a twist here: the first murder victim since the Fall is feeling much better, and keen to see justice done. Unfortunately, as the doctor who treated him immediately before he expired, your housemate Archie is the prime suspect...<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>(Re)invent yourself:</strong> who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?<br/></li><li><strong>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories</strong> to unlock different story options<br/></li><li><strong>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners</strong>, each with their own secrets<br/></li><li><strong>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself</strong> (by any definition you like)<br/></li><li><strong>Write love stories in a delightful minigame</strong>, and use them to impress the new Masters <br/></li><li><strong>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources.</strong> How are you at rat catching?<br/></li><li><strong>Solve the first murder since the Fall</strong>, with the assistance of the victim<br/></li><li><strong>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations</strong> in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London<br/></li><li><strong>Seek deeper and deeper secrets</strong> over multiple playthroughs</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Will you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached? Or are you looking for lasting love? Perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way? Every major storyline is accessible regardless of whether your approach to love is romantic or platonic. <br/><br/>Use an elaborate, dynamic story-crafting system to create love stories \u2013 and murder theories. Are the twists in the tale not to your taste? Then change the motive, the location, even the victim, and see how the stories adapt!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Your past will open different doors for you in London. What was your life on the Surface like? Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or dabble in the occult? <br/><br/>Your clothing will also make people think differently of you. Your outfits open new possibilities in conversation: be bolder, more commanding, more flirtatious. Ingratiate yourself with London's inhabitants by changing your style of dress \u2013 they won't be able to resist you in that hat!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You'll also work odd jobs and collect resources which will open new avenues in social situations. Your housemate Griz has found you work as census-taker for those curious new Masters. Fill your census-taker's notebook with intimate details about your fellow citizens and you'll find you can pursue deeper relationships with them, romantic or otherwise.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Archie</strong><br/><br/>For your housemate Archie, living in the Neath is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?<br/><br/><strong>The Tentacled Entrepreneur</strong><br/><br/>Appointed emissary to London by the Rubberies, he's establishing commercial interests and extending his tentacles in all sorts of directions.<br/><br/><strong>Ivy</strong><br/><br/>Not everyone enjoys the Neath. Bohemian seamstress Ivy sees its possibilities, and they give her life.<br/><br/><strong>David</strong><br/><br/>Destined to be Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim. When he returns from the dead, you can ask him all about it. He'd also like to tell you exactly what he thinks of his sister's new romantic entanglement.<br/><br/><strong>Rachel</strong><br/><br/>Rachel was halfway through her serialised novel when London fell and everything she was writing about was turned upside-down. Her publisher grows impatient. Fortunately (?) meeting Milton has rekindled her passion \u2013 for more than just writing.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Harjit</strong><br/><br/>When the Fall struck, Harjit stepped up to help anyone who needed it. Now he\u2019s settling into his role as a man in uniform, but the territory is unfamiliar \u2013 and, secretly, he has a missing person of his own to find.<br/><br/><strong>Griz</strong><br/><br/>For your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall of London has been a liberation \u2013 the chance to throw off her corsets, dump the dresses and be taken seriously in a position that would have been forbidden to her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.<br/><br/><strong>Milton</strong><br/><br/>Milton is the amber-eyed host of a literary parlour with a scalding handshake and a prior address in Hell. He\u2019s an excellent listener, but does he only want you for your soul?<br/><br/><strong>Horatia</strong><br/><br/>For a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. Since London fell, people need the security she offers more than ever. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.<br/><br/><strong>Mr Pages</strong><br/><br/>One of London's new, mysterious \u201cMasters\u201d, Mr Pages has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting London\u2019s first post-Fall census! But why are its questions so concerned with the love-lives of London\u2019s citizens? How do people declare their affection, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetically speaking?<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/>Explore this unique city in glorious, richly rendered 2D.
