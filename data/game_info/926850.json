It seems like only yesterday that your daring heroics left the Mad Leader in ruins, nipping his plans for world domination in the bud.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut intelligence reports indicate that the Mad Leader has risen from the smoldering ashes in which you left him. Once again, the world is in peril and only you \u2013 world-class sprinter, aerospace engineer, consultant to every free-world leader of the last two decades, and ace helicopter pilot \u2013 can stop the Mad Leader. Too bad; it looks like you\u2019ll have to postpone the christening of the USS McGibbits and that little soiree you had planned with Vanna this evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, you\u2019ll be busy flying your Gizmo DHX-1 Attack Chopper behind enemy lines in search of the Mad Leader\u2019s new headquarters. Once there, you\u2019ll begin an all-new series of ground missions to thwart the Mad Leader\u2019s revitalizing troops. But be careful!
