The combat allows each side (green vs. red) three turns to blow the smithereens out of the water using one of three possible projectiles.</p><p>As this is a prototype, that's the extent of the gameplay. There's no victory condition, no main menu, no <em>nothing</em>. Just straight-up tanks blowing the crap out of other tanks.</p><p>The game's controls:</p><ul>\n<li>Left-click and drag to pan the camera around.</li><li>Middle-mouse scroll to zoom in/out.</li><li>Ctrl+middle-mouse to rotate the camera.</li><li>Left-click a tank to select it (left-click anywhere else to deselect it).</li><li>Left-click a tank and drag to draw a line to a spot where you want to move the tank.</li><li>Left-click on an empty part of the screen and drag left/right to rotate the tank and up/down to adjust your trajectory.\r\n<ul>\n<li>Alternatively, you can use A/D/Left Arrow/Right Arrow to rotate the tank and W/S/Up Arrow/Down Arrow to adjust the trajectory.</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5f/d5f2dc5f4f4d01eb6944dc21c531e2ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Trent Polack"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
