But she discovers that the Halloween party she crashed is a costume party.. for monsters!? Should she run for her life, or find someone to enjoy the party with?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0This game is fairly short, with 7 different endings (some accessible in multiple ways), a small cast of characters, and simple art.\u00a0This game has no gore, but does have small amounts of blood in some of\u00a0the bad endings. It's intended for ages 16+, and has some very mild suggestive language. It's only available in English.</p>\n<p>I hope this game can help you get into the Halloween mood, and give you some amusement during this rough year!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:56:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ae/0ae1c52c313681123a6702b6e88e9398.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["marinya"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
