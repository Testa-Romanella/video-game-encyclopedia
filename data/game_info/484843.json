Hello, Qute<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>- Hi<br/><br/>- Since you're not a regular on Hollywood's red carpet and front page news, <br/>  I think we should do without flash and cut to the chase. What's your game about?<br/><br/><br/>- \"COCKHEAD\" is a story about one of us. A story that could have happened to anyone. <br/>  The story is that no one is born with balls of steel, but they can be gained by passing through numerous travails. <br/>  Game does not have any sexual or erotic implication. <br/>  Game have cartoon images of genitals, but they are used only as comic characters<br/>  In our game, we do not hint, say or show any sexual acts, penetrations or other things with an erotic component.<br/><br/>- It's intriguing, but as we said no more flash. <br/>  So, what awaits the player buying your game?<br/><br/>- Awaiting??! Yes, the player will be served with the richest hand-drawn art along with a classic platformer sauce, <br/>seasoned with gorgeous pieces in the Big Band style.<br/><br/>- Mmm, it makes my mouth water. Now let's sketch out what are the main features of your game?<br/><br/><br/><ul><li> 1. Fully hand-drawn artwork<br/></li><li>  2. Classic platformer in non-standard setting<br/></li><li>  3. Jazz Big Band style accompaniment<br/></li><li>  4. A new version of the story everybody knows</li></ul><br/>- Thank you so much for that. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words on your own behalf?<br/><br/>- Surely. Anyone who doesn't like or just doesn't care about this story, please avoid buying or playing it. <br/>All others are welcome, add the game to your wishlist and keep up with the latest news.
