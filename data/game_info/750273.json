It's a simple 3D pong/arkanoid style game. I made only one level but could add some others in the future I also\u00a0had some difficulties with some bugs, then I didn't have much time to continue working on it and had to stop. So the final result is very simple. I made it using Godot 3.2. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T11:42:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df2c1998c86c2b9d62819b7b4802855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FGR Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
