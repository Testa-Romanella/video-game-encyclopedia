However, your hands are slippery and unable to grasp the toys easily, slipping them from your hand. How will you overcome this situation, especially during your shift?<br/><br/>The control is only left mouse button and mouse cursor.</p><p>Leave your highscore down the comments and see who is better at packaging toys with slippery hands. Good luck!<br/></p><p>Note: if you see toys just appeared into the sides of the walls, it's a prevention from the toys clipping out of the game. This is my first time using RigidBody2D and here I'm experimenting to apply them in this scenario.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T06:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b1/2b169117bb125537b7c4d1e78d38c180.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TheGamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
