Have fun and good luck running away from that thing!</p>\n<p>This is only the 1st\u00a0prototype of the game. As of right now,\u00a0there is no proper UI or sound effects, they will be added soon (this winter maybe). I also intend to make several balance changes to the obstacles and enemies since they all still feel a bit off.</p>\n<p>Also sometimes your bullets won't register upon hitting an enemy, that is because\u00a0unity has a crappy collision system and so far it seems like\u00a0there's no workaround for it. I might as well\u00a0just\u00a0switch to Godot in the next update, LOL</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T17:01:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c0d/c0d8c64bcefe506861fc610088dde431.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tzsptd"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
