It is a final project for Week 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Differences from Michigan\u00a0State University tutorial version:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Added 4 unique </strong><strong>enemies with new behaviors:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1. Stationary Turret Spread\u00a0: Rotates back and forth, constantly shooting projectiles\u00a0</p>\n<p>2. Stationary Seeker Turret : The gun of this turret tracks player's position until a certain angle</p>\n<p>3. Mothership : Destructible ship spawner - spawns smaller variants of chasers</p>\n<p>3.1 Heavy Mothership types :\u00a0Destructible ship spawners - that spawn regular chasers and seekers</p>\n<p>4. Heavy Seeker Shooter : A\u00a0chaser with two projectile spawners instead of guns</p>\n<p><strong>Added 3 reskinned enemies with similar behaviors:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Seeker :\u00a0Alternative, faster version of chaser</p>\n<p>2. Mothership Seeker :\u00a0smaller version of chaser spawned by Motherships</p>\n<p>3. Seeker Shooter : Alternative, faster version of chasing straight shooter.</p>\n<p><strong>Added 7 unique\u00a0enemy skins with animations:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>My </em><em>sprites </em><em>consist of Photoshopped elements of enemy sprites in the original version rearranged in new ways.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Seeker, Mothership Seeker, Seeker Shooter, Heavy Seeker Shooter,\u00a0Stationary Turret Spread, Stationary\u00a0Seeker Turret,\u00a0Mothership</p>\n<p><strong>Added 3 powerups with their own skins:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Health Pickup\u00a0: Boosts Current health by +1 up until the limit of 10.</p>\n<p>2. Damage Boost : Increases damage of player projectiles by 1, increases their size by small amount.\u00a0<em>Code-wise -\u00a0</em><em>causes player to refer to a different prefab of projectiles.</em></p>\n<p>3. Shooting Speed Boost : Increases player's shooting speed by 0.01 (<em>reduces the shooting speed value from 1 up until the limit of 0.01</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>Added a finish line for clearing the level:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><em>This is a collider that tracks whether the player has crossed it, returns a boolean value and tells GameManager to clear the level</em></p>\n<p><strong>Added a lives counter:</strong></p>\n<p>Added a lives counter attached to the GameUI in separate code from UI Manager.</p>\n<p>1.\u00a0The counter turns red at 1 life<br/></p>\n<p>2. The counter turns green at 10 lives (maximum).</p>\n<p><strong>Added a bunch of code:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Created code adjustable in Unity\u00a0for Stationary\u00a0Seeker Turrets</p>\n<p>2. Created code adjustable in Unity\u00a0for\u00a0Stationary Turret Spread</p>\n<p><em>Unfortunately, due to the mix-up in positive/negative values of rotation - I managed to make it work only when these turrets face downwards.</em><br/></p>\n<p>3. Created booster collision detection scripts and added separate behavior for each booster as described above.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Created three separate levels different from the tutorial version:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. Level 1 - You can only shoot and look upwards. Camera adjusted to look slightly higher. Movement free. Linear level. Progression\u00a0level is the smoothest.</p>\n<p>2. Level 2 - You can look and shoot in all directions. Camera centered. Movement free. Level has a few nooks and crannies with boosts and enemies.</p>\n<p>3. Level 3 - version of Level 1 with ridiculous enemy numbers, but more power for player from the very start.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Created by PostleService\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-13T04:04:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07d/07d63b44ee23c8499f7f42d17a1a2d61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["PostleService"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
