Press P when your screen starts to glitch out because of Foxy. For Bonnie, when you hear him coming from a door go to the opposite door. Bonnie likes to deceive you by making you think he is coming from the left door but he is actually coming from the right or he is coming from the right door but he is actually coming from the left. Shadow Freddy only comes after 2 AM, when he comes you will hear a ticking sound. when you hear the 30th tick press 7, if you press 7 before the 30th tick you will be jump-scared. You have 2 seconds after the 29th tick to press 7. Each hour lasts for 89 seconds. The continue button now works and you can press the green flag after beating the game to enter night 2, night 2 is not finished yet and will be fully finished in 3.0, this game is in its alpha stages and might always have bugs in it for the rest of its alpha and beta stages. Try not to hold A or D while pressing space as this can cause a glitch, press or hold B to fix this glitch [This glitch cannot or might never be fixed].</p>\n<p>_______________</p>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<p>________________</p>\n<p>I made this by myself, anybody claiming to have made this game is lying.
