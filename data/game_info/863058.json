She promised she'd help you, however she can be a bit... unpredictable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every ten seconds, you'll be presented with three cards, and you get to pick one, which will help you defeat the hordes of angels and their masters. The more powerful ones are rarer, but who knows, a pinch of luck might send one your way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Did I mention the hordes of angels trying to destroy you? Yes? Well they will also get reinforcements every ten seconds, as the doors to your current room open.</p>\n<p>Beating an archangel will also get you on Miss Fate's good side, increasing your odds to get better cards. That also tends to put you on God's bad side though, so more angels will spawn, and they'll be stronger too. Nothing you can't handle though, right?</p>\n<p>________________________________________________</p>\n<p>Controls :\u00a0</p>\n<p>- WASD or \u21e6 \u21e9 \u21e7 \u21e8 for movements</p>\n<p>- Shoot and select cards with left mouse click</p>\n<p>________________________________________________</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:34:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae8/ae8ce5065dde4099f8b6faa3f31124e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sozey"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
