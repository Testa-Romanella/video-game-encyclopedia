It is my (first?) entry to the 12th edition (2023) of the BASIC 10 Liner Contest, PUR-80 category. The game has been entirely coded in BASIC language and the program is 10 lines long. Since the ZX81 BASIC allows only one statement per line, the program consists of only 10 statements.</p>\n<p>You love playing squash, but let's face it, you're not so good at it (I'm just kidding, I'm sure you're a great player; I just needed something for the game introduction). But don't worry, with the right training you'll become an ace! So... let's start!</p>\n<p>Move your racket by tapping O (left) or P (right). Every time you hit the ball, it will bounce with a random direction (I told you you are not so good at Squash!) and you will score one point. If you score 99 points, your training is over. If the ball falls beyond your racket, the game is over and you can start again by pressing R (RUN) and then Enter. Your current score is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T13:23:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/047/047fb79adf36e653b4e2b1e0be18f7fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["marco's retrobits"], "genres": ["Action", "Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
