You treat her as if she was your daughter. In this visual novel you get taken through a few small moments through out the time of her getting well and, you guys becoming a family. There is only one ending, so you don't have to take the choices into serious thought. </p>\n<p>My main goal for this visual novel is really just to make some nice wholesome content. I hope I did well. This novel is really more of a concept game then a fully fleshed out piece, and I hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-31T04:40:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/314/3146da3b11b15a5ad1cfd8a486488496.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RodFireProductions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
