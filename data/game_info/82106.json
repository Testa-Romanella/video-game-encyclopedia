You have to build up each one in suit from Ace to King (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K).<br/><br/>Play: As the game begins, FreeCell Solitaire deals all 52 cards into the tableau. You have to move all the cards from the stock to the 4 suit foundations. Each one foundation should be built upward, in sequence from Ace to King. You are allowed to put to an empty foundation only Aces. Then you should add there only the following higher card, and only of the same suit.<br/><br/>Cards within the tableau should be build in descending sequence of alternating colors. For instance, if there is 6 of red suit, you can put on it only 5 of black suit. You can put to foundation the lowest card of a sequence, as well as put a sequence of cards as a unit from one pile to another.<br/><br/>Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.<br/><br/>The game will end in two cases: a) no more moves left - so you've lost; b) all foundations are filled - and you've won!<br/><br/>Just find a minute to forget your day-to-day worries and play!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:22:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/116/1166efa4088333bc4e395203cfe4cf1f.jpg", "website": "http://www.softick.com/iphone/free-cell-solitaire/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Softick"], "genres": ["Card"], "publishers": ["Softick"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
