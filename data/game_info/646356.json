The more you play the quicker you are going to be able to figure what you will need to do in a real Truck. I have nearly two decades of driving a truck and have backed up over 60K times and have thought over 150 students as a company trainer. I know what struggles new drivers go through having to learn how to back up with a real truck and trailer and how scary it is. This truck driving simulator takes the guesswork out and gives you the confidence to back up into any dock.<br/><br/>\u25ba CDL Training<br/>I have set up CDL training levels for lots of different size trailers and all the scenarios that you will be tested on. The trailer sizes are 28, 35, 48, and 53 feet long and each level is custom-built for the trailer size.<br/><br/>\u25ba Hard Campaign Level<br/>When you start to get more comfortable with the normal campaign you can try your skills on the same levels but with Blind Spots turned on. When you are driving on these levels you are only going to be able to see what you would if you are sitting in the cab. But there is a \"Get Out And Look\" button that you can use that will turn off the Blind Spots so when you are unsure if you are going to hit something.<br/><br/>\u25ba Steering Wheel Turning<br/>You guys requested it so we now to a steering wheel feature for you to be able to turn the truck. I hope you like it!!<br/>\u25ba Slider Turning<br/>To turn left or right in this man truck game all you have to do is slide your finger to the left or the right on the bottom 25% of the screen. You don't even have to start from the center, just slide your finger in the direction you want it to turn. Sliding your finger from one side of the screen to the other will let you turn your steers from one side to the other, but be careful if you have the steers pointing all the way to the right and you want to have them all the way to the left, sliding from the center of the screen will only point the steers straight so you will have to slide your finger more. The slider is just an indicator if you want to see where your steering is. A lot of the time I will look at the steering slider to see that I am pointing my steer perfectly straight before I start to back up and then just pay attention to my trailer and the green lines.<br/><br/>\u25ba Speed<br/>The rest of the screen in my truck practice simulator is for controlling the speed. Anywhere on the top 75% of the screen can you slide your finger up or down to move forward or reverse. If you want to stop all you have to do I double-tap anywhere on the screen and you will screech to a stop.<br/><br/>You can zoom in and out by using two fingers and pinching, and you can pan around the map too by moving your two fingers around the screen.<br/><br/>You will find that there are RED, Green, and blue lines that are on the truck and trailer. There is a REALLY big reason for this. Without these lines, I think that the trucking game would be unnecessary hard. The red line shows you the direction that the back of the trailer is pointing towards. And if you have ever seen my videos before I started using this heavy truck simulator game to demonstrate backing, I always had RED lines showing where the trailer was pointing. I have found that it is very hard to see that without the red line in a game that is a top-down view (aerial view). The green lines are to show you how straight your truck and trailer are. Just like in the real world all you have to do is look in your mirrors to see if you are straight. The blue line not as important but I added them anyway because a top-down view does not always give you a good indication of where you are driving towards when your steers are pointing straight. I do love my lines.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-09T02:56:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb51e18161f702e5acf8af36dc07457_SwKSmzX.jpg", "website": "https://mytruckingskills.com/the-game/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David Crowley"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Educational"], "publishers": ["David Crowley"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
