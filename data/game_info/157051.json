Help him eat the carrots, avoiding the spikes. Thanks to video game logic, he can jump in the air indefinitely. Sounds easy right? He especially likes the big carrots and gives you 10 points for each one. But watch out for the rotating spikes that hurt our rabbit.\r\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p><em>If you're interested in seeing how to develop such a small game ... I plan to upload all code and assets to GITHUB. As soon as I did that, I will publish the link to the project here.</em></p>\n<p><em>!! Attention: So far, only the macOS and web version has been sufficiently tested. If bugs occur when running on Linux or Windows, please report them. Many thanks for the support.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/348/3484d99526a016874419e09dbf7bb3d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["dev.mars"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
