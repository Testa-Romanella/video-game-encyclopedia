Scientists have created a new species, starting with its first named Experiment X. Kept in a cryosleep, X has been suffering years of tests done, drugs injected into its body, and overall awful living conditions. One day, something went wrong and the chamber that was supposed to keep X asleep and immobile was no longer functioning properly, and he woke up.
