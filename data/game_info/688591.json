Use the last big tree left! Revive! Purify water on the barren land! \"Revive\" is a PC based strategy game. In this game, players need to plant plants to continuously purify the surrounding land and finally purify the whole land. Rivers crisscross and mountains crisscross. You need to unlock different plants to deal with different terrain. Of course, the purification process is not as smooth as ever. With the passage of time, some secondary disasters may occur. Fire will suddenly come and burn your plants; A sandstorm will stop you from moving on. In any case, find your own solutions and strategies.</p>\n<p>Cause the authors are all sophomores and are poor at English, therefore there must be some bugs. Any suggestions are welcomed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:59:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71f/71f578b3f7a78973ed54a3a2d3e7e07f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["CareEJoken"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
