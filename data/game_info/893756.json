The world mirrors our own, but is it a mirror or an aspect of ourselves we've long since forgotten? Those answers lie hidden in the moonlight.</p>\n<p>Get to know a few of the characters who'll become a staple within the concept, and experience\u00a05 main paths with a total of\u00a015 endings. If you're picky about those endings being different, there's still at least ten.</p>\n<p>The base concept for the Eighth Night was also co-made with a friend who wishes to go unnamed, and uncredited aside from this sentence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T09:30:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e4/3e4df22dfb9e51d7e9ba3697083071bb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Z.D.Prince"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
