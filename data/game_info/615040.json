What does canola need to thrive optimally? Learn about the processes in plant cells, playfully help it grow, and become an excellent plant scientist.</h3><br/><br/><strong>LEARNING CAN TAKE PLACE ANYWHERE AND AT ANY TIME</strong><br/>Together with plant researchers:inside the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Breakpoint One and Simmation have created a high-quality educational experience. VR Plant Journey \"Die Reise in die Pflanze\" teaches children biological knowledge in a playful way. Thanks to fully immersive virtual reality (VR), players:inside are completely immersed in the inner workings of a canola plant, experience the events up close and can even control them.<br/><br/><strong>EDUTAINMENT MEANS ENTERTAINING LEARNING</strong><br/>In three chapters - root, leaf and seed - you test out how an optimum of nutrients must be regulated for the development of plant organs. <br/>The unusual learning unit is lightened up by playful elements. <br/>In the leaf, for example, chloroplasts are thrown with the basic substances of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water; in the root, ammonium and nitrate, important plant nutrients, have to be assembled; and in the seed, oil bodies have to be hit with a bow and arrow so that they grow. <br/><br/><strong>The high-quality implementation of the concept is reflected in several internationally renowned award nominations: 2019 for the VRnow Award \"Best Learning Solution\", 2020 for the Auggie Award \"Biggest Societal Impact\" and 2020 for the Laval Virtual Award in the category: \"VR/AR for Learning and Training\".</strong><br/><br/>Follow us on Facebook and never miss news, discounts and promotions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T03:23:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f4/9f49379be43d160f540aec8455d41165.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 366, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Simmation", "Breakpoint One"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Breakpoint One", "Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung"], "esrb_rating": null}
