Two connecting islands can either have one or two bridges. <br/><br/>You win Hashi, when every island is connected either directly or indirectly with every other island. That means that they must build a closed network. But be aware, that bridges must not be crossing each other.<br/><br/>Enjoy it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T09:44:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f0a4cee1c3520468a687a7952bc6b56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Qingqing Wang"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Qingqing Wang"], "esrb_rating": null}
