But basically you can use:\u00a0arrow keys/\"wasd\" for movement, \"q\" and \"e\" for camera movement, \"i\" for attacks and \"z\" for actions/skip dialogues/get out of buildings.</p>\n<p>This is just a very early prototype, the idea for the game is that every time you start a new game you generate an entire planet-worth of upperworld, it's population and you have a different starting story every time, then you are free to explore the world, interact, do quests,.. for now it's always an island-sized world, with a town and a mine-dungeon, characters colors are randomized, buildings compositions are randomized but that's it. Oh the gameplay it's in a very early stage too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T12:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a71/a7182d3061db338864b0f69733bb3ad5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolTsuki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
