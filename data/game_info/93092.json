Stuck, your only option is to grab a compass and look for help. You explore the Red Forest and encounter doors standing alone, haunting scenery, and strange chambers.</p><p>Turn on \"Walk Sim\" mode where anything threatening is removed and you can just enjoy the creepy atmosphere of the Red Forest. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e97/e977da172f169558e59726edea670f4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Haunted Window"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
