Outside of the dojos Maples will spawn and try to steal your melons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Try to defend your melons for 5 rounds and you will get them as reward\u00a0(Melon Currency). Killing Maples will also grant you reward (Maple Currency).\u00a0</p>\n<p>For those currencies you're able to unlock new stuff or buy things in the shop.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>No Real Money!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I think many of you will think of real money when you read about upgrades and shop. But no. The game doesn't use any payments services so you can't and will never be able to buy things with real money. If you want them - you have to play the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Intro</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The game has an intro which will explain everything to you. You have to watch it once. From the on the intro will be skipable (via escape-key or enter-button).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:43:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63a/63a2763c6d04539547e931bfef49b984.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tomate Salat"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
