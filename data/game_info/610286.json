{"id": 610286, "slug": "kells", "name": "Kells", "name_original": "Kells", "description": "Kells is a retro puzzle similar to the original Lemmings except instead of issuing specific commands to your Kells, you manipulate their movement using special Gravity Tiles instead. These tiles change the direction of gravity as Kells walk or fall over them, allowing you to manipulate your Kells in crazy ways like making them \u201cfall upwards\u201d to clear obstacles, \u201cfall forward\u201d to avoid dangerous spike pits, and even walk up or down walls!<br/><br/><br/><br/>You begin your journey on Kell Island with a single Kell called Harold. Harold is part of a group of 50 Kells known as The Kellective, but they have all been separated. Your goal is to reunite Harold with the other members of The Kellective as you embark on a journey of discovery through the varied islands on the World Map, searching for The Last Level.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Can you find The Last Level?<h3>Permadeath</h3><br/>When a Kell dies in this game, it's gone for good. Even if you restart the level or rage quit in an attempt to reverse time, it makes no difference. Death is permanent in Kells*. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the beginning it's just you and Harold so you'll need to be extra careful and you'll probably be seeing the \"GAME OVER\" screen a lot in the beginning. But as you progress through the game and recruit members to The Kellective, each Kell acts as an extra life in a way, and you can continue on your journey, accepting the many deaths that will be all your fault as you go and as long as you cling on to at least one Kell, you'll be safe in the knowledge that the The Last Level will be within your reach! The question is - how many Kells are you willing to perish to get there?<h3>Other Highlights</h3><ul><li> There are various different paths to the Last Level - will you take is easy and follow the easier but longer route or dare you risk more difficult route to reach The Last Level quicker?<br/></li><li> 100 Levels in total. Can you complete them all? Better still, can you perfect them all?<br/></li><li> This game is full of secrets to discover. Rumour has it, there is even an entire Secret Island to unlock as well! <br/></li><li> Can you track down all the missing Kells and fully restore the Kellective?<br/></li><li> For completionists, there are 10 Purple Kellectibles scattered around the levels in difficult-to-access locations. Can you kellect them all?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T03:10:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/741/741ce439e7520ae4be5857158bc44590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Paul Drummond"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Paul Drummond"], "esrb_rating": null}
