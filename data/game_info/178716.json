Use the slider to determine the radius of just how far out from where you click the colours appear. It lags a bit at higher values. This is because I don't actually know what I am doing in Unity or C# lol. But I think I have some ideas on how to fix this. </p><p>Anyway you can play with it if you want. Later on I might fix it up to be less laggy and not to say 'Pong Tutorial' when you load it up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b2911f262326c527dcbd608bf814d221.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
