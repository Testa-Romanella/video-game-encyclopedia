If you run out of patience and absolutely don't know what to do, here's a guide <em>(don't read if you don't need it)</em>:</p>\n<ul><li>It's usually best to do the same attack as the foe did. <em>(If the foe did a stroke from the front, you should also do a stroke from the front.)<br/></em></li><li>Never prepare for the next attack two times in a row if the foe didn't attack you right after the first preparation. <em>(The preparation lasts until the foe attacks you so don't waste time by a second preparation. Better do an attack.)<br/></em></li><li>If the foe prepares for the next attack, you also should. Unless he does it two times in a row (see the previous piece of advice). Do a stroke from the side, then. It's the most successful kind of attack. <em>(If you do any other kind of attack, you have extremely small chance to succeed.)</em></li><li>If the foe is almost out of health, do a stroke from the side. <em>(It's unnecessary to do an attack with a big damage, if even the weakest kind of attack - the stroke from the side - can kill him.)<br/></em></li><li>Use your brain and be patient.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to help<br/></strong></p>\n<p>I'm asking you for some little help. Please, inform me about bugs or translation errors you detect. Of course, I'll also be glad if you write me some suggestions to improve the game or ideas for other games.
