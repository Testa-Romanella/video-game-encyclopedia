Ninety three subjects were chosen based on their family history and ethnic origins. They were subjected to vigorous physical testing to insure they were of perfect health. Then, as soon as night fell, the real research began. Each subject was hooked up to a host of monitoring equipment and given a mild sedative. Soon they had all drifted off to sleep, and the researchers retired to their beds for the night.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>But when the alarm clock rang out in the early morning light, the researchers were bewildered to find patient after patient dead in their beds. No wounds. No explanation\u2026 All but one. A single terrified subject survived.
