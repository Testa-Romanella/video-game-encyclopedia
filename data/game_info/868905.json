{"id": 868905, "slug": "balzamirs-cursed-dungeon", "name": "Balzamir's Cursed Dungeon", "name_original": "Balzamir's Cursed Dungeon", "description": "Kidnapped! The reclusive wizard known as Balzamir has captured 4 adventurers from across the world and trapped them in his bizarre dungeon. The only way out is a trapdoor that requires 3 keys to unlock, but Balzamir will only allow 2 of the adventurers to leave, cursing the others to join his undead army.\r\n<p>Players take turns navigating through the dungeon, collecting keys to open the trapdoor. These keys are protected by magical seals, and the only way to break them is to perform strange tasks to entertain the twisted Balzamir. Players will race against each other to collect 3 keys and unlock the trapdoor to escape.\r\n</p>\n\r\n\u2013\u00a0OBJECTIVE\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\r\n<p>The objective of Balzamir\u2019s Cursed Dungeon is to collect 3 keys and return to the trapdoor at the center of the dungeon before the opposing team.</p>\r\n\u2013\u00a0PLAYERS \u2013\u00a0\r\n<p>This game is to be played by 4 players working in teams of 2. These teams are represented by the colors of the character models in game (red and orange vs. green and blue).\u00a0The turn order is as follows: red, green, orange, blue.\u00a0 The end of the blue player\u2019s turn marks the end of a round.<br/></p>\r\n\u2013\u00a0MOVING \u2013\u00a0\r\n<p>On a player\u2019s turn they can move up to 2 tiles from their current location. Move by clicking on tiles adjacent to the player\u2019s current location. Choose to not move by clicking on the tile they are currently on.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\n\u2013\u00a0TASKS \u2013\u00a0\r\n<p>Task tiles are the chests on certain tiles of the dungeon. If a player ends their turn on one of these tiles, they will be given a task to complete once the round has ended (after the blue player has finished moving).\u00a0A team may have up to 3 tasks active at a time. Either player on the team can collect tasks, and the tasks may be completed by either player on the team.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Different tasks will have different time limits, shown on the top of the card. Failing to complete the task within the time limit will result in the task being failed, and the team receives no reward. Successfully completing a task within the time limit awards the team with a key.\u00a0</p>\r\n\u2013\u00a0WINNING \u2013\u00a0\r\n<p>In order to end the game, a team must collect 3 keys, then return to the trapdoor at the center of the board. The first team to collect 3 keys and have both players return to the trapdoor is the winner.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T11:34:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c640a7936daada3777b79eccf8030331.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GreatBrick", "Josiahhammer"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
