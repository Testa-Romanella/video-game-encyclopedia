This is my 2D Platformer Project <em>Way Back to Earth.</em></p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<p>1. Added new types of Enemies such as Static Enemies and Waypoint Enemies</p>\n<p>2. Made the game more complicated and difficult so that the players would need to plan their routines.</p>\n<p>3. Added a function that allow the player to shoot the enemies with his new Alien Weapon! (this function includes new scripts on both the player and the enemies)</p>\n<p>4. Made an entirely different 2nd Level which is even more challenging and requires the player to use the shooting weapon.</p><p>Tips for beating the game:</p><p>1st Level: You need to find the grey key on the very right to unlock the door to the goal.</p><p>2nd Level: You need to use your shooting weapon to kill to static enemies in order to reach the grey key and continue.</p>\n<p>Created by Joseph Su</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T09:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/152/152d66ceb4c60df9f44c91b4bc8ae20f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Yuki-Katana"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
