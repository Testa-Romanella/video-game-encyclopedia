After some time or if four minis make it back home the ghosts will respawn. You can eat the mini ghosts even if you're not powered up.</p>Although it doesn't showcase the best of the games it incorporates it was a great learning experience for simple AI, A*(A Star) pathing systems, and just general Unity2D coding practice.<p>Controls:</p><p>WASD or Arrow keys to move.</p><p>Space to start game</p><p>X to reset scores. (Deletes local score)</p><p>Note: I'm still getting used to exporting as WebGL. If it's too big for your screen or doesn't fit the browser please download the standalone which works MUCH better.</p><p>Credits: This is all done by me, but does use the wonderful A* Pathfinding project (free version) by Aron Granberg:</p><p>http://arongranberg.com/astar/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f1/5f1ac2a6501b32ba55a5213d4bde5c91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["4KbShort"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
