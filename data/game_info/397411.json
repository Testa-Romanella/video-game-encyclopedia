Begin a new chapter for your Sim when they enroll in the historical University of Britechester or modern Foxbury Institute. Live in a dorm room or off-campus, explore Britechester on a bicycle, spend time in the student commons, and have a study session at the library. Cheer on the student body at a school spirit event and wear school colors to show your Sim\u2019s pride.</p>\n<p>STAY CLASSY<br />\nSims enroll in the University that piques their interest, finding classes in biology, computer science, art history, and even villainy. Attend a lecture or work on term papers and presentations \u2013 the more your Sim learns, the better they will be in careers like teaching, law, and engineering. Going to classes or blowing them off will affect your Sim\u2019s grades, so time management is a must.</p>\n<p>MEET, MINGLE, AND EXPLORE<br />\nHow your Sim embraces college life is up to them. They can study all night to complete homework or chill out and sleep in. And, with activities like juice pong, juggling a soccer ball, and hanging out with roommates, taking a break has never been so fun! Plus, your Sim can join school organizations like robotics, debate, art, or even a mysterious secret society. As the school year progresses, Sims become their best selves and discover who they are meant to be.</p>\n<p>EXPRESS YOUR CAMPUS STYLE<br />\nMake your Sim\u2019s space cozy with dorm room d\u00e9cor that reflects their personality with objects like posters and a mini-fridge. Then, develop their personal style in any way you choose \u2013 whether wearing late-for-class sweatpants or their best-self slacks, there\u2019s always a way to show school spirit or impress a classmate.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T20:22:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b38/b383f3eecb35573371c2fb129bb816ec.jpg", "website": "https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/packs/expansion-packs/the-sims-4-discover-university", "rating": 4.0, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 4, "beaten": 8, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Maxis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
