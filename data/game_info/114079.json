{"id": 114079, "slug": "no-solid-ground", "name": "No Solid Ground", "name_original": "No Solid Ground", "description": "<p>A web version is also available.</p><p>\n<em>No Solid Ground</em> is a 3D competitive multiplayer game with simple mechanics that harken back to the early days of gaming. Players try to avoid falling from the quickly collapsing structure into the lava below. Up to four players compete to see who can stay alive the longest. Don't stand still for too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>No Solid Ground</em> was heavily inspired by top down snake games such as <em>Tron Light Cycles</em> and the 2D platformer trope where an unstable bridge collapses just as your character crosses it specifically dungeons in <em>Zelda II</em>. This was my first foray into making a game from scratch in Unity 3D. My main focus here was getting right the basics of play and fun.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe background music is Mess by Anamanaguchi and is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives(aka Music Sharing) 3.0 International License.<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tNo Solid Ground can be played using for gamepad controllers or the keyboard.<br/>\r\n\tStart: Space, Enter or a gamepad button.<br/>\r\n\tGreen: Arrow Keys<br/>\r\n\tRed: WASD<br/>\r\n\tYellow: TFGH<br/>\r\n\tBlue: IJKL<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tHint: With enough speed a player can jump a pit if it is narrow enough.<br/>\r\n\tHint: A single player game isn't very fun.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b85/b8501c36d8935e841b5899eb47fb581f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Artfail"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
