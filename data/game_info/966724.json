We hope you enjoy our final results!<br/><br/>It's the year 2114. Humanity is on the brink of extinction. An unknown organism spreads across the earth and annihilates the whole ecosystem. The cause of this catastrophe lies deep in the Abyss, an old city built on the perimeter of a deep and massive crater.<br/>As an Abyss-Diver, your mission is to discover the city and search for a way to prevent humanity's extinction.<br/>Explore the city, collect items, and fight against enemies and bosses.<br/><br/><strong>Race against time</strong><br/>You're not welcome in the Abyss. The unknown organism will do everything to protect itself. The longer you stay, more enemies will appear and they're stronger than before. So watch out for the timer, which indicates the next incoming difficulty level. Good luck!<br/><br/><strong>Level up</strong><br/>Distributed throughout the whole level and by defeating enemies, you can collect various trigger and effect items, which can be combined into a powerful upgrade for your character. There are nearly limitless combinations, so every run is a unique experience. Also, with every level up, you can upgrade fixed stats of your character.<br/><br/><strong>Enemies</strong><br/>Face different types of enemies, each with an unique set of movement and attacks. Equipped with cutting-edge technology, these enemies are trained to eliminate you as quickly as possible. So watch out for swarms of drones or the deadly sound of the big laser.<br/><br/><strong>Boss fight</strong><br/>To progress further in the Abyss, you have to face the Stormcaller. This boss it not made out of sugar. With heavy and smaller sneaky attacks, the Stormcaller tries everything to prevent you from reaching the end of the Abyss. With his little helpers, this boss should not be underestimated. Will you defeat the Stormcaller or are you set back to beginning? What are you waiting for?! Jump right into the action and show the Abyss who the boss is.<br/><br/><strong>Sponsoring</strong><br/>Special thanks to Randstad Digital Germany AG for sponsoring the game and made it possible to have merch and nice teamevents for our team.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-22T05:21:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bf/0bfa1b85b6bbba500ee3645720c10834.jpg", "website": "https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/ifg/games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 300, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LabOne48"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["LabOne48"], "esrb_rating": null}
