What shall he do when he needs to cook a meal and move to the next room? He'll sneak around the guards, get his ingredients, cook, and finish in time to save the day!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This is my first completed jam submission, and it has issues! I wasn't able to get any sound in, the tutorial is a single screen that can be accessed in game or at the main menu (if you're not sure what to do check it out by using ESC or P). So much art wasn't finalized, and a fully missing UI. Only one level in the game, the main character doesn't rotate, and very little testing as I drove this project like I stole it!</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to send a special thanks to:<br/>- GamesPlusJames, http://gamesplusjames.com/, for all his great tutorials AND the easy to use Unity menu plugin.<br/>- Kenny, https://kenney.nl/assets, for making so many awesome assets and allowing people to use them (I made the ingredients and pot sprites, that's why their quality is so low).<br/>- Aron Granberg, https://arongranberg.com/astar/front, thank you for the A* plug in and tutorials.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/064/064a0a0b72718330d68da1564550dcc9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ObusWolf"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
