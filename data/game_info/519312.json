It was made in two months, so please keep that in mind. There are no (or very little) custom assets as the challenge was to tell a story with pre-made assets. None of us are native speakers and we apologize for any mistake. Please feel free to contact us if you would like to proofread the game officially.<br/>TW : the game is quite dark and heavy and was made with an adult audience in mind, so please be careful.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/861/8619f00760239e8e86e71f95f1fb83cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spongey Kitty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
