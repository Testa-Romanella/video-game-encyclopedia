Elden Ring GB</strong> is a demake of <strong>Elden Ring</strong> that runs on real retro hardware including <strong>all Game Boy consoles</strong>, as well as in <strong>emulators\u00a0</strong>and on\u00a0<strong>Analogue Pocket</strong>. You can also play it right here in your <strong>browser</strong>, though the other methods are recommended to allow for saving,\u00a0better colours and higher accuracy. Explore all of the <strong>Precipice of Anticipation,</strong><strong> Northern Limgrave </strong>and<strong> Stormveil Castle</strong> in this bite-sized demake experience made in <strong>GB Studio.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>A in top down sections-</strong> roll</li><li><strong>A in side on sections-</strong> jump</li><li><strong>A in front of person or object-</strong> interact</li><li><strong>B- </strong>attack</li><li><strong>A\u00a0+ B + Select + Start-</strong> return to title screen</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Browser controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Z in top down sections-</strong> roll\r\n</li><li><strong>Z in side on sections-</strong> jump\r\n</li><li><strong>Z in front of person or\u00a0object- </strong>interact\r\n</li><li><strong>X- </strong>attack\r\n</li><li><strong>Z\u00a0+ X + Shift + Enter-</strong> return to title screen\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>How do I play the game on hardware?-</strong> Download the .gb file and write it to\u00a0a flashcart.\u00a0It is a standard Game Boy ROM under 2MB using MBC5. You can also use it with emulators like BGB. If you have an Analogue Pocket, download the .pocket file instead.</li><li><strong>Why isn't there any music?</strong>- There is only music on the title screen. If playing in browser, make sure you click on the game to start the music.\u00a0It's\u00a0difficult to implement sound\u00a0in GB Studio 3.0, but\u00a0I would like to add more in the future.<br/>\n</li><li><strong>Why did you only make Limgrave?- </strong>Because\u00a0I need to find an actual job instead of working on this game. I would like to expand the game in the future, but no promises.</li><li><strong>I found a bug! What should I do?-</strong>\u00a0If you find a bug that you think is an obvious oversight, let me know on Twitter @shintendoYT. I am aware of the v1.0 0HP bug, and will fix it soon.\u00a0Collision bugs and crashes are most likely due to GB Studio stability, and will hopefully be improved in the future.</li><li><strong>I am crazy, how can I give you money?-</strong> The game is free.\u00a0Wait until my next original project and buy that. If you really like you can support my Twitch channel shintendoTV. And if you're feeling really crazy, I would like to give away some physical cartridges for free, but they cost money. Let me know if you want to help with that.</li><li><strong>When is this game getting updated, and what is your next project?</strong> Follow my Twitch, Twitter and YouTube for more info coming soon...</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T17:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/351/35179446da8d3c9ed8a36c03196e62a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shin"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
