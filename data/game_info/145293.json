I'm uploading this because I hope to get some good feedback and maybe some tips to make the game better.  I'm not sure if I will implement the feedback in this game or make a new game completely since I haven't really worked on this in a while.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAnyway I hope you enjoy the game for what it is!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d9/0d984f3a0d87744556d05ef02f48cc6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dansity"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
