For your XP and levels also double as your health! If you foolishly let any enemy get close enough to attack you, it will begin to drain your XP and levels! Once you reach level 0, you will fall to darkness...</p>\n<p>Every minute that passes, your adversaries will grow in power. If you are brave enough and make it to the 10th minute, you win!</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>LMB - Cast Fireball\u00ae</p>\n<p>Space - Open Shop</p>\n<p>WASD - Move</p>\n\n<p>This was created for the first SEANJAMIN Game Jam competition between Sean and myself. The constraints were that we could only use the Micro Roughlike Asset Pack by Kenney, and had the randomly chosen theme of \"Growth\". Also I am aware that \"Kenny\" in the title is spelt differently to the name of the asset pack creator. They are <em>completely </em>unrelated. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T08:18:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/09f/09ff3edd67d8bcf436b59f4541dd2164.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benjamin Pilbrow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
