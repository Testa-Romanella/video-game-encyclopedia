Due to your ability to critique and assess foods to a very professional standard, people assumed that you're also a great chef, not knowing of your flaw. Even worse, you've been hired as the personal chef for the president's child (Glutton) for a week!</p>\n<p>Luckily, you have a plan. You gather chefs from your backdoor, framed as an event to \"see who's worthy of cooking for the \u00a0Glutton\", while you serve their food to him. But you can't just give him everything, you must only bring the best quality foods, prepared to perfection. You must use your handy online recipe guide and conversation with the chef to determine whether the food is prepared properly.<br/></p>\n<p>For each food you accept, you'll be paying money, but for each food the Glutton enjoys you will be rewarded greatly. But if you deny good food, you will anger the serving chef and will be forced to pay for the meal anyways. Accept and deny each and every food carefully!</p>\n\n<p>I've been a hobbyist in GameDev for about 5 years now, but this is the first time I've submitted a game for a GameJam since I've recently started feeling more comfortable making good games within a time constraint, hopefully you guys enjoy what I've made! The theme for the jam was \"All that glitters is not gold\", so I tried to emphasize on the fact that you can't just serve the Glutton any food that comes across the table. Although at first the food looks appealing and delicious, there could be a minor/major problem hiding inbetween the dialogue, contents of the ingredients, etc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All assets are made by me, and the food sprites were drawn by my girlfriend (I drew the hamburger, you'll be able to tell).

Leave any comments if you have any questions/feedback!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T08:52:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/631/6310a2153161e4dcc722c59a2a6092e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ShoCo2"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
