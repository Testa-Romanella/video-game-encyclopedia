I actually caused a crash in earlier versions of my game because I didn't know how to properly manage tweens yet (shout out to Zaraza in the discord for helping me figure that out).</li><li>How, why, and when to preload resources that will be used later.</li><li>Not a ton. Honestly, I kind of played it safe with this game and stuck to stuff I already knew because I was testing out the new version of the engine and getting back into making games more generally after a long time off.</li></ul>\n<p>Things I would have liked to do given more time    </p>\n<ul><li>A way to wake up houses once they fall asleep, thereby gaining your parts back</li><li>More levels</li><li>More parts (other ideas were pinball-style flippers that threw the bombs away and a way to click on bombs to explode them early)</li><li>If those last two things were implemented, a points system where you could \"buy\" more parts.</li><li>Instead of the timer, my first idea was that the moon would travel across the sky to indicate the time left in the level.</li><li>Pausing. A settings menu.\u00a0 At the very least volume control (I'm sorry that it's loud).</li></ul>\n<p>At this point in the training I should dedicate two weeks to a game. I think with two full weeks I could build the  version that I initially envisioned. If I do, I will reupload it (after the jam voting period ends) and update this description accordingly.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-20T11:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/236/2361565376908d3f4a5dfb3f614bcb06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Happyfork"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
