During this time, the searching team waits outside. When the time expires, the doors open and you can search.<br/><br/>The hiding team can transform into various objects and has great movement speed.<br/><br/>To make it harder to find the player after turning into an object, there are various dynamic objects scattered on the map that change their position each time the map is loaded.<br/><br/>The search team runs slowly and has a narrow line of sight. They cannot see through objects, unlike the other team. <br/><br/>They have a special flashlight with which they can search for other players.<br/><br/>Both teams have a double jump.<br/><br/>In addition, there are mini-games on the map, for example, while the team that will be searching is waiting for the other team while they are hiding, you can play soccer.<br/>Also scattered on the map are various physical objects that you can interact with.<br/><br/>In closets, doors open - close. <br/>You can hide in the closet.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-19T01:21:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/024/0248eee0e88fca722563126a5ed2befe.jpg", "website": "http://llama.software/", "rating": 1.7, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 191, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 10, "suggestions_count": 303, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 10, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Blockman Go Studio", "Funny Games", "BRBG", "Llama Software", "JAMONG", "King of Games", "HIDY GAME"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Arcade", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Funny Games", "Llama Software", "Jamong", "King of Games", "HIDY GAME"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
