In the current version is nothing special, its still the prototype version. No saving, no real gameloop. I will add all of that in the next version.</p><p>Ideas and comments (especially on my recent devlog) are appreciated!</p>Disclaimer:\r\n<ul><li>At the moment this is more a prototype than a full game in any means.</li><li>The WebGL Version can be unstable! This game works fully on physics, so its cpu-hungry! (or maybe gpu, I'm not sure)</li><li>Dont insert to many coins at once at the some slot. It can generate problems!</li><li>This game is currently under development. So expect some more features in the near future!</li></ul>\r\nDescription:\r\n<p>If you have no arcade, kirmes or any other kind of amusement park nearby, here you can play to your hearts content. You will not loose any money, there are no in-ads to click/watch. There are no in-app pursaches or any sort of that.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Use 1, 2, 3, 4-keys to insert coins in those four slots. Watch and push some coins off!</p>\n\r\nNote:\r\n<ul><li>At a random time a coin will inserted. So you can just leave it running and something will happen.</li><li>There is no real gameloop in at the moment!</li><li>Because the game core mechanic works fully on Unity Physics, it can happen that some weird bugs, glitches, crude collisions can appear. I dont hope it will happen to often, let me know!</li><li>There is no game saving at the moment!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-06T05:09:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d049a8bedd670de0773d06e7fc28fdb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["koemii"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
