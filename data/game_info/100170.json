{"id": 100170, "slug": "port-blackfire", "name": "Port Blackfire", "name_original": "Port Blackfire", "description": "<p>Prologue game for a dark and naive pirate <strong>top-down graphical adventure</strong> with black and white aesthetic, similar to <strong>old pirate films</strong> such as <strong>\"Captain Blood\"</strong> (1935), \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940) etc...</p><p><strong>Music</strong>: Soundtrack \"Captain Blood\"</p><p>Fugal Episode from Prometheus</p><p>(1850, revised 1855) (uncredited)</p><p>Composed by Franz Liszt</p><p>Adapted and Re-orchestrated by Hugo Friedhofer and Erich Wolfgang Korngold</p><p>This game is the last one from a series of five made as assignments for the subject \"Game Tools\" at <strong>DIT Game Design degree course</strong>.</p><p>It has been my introductory course about tools used for game creation, mainly Unity. I was a complete newbie in the matter. It's hard to explain how I feel now after so many new things learned and so much time expended in this subject. Let's resume it: I wouldn't believe in Feb, which is the date I started, the fact that I'd be able to put everything together inside a game engine to produce a game like this. My knowledge and confidence in my skills as a game creator have reached levels never imagined before. I know, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, after all this game is just a small, simple mini-game, but for me it has meant so.</p><p>Even if the story is a bit naive (it's definitely the thing that I'd improve if I had more time), I think I have successfully reached my initial goal: creating a 2d game with an atmosphere similar to the old time pirate film classics. The inspiration came mainly from my teacher as she was the one who told me to create a game with such a title: <strong>\"Port Blackfire\"</strong>. Themes like pirates and games like \u201cThe secret of the Monkey Island\u201c came directly to my mind, but I was more inclined to do a top down game, in the line of <strong>\"Gauntlet\"</strong>, <strong>\"Into the Eagle's nest\"</strong> or <strong>\"Legend of Zelda\"</strong>. When I was convinced 100% about the idea of the old look, after the first prototypes, I thought about including some cinema reference, such as <strong>Sloth</strong> from <strong>\"The Goonies\"</strong> being the Pirate Bouncer (He is an avid consumer of old pirate films while chained in the Richard Donner's movie)</p><p>By the use of black/white assets, dust and scratches filters, vignettes, blurring and similar effects I created a quite convincing, in my opinion, old film image experience along with the use of cinematographic view compositions and transitions. The drastic effect of the old orchestra music helps a lot to transport your imagination to the universe of the game.</p><p>Hope that some of you will enjoy the short experience of playing this game. Thanks in advance. I might work a bit more on it to develop it a bit further.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/111/11100c4601d2db6ea33d409e22c8d445.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["nemonio"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
