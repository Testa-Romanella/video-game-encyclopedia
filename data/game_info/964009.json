Research, produce, buy and sell military equipment to optimize your armed forces and generate extra revenue. Each land unit is a battalion, each aircraft a squadron. Assemble battlegroups of combined force abilities to counter enemy tactics. Deploy your naval battlegroups as fleets to protect your maritime borders from naval landings by enemy nations. Load your units with far reaching missiles, either conventional or nuclear, to strike at the enemy from afar.<br/><br/><br/>Country management also requires managing relationships. Allies or enemies can be found next door or half way around the world. Sign treaties, trade commodities and share research to rise in power. Use covert operations to gain an intelligence edge or slow the progress of other nations through sabotage. But keep some of your spies in reserve, you might need to send them on counter-intel missions to cover your own assets.<br/><br/><br/>Manage all aspects of your country, right down to financial and supply chain needs.
