Death himself? And he said that you aren't supposed to be dead? What's happening?</p>\n<p>Are you going to choose to live and going back to your normal life, or stay and find out their secrets?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>- Gods! (No, just because they have horns, doesn't mean they're demons <em>smh</em>)</p>\n<p>- A lot of choices, like, a lot of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>- Somewhat cool title screen.</p>\n<p>- 5 Different endings to get! And 4 Cgs to get (You'll see why.)</p>\n<p>- (Soon) Extras! Ask them about stuff related to the game, or just insert some <em>secret</em> passwords...</p>\n<p>Optional, but if you're kind enough to drop some dollars, <strong>I'll add you in the list of available passwords!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>Winner of the 1st Rabico! Game jam.\u00a0The game is also available in Play store, but it's very outdated.\u00a0 I can't update the Play store version because:</p>\n<p>\u00a01. The Rabico! server is... <em>Well</em>, pretty much dying, which means, i can't export it to .aab format, and...</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 No access to pc...</p>\n\n<p>And that's why i decided to upload it here.</p>\n<p>Made from scratch with <strong>Rabico! Visual Novel engine</strong>, which is available in Play store!</p>\n<p>Please let me know if there's some bugs, I'll try to fix it right away!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>\n<p>- Save/Load is\u00a0<em>kind of</em> broken. It's a bug from the engine itself so, not sure how to fix it.</p>\n<p>- New fate button sometimes won't respond/opens settings instead. Still trying to figuring out the problem...</p><p>- Some compatibility issues. Again, the engine is quite limited. Maybe i really should port it one day...</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>\"It was your choice, after all.\"</strong></em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T14:24:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae0/ae01adcfe958923eef6aaaae336a768d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DepressoMocha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
