{"id": 852118, "slug": "marble-maze-tiiiiifani", "name": "Marble Maze (tiiiiifani)", "name_original": "Marble Maze (tiiiiifani)", "description": "<p>This is an exercise for my Game Engineering class. The assignment is to create a maze with collectibles and levels. I played around with creating prefabs to create benches, trees, fences, and more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One requirement\u00a0for the assignment was to create levels with increasing difficulty. On each level, I increased the difficulty by adding collectibles trapped in an enclosed fence that would unlock when a player finds a key. I also experimented with staircases and in the hardest level, the camera is rotated so from the player's perspective their controls are reversed.</p>\n<p>With increasing difficulty, I also wanted to create scenery that was appealing to the player. If you notice, the levels start to feel less like a maze and more like a scavenger hunt with obstacles. I think this subtle design change makes the game more enjoyable to play and it also let me become \"creative\" in a sense.\u00a0Another limitation was that\u00a0we could not use assets from the unity asset store, so all of the prefabs in this game are created with primitive types in unity. If I had more time in the future, I\u00a0would explore using UModeler, which is an asset on the unity store to create and edit\u00a0shapes. I would also explore Blender, which seems to be more powerful than UModeler.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Github</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T18:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0f1/0f12157a159c0e4f751f4adfe4e4a2e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 133, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tiiiiifani"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
