It is a game of table tennis. I made it free so you guys can enjoy the content, but\u00a0if you have any spare change, you can always donate it to me. Even just a dollar would help me a lot. If you think about it one dollar might not be a lot to you but to me it is a great help. I'm a 14 year old kid who could really enjoy some money. Thank you for downloading my game.</p><p><strong><em>Instructions :</em></strong></p><p><em>Left Padde : Up is \"W\" Down is \"S\"</em></p><p>Right Paddle : Up is \"Arrow Key\" Down is \"Arrow Key Down\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T03:03:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/856/856d801bae77278e4c74c49ae055c62b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neptub"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
