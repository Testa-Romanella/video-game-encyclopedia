You will have to play with lights and colors to solve the puzzles and free your little cube. However, be careful, the little cube's energy is limited and numerous dangerous traps are scattered in the 26 levels of Partycles.</p>\n<p>Levels go from easy to hard while teaching you tips and tricks to go further, some levels might rely more on luck than skill.</p>\n<p>This game is my first attempt at making a polished and finished game. Please enjoy playing it! Any feedback welcome! Please let me know  how much time you need to complete the game.</p>\n\n<p>Art by myself, KenneyNL and game-icons.net.
