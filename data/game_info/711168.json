A player can get pushed off platforms by push traps and can be attacked by enemies which sabotages the player\u2019s goal to collect keys.</li><li>Third Level - Created an additional level that appears to be more open along with different structures, and has to be followed through a course of enemies and traps making the difficulty and time spent on the level longer than the tutorial. Also has a series of checkpoints.</li></ol>\n<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT WAS NOT TESTED ON MAC OS.\u00a0The level 3 and overall load-in may take longer for the immensely large scene for level 3.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created through Coursera Program by Noah Mathew</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T04:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56c/56cbac6fe6bd7440ab2ecab10d3a3c23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["noahmathew14"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
