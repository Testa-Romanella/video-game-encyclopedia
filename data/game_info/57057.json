Unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature: several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability for every character to perform a double jump, run, and attack while running.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T04:53:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/76a/76a20b8f896d8549763be057d9a137ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 244, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Atlus"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
