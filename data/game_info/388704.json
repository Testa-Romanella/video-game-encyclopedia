The aim of this project was to create a game that would expand upon my portfolio of work. With all my previous projects being made in unity, I wanted to try making a game with the Unreal engine. At the end of the 7 week project, this is the result (during the semester I had three other units that I was studying as well, so this project wasn't my only focus during those 7 weeks).\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the game can easily be expanded upon (by adding in new guns, zombies, perks or even more levels), I probably will leave this project as complete and move onto more projects that I want to work on.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you want to keep up with any projects that I am working on, follow my twitter (@the94Gamer).</p>\n<p>Or view my work on my portfolio\u00a0here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T03:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7de/7de56f834df5337aa1c7e0e0f03c4bf7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 170, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["the94Gamer"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
