{"id": 952079, "slug": "brewmastery-tavern-simulator", "name": "Brewmastery: Tavern Simulator", "name_original": "Brewmastery: Tavern Simulator", "description": "Build your own medieval brewery with a full set of realistic equipment and get the most out of all the intricacies of making drinks. From harvesting to malting, from brewing to aging, fermentation, filtration, and finally serving your drinks to Tavern guests. Immerse yourself in the entertaining process of brewing through all the stages. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you play, you'll have to develop the old Tavern, which you inherited from your uncle, and turn it into the best place in this magical land! You have two floors and dozens of functional rooms that can be upgraded and changed to your liking. An authentic brewery on two floors will not leave anyone indifferent. Upgrade your equipment and keep an eye on its wear and tear, because the quality of your drinks depends on it!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom your own vegetable garden on the adjoining grounds where you can grow ingredients, to the noisy and fun Tavern Hall, where music plays and beer pours like a river. From the impressive two-story brewery filled with all sorts of brewing equipment to the cozy player's bedroom, which houses a secret study that opens up as the building evolves. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut that's not all. The story-oriented simulator allows you to plunge into the vibey atmosphere of the fantasy world, where the guests of the Tavern will share their stories with the player, tell the latest gossip of the local lands, as well as give tasks, by completing which you can improve your reputation and make the Tavern a well-known place. Entertaining quests will give you freedom of choice, where every decision you make will be reflected in the course of events. Accidentally (not really) dropped a fly amanita into the vat with the Governor's favorite beer, a local regular, or overheated the malt? Get ready for the consequences \u2013 both fun and not so fun! The player writes the history of the Tavern with his decisions.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-07T05:08:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ae/2ae3ce2a00ca0a9673d0259225891cde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 276, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rave Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rave Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
