You have limited resources, so keep an eye on how much water, fertilizer, and seeds\u00a0you have left and use them wisely to grow your garden before you run out of actions.</p>\n<p>There's also a creative mode where you have enough resources\u00a0to grow whatever you want :)</p>\r\nControls<ul><li>Use right and left arrow keys to move.</li><li>Hover over a plant button to see how much water and fertilizer that crop needs to grow and how many coins you can earn from it. Each button shows how many more times you can use that action.</li><li>Once a crop is planted, an indicator will hover over it to show you how much water and fertilizer it still needs or how many coins you earned from it if it's fully grown.</li><li>Each patch of soil affects your crops in different ways, which are shown in the bottom left corner of the screen. For example, a +1 next to the fertilizer icon means that a crop planted in that soil will require one extra fertilizer to grow.</li><li>Earn enough coins to fill your quota and win the level! You can always restart or try a different level if you get stuck.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T07:27:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/4123439866190ea8341fbbdfef850d4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shimmerscale"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
