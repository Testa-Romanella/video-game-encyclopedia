It is a bedroom with 3 doors and 1 window. The decoration is not bad. There is an aquarium with a fish in it and other objects that are very ordinary. You look outside of the window and see a garden. Then you want to leave the room. But you can\u2019t. All the doors are locked. What are you going to do? Use your brain. Or ask the fish.</p>\n<p>Game Engine: Unity\r\n Blender and Audacity\r\n  </p>\n<p>Genre: Escape Room Survival / FPS Survival / Suffering</p>\n<p>Imported Assets:\r\n  </p>\n<p>Ceiling Sound: \"Ceiling Fan .wav\" (https://freesound.org/people/zmadyun/sounds/343793/) by zmadyun is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\r\n  \r\n  </p>\n<p>Aquarium: \"Fishless Aquarium\" (https://skfb.ly/ooOIA) by Gabriela_Ojeda is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Toilet: \"Toilet\" (https://skfb.ly/6uFxX) by Xill is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Sink: \"Unseen: Bathroom Sink\" (https://skfb.ly/6ZLK7) by JmCVoyager is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Toilet Paper: \"Simple Toilet Paper 2.0\" (https://skfb.ly/6CXT7) by Blender3D is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Screwdriver: \"Screwdriver (Low Poly, Game Ready)\" (https://skfb.ly/6XDNB) by Skript47 is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Boots: \"Boots\" (https://skfb.ly/6TqGM) by dynastro is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Seagull Head: \"Seagull\" (https://skfb.ly/6YPtR) by Bwinji Shamutete is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Military Kit : \"Military Character Kit 1.0 (CC0)\" (https://skfb.ly/ooHXY) by britdawgmasterfunk is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Motorcycle: \"Classic Motorcycle\" (https://skfb.ly/6WPGW) by DeclanLea14 is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Garage Door: \"Giftbringer Garage Door\" (https://skfb.ly/6XtDQ) by Liam Moffitt is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n  </p>\n<p>Mermaild: \"Mermaid 3DScan\" (https://skfb.ly/6WPyW) by Sakchai.Sompila is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T03:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf1/cf1022530b39f9686c48fa73f587192c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kharalos"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
