{"id": 58585, "slug": "fallout-76", "name": "Fallout 76", "name_original": "Fallout 76", "description": "<p>Fallout 76 is a multiplayer-only game set in the universe of Fallout series. It is the first MMO game in the Fallout franchise and ninth installment overall. It is also the earliest game in the Fallout universe inner chronology, thus serving as a prequel to the whole series.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, a quarter century after a nuclear holocaust that turned most of the US into a radioactive wasteland. The players assume the roles of the various dwellers of Vault 76, presumably the first Vault-Tec bunker to release its inhabitants. Their goal is to reclaim the world. The vault is located in the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia. Fallout 76 offers an open world with many locations based on real West Virginia places. Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks. V.A.T.S. targeting system also appears, albeit this time it works in real-time. The game allows the players to build homes and establish settlements in any part of the map. There are also nuclear missiles that allow the players to annihilate each other&#39;s settlements.</p>", "metacritic": 51, "released": "2018-11-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T21:44:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/151/151e79f397328419c64aabe93d9d5a31.jpg", "website": "https://bethesda.net/en/article/679r4grSp2IckQk4Ac2yKO/fallout-76-official-teaser-trailer", "rating": 2.86, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 141, "owned": 2834, "beaten": 82, "toplay": 177, "dropped": 386, "playing": 109}, "playtime": 6, "achievements_count": 421, "ratings_count": 629, "suggestions_count": 396, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 639, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "PC"], "developers": ["Bethesda Game Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
