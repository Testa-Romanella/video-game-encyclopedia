But no more! Gobbler, the\r\nlittle pink tuna, is tired of being the prey! He may be small now, but with his\r\nplucky determination and odd metabolism, he\u2019s going to eat up the competition\r\nand get bigger till he reaches the top of the food chain!</p>\n<p>The rules of the ocean are simple: run into smaller fish to\r\neat them up and get bigger, and avoid the bigger fish to avoid getting\r\npulverized and sent to fish-heaven. The bigger you get, the more fish you can\r\neat, until the only thing that can threaten you is the Shark. But get big\r\nenough, and you can even make this apex predator your prey! Then you\u2019ll start\r\nover to do it all again, till poor Gobbler finally joins that big blue ocean in\r\nthe sky for good. But hey, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll at least have gotten a high\r\nscore and had your moment as king of the sea!</p>\n<p>Uses Spritelib, the free collection of sprites made by Ari\r\nFeldman: http://www.widgetworx.com/spritelib/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/631/631fe971331c2d3fea5783e5e9a65957.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragon King Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
