Are you ready to control a little robot to save your planet? The humans made the entire planet discolored and now you are here to save it. There is no color on the planet so you have to go find it into the Galaxy Colorado. Collect as much as you can, trade with the aliens and upgrade your robot. Also you move only with the recoil of your bullets (you have no fuel system so that's the way you move).\u00a0Also bring home as much color as possible.\r\n<br/>\r\nThis game was made for GDKO Game Jam - Round 1<br/>\r\nThe game is not fully completed because I don't have enough time to finish it.
