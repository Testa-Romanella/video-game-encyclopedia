The theme of the jam was <strong>reflection</strong>, which inspired me to use souls as a concept, since they are reflections of the self. The limitation of the jam was\u00a0<strong>windows as a mechanic</strong>, so I created literal windows to the spirit world in which you can collect the lost souls. This is my very first game jam, so I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>WASD / Arrow Keys \u2014\u00a0</strong>Move</li><li><strong>Space \u2014 </strong>Jump</li><li><strong>E \u2014\u00a0</strong>Interact</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T08:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b01/b017f511c8ed52a5fa5423029ce4e543.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rose Mage Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
