The Theme is \"Joined Together\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is a small game (think the scale of a single Mario Party minigame) designed for two players, though there is also an\u00a0AI available if you would like to play alone.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Two players are chained together at a fixed distance and direction. When one walks one way, the other is dragged with them. Dodge the projectiles flying across the screen, while trying to drag your opponent into them.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Very short rounds (seconds long), and quick restarts to keep the action going for as long as you like.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also includes a timer if you would like to play co-operatively (or if you're alone, with either an AI or solo mode where you control both characters) to survive as long as possible.\u00a0Your best score is saved when the game is closed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0made this game like this because this is the first weekend since I've moved in with my girlfriend, so I wanted to keep my project this year simpler so I could spend more time with her. Also this was something we could play together, and our playtests were a lot of fun. Hopefully you can enjoy this game with someone else, or if you don't have anyone to play with you I hope you can have some fun with it on your own. Please let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/651/651efeb1cef07ca4df1c5aafd5daff00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ninto55"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
