All the dynamites in the world have promised to blow \"it\" all the way to the other side of heaven. Maybe you think it's no problem since \"it\" can only smash them to pieces... Unfortunately \"it\" is rather weak... very weak. The only thing \"it\" can do is to run run and run til the dynamites have ignited or surrounded you.</p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>Avoid touching dynamites at all cost. Collect diamonds to unlock super dashes which will become your best friend when surrounded by enemies. Red diamonds will reset and respawn all the diamonds so collect them in order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>A,D - Steer the player<br/>W - Turbo speed (drains stamina)<br/>S - Brake (preserves stamina )<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Space while jumping - Super dash for a long distance. Limited number of jumps. Reward each time you clear all crystals.<br/>TAB - Show Control/Tutorial view.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>First game jam ever. The current of state of the game is far from what I imagined in the beginning of the jam. I had many plans to implement ragdoll physics, achievement system, multiple enemies/threats and other cool mechanics. All of which seemed very feasible at that time but unfortunately things came in between and I didn't have the time that I had expected to spend with it. Further more the model of the main character that I had spent countless hours working on became corrupted at the late hours and the current art is mostly placeholder art (especially main character). But I think I at least got the atmosphere and basic MVP of the idea that I imagined in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>\n<p>* Unity</p>\n<p>* Blender</p>\n<p>* Photoshop</p>\n<p>* FL Studio</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>--- V1.2</strong></p>\n<p>Fixed UI bugs and UI that wasn't enabled i v.1</p>\n<p>Also game speed was much slower in build than in editor.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T03:59:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa49ed4d9bef9fe1baaea2cd6e979ec5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vildas"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
