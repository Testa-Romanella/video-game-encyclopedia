To expand, they must build bridges to other sky islands containing the resources they need. Since these islands exists within the Troposphere (the area of the Earth's atmosphere where all weather happens), they are prone to frequent natural disasters. To combat these dangers, players must build fortifications against these disasters before they reach a resource. Failure to defend can be a major setback in the player's expansion. The game is set in levels with goals for population, exploration, and time. Build and expand your village as fast as you can!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHeadphones highly recommended for the optimal game experience.\r\n</p><p>If you've enjoyed this game and want to be notified of updates or just want to support us, like us on Facebook: https://m.facebook.com/TroposphereGame</p><p>This game was made by students in the Michigan State Game Design Program over the course of 5 weeks.\r\n</p><p>**Winner of the Michigan State University 2015 Student Game Showcase Best of Show Award**</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/791/791737a58886dcbb3bbf3e48bbdc9f59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Elan_Gleiber"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
