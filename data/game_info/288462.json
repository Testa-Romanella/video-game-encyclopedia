Ten years later I rediscovered it among some old files. With some tweaks and updates I am finally releasing it to the world for free (although you're more than welcome\u00a0to donate some coinage if you like the game).</p>\n<p>So what is the game about? Well, you play as Inky (an octopus) who is trying to get his hotdog back from some thieving woodpeckers. In space. Platforming shenanigans ensue.</p>\n<p>Is it a great game? Nah. But considering I was only 12-13 at the time it's a miracle it's as unbroken as it is. And despite all the fixes and such the game still remains true to it's original form.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As simple as the game is it holds a certain amount of charm, at least to me. When I made it I was very limited in what I could do (due to my ignorance of programming and such), but ironically those limitations helped to make a game that isn't bogged down with unnecessary bullsh*t. You can quite literally start playing the moment it finishes loading up until you complete it.</p>\n<p>So I present to you a challenge - can you work your way through all 43 levels to get your hotdog back? Considering there's no save feature and that many of the levels are tough as nails I kinda doubt it.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>2D platforming action</li><li>That's really it...</li><li>Oh, you get to stomp on the woodpeckers, that's pretty cool</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>If you have a computer with XP or above you can run this, if you can't you really need to get a new computer</li><li>No idea if it runs on computers past Windows 7 though</li><li>Lots of patience</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:31:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/408/408eafbf9cd325517779e56ed6a33fa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["owltowel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
