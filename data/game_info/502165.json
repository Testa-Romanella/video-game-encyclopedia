But as you move through the game, that solution is more and more deeply hidden.<br/><br/>You'll never wonder <strong>how </strong> to do something, you'll only wonder <strong>what</strong> you need to do.<br/><br/>Enjoy exploring unusual environments and learn to work strange mechanisms.<br/><br/>Relax in the knowledge that Zof is non-linear.
