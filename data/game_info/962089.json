Government and its military have been wiped out leaving survivors to fend for themselves.  The Children of Arms carve out their territory, mowing down the living and undead alike. The Purified seek to rid the world of feeders and humanity itself through fire. The Marauders wreak havoc, taking what they want and partying \u2018til the end of it all.
