If you connect the first deposit to the river,<strong> you can drain the water out into the river</strong> so you don't have to worry about it. <strong>Do not let the water overflow and good luck.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T06:31:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/975/975a0c2e8df755396fe76dc4b49d3135.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Furoppi games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
