To achieve this, you can increase your element movement speed through buffs. However, it should be noted that some debuffs may cause damage to your element or affect its speed. Also, the leading player is not necessarily the winner, because when the game starts, there will be a huge firewall in both forward and backward directions. When your element walks too fast or too slow, it will be attacked by the firewall. Therefore, whether it is debuffs or firewalls, it will hinder your element from moving forward.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Mechanics</strong>\n<p>Competition: The goal of each player is to get the winning point first. Therefore, players need can use buffs on the map to get faster than others. Not only that, but the map also has debuffs and two firewalls that will prevent players from walking too fast or too slow, causing pressure on the players.\r\n</p>\n<p>Comparison: Each player can see where the opponent is, so the level of other game players can be measured, which brings fun and excitement to the players.\r\n</p>\n<p>Multiplayer: players are hostile to each other, but they have the same goal of victory.\r\n</p>\n<p>Human-computer interaction: Players interact with objects on the map, such as fire, grass, etc. When the player encounters different objects, different effects will be produced, such as acceleration, deceleration, etc.\r\n</p>\n<p>Balance: The allocation of buffs and debuffs in the game is fair to every player.\r\n</p>\n<p>Player controller: Player use the keyboard to control their elements in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>Choices: Path choices allow the players to choose their path and, the choices of the player might affect the outcomes of the game.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Game Control and design</strong>\n<strong>Game Control</strong>\n<p>Movement\r\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>In-game GUI</strong>\n<p>The GUI will feature the following information:\r\n</p>\n<p>1. A countdown screen will appear before the game starts.\r\n</p>\n<p>2. Every player will have a health or hit points bar on their head.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Characters</strong>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Element/Objects</strong>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Map/Area Designers</strong>\n<p>The map provides different paths for players to choose from. Each road will have different buffs or debuffs to affect the player\u2019s progress. In order to make the game fairer, almost every road will have two different results:\r\n</p>\n<p>Results 1: A beneficial effect on the player\u00a0 OR No effect on the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>Results 2: An adverse effect on the player\u00a0 OR No effect on the player.\r\n</p>\n<p>Results 3: A beneficial effect on the player\u00a0 OR An adverse effect on the player (This result will not happen)\r\n</p>\n<p>There will be a moving firewall on the map. This firewall can prevent the leading player from walking too fast or the lagging player from walking too slowly.\r\n</p>\n<p>The map style is generally cute and concise pixel style, and the objects on the map have a clear style, which is convenient for players to identify.\r\n</p>\n<p>Placing different buffs and debuffs on the map to increase the fun of players walking on the map. The background map is transformed according to the four seasons, which reduces the boring feeling when players are walking the map.\r\n</p>\n<strong>Wix Website</strong>\n<p>https://jay0715.wixsite.com/website</p>\n\r\nReferences\r\n<p>Tilemap</p>\n<p>https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack</p>\n<p>Background Music</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/game-music-action-aggressive-pounding-and-tense-e...</p>\n<p>Most sound effects are from</p>\n<p>https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/video-game/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T19:18:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a59/a59311a805973c97b6da30f3908e373e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bingling"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
