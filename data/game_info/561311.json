Here we have two players , controlled with WASD and Arrows respectively, unable to stray too far from one another, forcing the players to match their movements.\u00a0It comes with its own set of challenges and difficulties but we feel like it can give a fun and fresh experience to players.<br/><br/>Because of the small team size this project is very small scale and serves more as a prototype for our mechanic than a full fledged game. We don't have any custom sound or artwork and there is only one, very simple at that, level.<br/><br/>Still, we hope that you can look at the core of the experience we're trying to demo and see the potential!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T05:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ca/0ca8b8703dc8ed3ec9a9a4a599a11e49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aminamina", "0wler"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
