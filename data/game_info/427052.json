You have one purpose in life - bringing back little boy's lost toy.\u00a0In\u00a0order\u00a0to do\u00a0this,\u00a0you\u00a0will\u00a0build sand-structures\u00a0with collected\u00a0molds\u00a0and\u00a0gather\u00a0sand\u00a0along\u00a0the\u00a0way. You will grow big, strong and fast. But watch out for crabs! They will hit you and you will lose your sand! When you collect all the molds, you will have to build a sand-castle - big enough to climb the top of the cliff and bring back the boy's toy. Be wary and hurry. A big wave that will destroy all your constructs and take back the toy into the depths of the sea IS COMING!!! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T06:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e88/e88c1a1c047dc75221c4109554523c87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Janku"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
