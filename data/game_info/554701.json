Players travel to four different habitats: The Tide Pool, the Savanna, the rain forest, and the temperate forest.</p>\n<p>In each location, the user must fill out Contest Sheets and complete mini-games. Whenever an animal is clicked, it will explain various facts about itself. Some animals also have mini-games associated with them, like the white-tailed deer, and some animals have songs associated with them like Big Gray the rhino.</p>\n<p>The Contest Sheets consist of pages containing blank spaces for 6 photos, each blank space labeled with an animal descriptor such as &quot;Carnivore&quot; or &quot;Makes its own shell&quot;. The user must take photos of animals that match the descriptions and place them in the correct spaces.</p>\n<p>After finding all the animals, completing all the mini-games, and filling out the Contest Sheets, the player will receive a reward. The player can then collect stickers and craft ideas to print out.</p>\n<p>There are three difficulty levels.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2002-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T14:39:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a48/a48819d55cba4080ea5b97e6e22c5787.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 149, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Knowledge Adventure"], "genres": ["Educational", "Family"], "publishers": ["Knowledge Adventure"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
