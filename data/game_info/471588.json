I did my own thing without using references beyond memory, so it's not an exact clone as much as a personal recreation. Also I guess it's in space!</p>\n<p>I may come back to update this in minor ways, some listed here:</p>\n<ul><li>Add sound effects and maybe a title screen track</li><li>Make it so time actually stops when paused</li><li>Not sure if I'm satisfied with turning one direction twice, might tweak it so you can't die by turning around like that</li><li>Make the screen-wrap effect\u00a0smoother</li><li>Make the embed look nicer in itch.io</li></ul>\n<p>And there you have it! For now, this is what it is and I'm happy with it. I hope you enjoy. :3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:22:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b78/b780ab547bdb88e047d07ab11d879309.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PerilousFeral"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
