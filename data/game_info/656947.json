This\u00a0 game is a strategy/management game where you need to manage\u00a0 \u00a0a bunch of clocks\u00a0 \u00a0throughout\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0ingame week. The clocks gears break mess up over time and you need to wind them back up. You lose if you break more then one clock and you win if you get to 1PM.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The theme of the jam is Let There Be Chaos. This game is very chaotic. It starts of very simple but through the different shifts the clocks\u00a0 break faster and your employer,\u00a0 Clock Maker adds more clocks to your room. This game was made in only seven days so some parts of the game are a little ruff around the edges\u00a0 , but mostly its a fun time and I recommend playing it.</p>\n\n<p>Controls</p>\n<p>Left Click - Interact</p>\n<p>X - Close Clock Menu</p>\n\n<p>(Note. if you want to restart a shift dont spam x multiple times only press it once at the end of the shift)</p>\n\n<p>This game incudes extra\u00a0 and fun features such as</p>\n<p>-Dialogue/Tutorial</p>\n<p>-Achievements and Local\u00a0 save for them</p>\n<p>-Extremely hard gameplay and high difficulty curve</p>\n<p>-Pretty nice 3d graphics + Post Processing</p>\n\n<p>Please leave a rating/comment/feedback for my game and rate it at:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-6</p>\n<p>Also check out other amazing projects that where submitted for the game jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-22T10:05:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92f/92ffe3fa84d3a16e7b66d0f7e96ddc50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["AwesomeBird"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
