It is heavily inspired by NimSony's TinyGTA early prototype. The movement of the character might be a bit buggy and I might release some more updates to this project. It currently features a small space to play in and spawnable bot characters which simply stand up after a few seconds when they have been hit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-19T03:57:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7dc/7dc210d9f904ff0103f414d99766a3e8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["willemsteller"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
