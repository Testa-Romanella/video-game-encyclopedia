It is in the same universe as\u00a0The Dust of the Violet Crystals and\u00a0Vogvhathos.</p>\r\nStoryline:\r\n<p>You've been tasked with collecting data on an alien planet. Choose between exploring the jungle tropics, or navigating deep into the bioluminescent sea.<br/></p>\r\nGameplay:\r\n<p>Telvoikai is a role-playing game where almost every choice will affect the story in some way. Will you choose to provide your crew with as much data as possible, or simply enjoy your newfound freedom from the ship? Will you choose to romance a crew member, a friend... an alien? Or ignore romance and only focus on exploring?</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on the ever-changing scales of your fate, as the story has many ways it can end. Good luck!</p>\r\nMeet the Crew\r\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCaithe:\r\n<p>Fascination with science led to her begging to transfer to lower floor labs to experiment freely.
