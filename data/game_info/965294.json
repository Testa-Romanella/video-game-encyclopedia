This uplink station contains vital intel and must not fall into the wrong hands. Every time a team loses a round, they come back better equipped with better weapons, gear and equipment. This game is perfect for a party of casual shooter players, with tight physics based gun mechanics and fast paced round.<br/><br/><br/>NOTE: This game is developed nearly entirely by one person, content updates may be slow and sporadic and bugs may still exist due to the limited resources available to testing the game.
