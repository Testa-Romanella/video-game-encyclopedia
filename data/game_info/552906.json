{"id": 552906, "slug": "rock-paper-uno", "name": "Rock, Paper, Uno!", "name_original": "Rock, Paper, Uno!", "description": "Rock, Paper, Uno!\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>What's that?</strong></p>\n<p>It's a\u00a0card-style fighting game using the rules of rock, paper, scissors and UNO! (Made in about 24hrs. Well, about 4 hours, sometimes 5,\u00a0per day after work for 5 days.)\u00a0</p><p>This game is intentionally design to be short, so short you can actually win within the first 30 seconds if you get a good roll of the die. The goal with this game was for me to see if this idea would work as a game and as a fighting game.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>I had a blast making the game and I am looking forward to updating the game to include a better combo system, counters, breakers, and specials.\u00a0Additionally, looking to remove as much RNG as possible to give players a better possibility to strategize.</p><p><strong>Thanks for playing!\u00a0<br/></strong>Please share your thoughts and give me feedback on what you would improve on or add to the game. I will take all feedback in consideration when further working on this game.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Theme Interpretation</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to make a LESS complicated fighting game where I could enjoy MORE of the excitement of doing combos and winning a round.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also the game is short and simple\u00a0 :)</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>The game is made up of 3 rounds where your goal is to be the first player to have the least total\u00a0cards by the final round or get to zero cards by or before it. Each round consists of the Rock, Paper, Scissor followed by the UNO style Combos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, you start each round by choosing all the cards you want to play first and then clicking on the \"Fight!\" button to initiate the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Rock, Paper, Scissor (Battle)</strong></p>\n<p>Your first select card battles against\u00a0 the opponent's first selected card in a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissor:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Rock beats scissor</li><li>Paper beats rock</li><li>Scissor beats paper</li></ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Say your hand looks like this:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>You decide to go with \"Rock\" to start the battle, however you also need to choose all cards you want to play for this round. To keep this simple, I will show you which one to choose later.</p>\n<p>Once you have chosen all the cards, you click on \"Fight!\" to start the battle.</p>\n<p>Now, the opponent chooses \"scissor\" to start with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 VS\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Going by the rules of RPS, you defeat the opponent's scissor and now enter into the \"Combo\" state.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Combo State</strong></p>\n<p>This is part two of the battle where the other cards you selected will either \"combo\" into additional hits or miss. Here is where UNO rules come into play as they stack up in sequentially. Using the hand mentioned above, if you selected the cards in this order:</p>\n<p>1\u00a0\u00a02\u00a0\u00a0 3\u00a0\u00a0 4 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Then your cards will combo because:</p>\n<ul><li>Yellow Rock is the same \"value\" (rock) as the green rock you started with</li><li>Yellow Paper is the same \"color\" (yellow) as the yellow rock</li><li>Lastly Red Paper is the same \"value\" (paper) as the yellow paper\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>In order to combo the next card has to either be the same color or the same type as the last card that was played.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button or Tap to select/deselect your cards</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Assets made by me<ul><li>All programming, design, card images, sound effects, and voice overs</li></ul><ul><li>Hand drew the characters and used Photoshop to touch them up</li></ul><ul><li>Record all sounds/voice overs using Audacity</li></ul></li><li>Assets not made by me:<ul><li>Music is from the \"Layered Rock Music Pack\" Unity Asset Store</li></ul><ul><li>Font is from 1001fonts.com<ul><li>Piedra Font</li><li>Chock A Block NF Font</li><li>Tinsnips Font</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T15:51:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/34f/34fbd778d3ca26adfe3717197c2c6998.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ProdigalSon Games"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
