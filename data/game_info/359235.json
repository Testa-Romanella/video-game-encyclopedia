I pick up the jar of salt again. The refreshing coolness of the glass trinket fills me with newfound confidence. And as I'm sitting there, an inexplicable urge arises within me to stand up with a loud cry, and chuck the little jar against the wall of the restaurant, just above the table where the they're sitting, so that they're showered by salt and broken glass.<br/><br/>I can clearly picture the fearful looks in their eyes, the girl scared to death, the small guy startled, and the big one with a spasmodic, stupid grin on his face. A tingling triumph starts to bubble through my limbs. I'm breaking out in sweat, and I clench the jar firmly in my fist, as it gives me strength.<br/><br/>The glass between my fingers has fogged up completely.\"", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65d/65d47824763d1ed38d02132de9338593.jpg", "website": "https://www.socah.org/raintime/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["socah development"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["socah"], "esrb_rating": null}
