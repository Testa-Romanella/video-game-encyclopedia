{"id": 898297, "slug": "dd214-dash-f2022-team-5", "name": "DD214 Dash (F2022 Team 5)", "name_original": "DD214 Dash (F2022 Team 5)", "description": "<p><strong>Description:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>DD-214 Dash is an endless runner inspired by Temple Run where veterans are chasing bureaucrats who have stolen their discharge papers (DD-214). The goal behind DD-214 dash is to test (and potentially treat) Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex and Convergence disorders in patients who have experienced traumatic brain injuries.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A DD-214 is a Department of Defense Document 214: Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. The DD-214 represents an active duty service member\u2019s separation from the military and has obtained a meme-status within the services. The joke of the meme is that the DD-214 protects a service member from the military\u2019s bureaucracy and is also understood within the military\u2019s reserve components.\r\n</p>\n<p>The overall goal in DD-214 Dash is to catch the bureaucrats who have stolen your DD-214.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><strong>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are three game modes: VOR, Convergence, and VOR + Convergence Combined:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>In VOR mode, turn your head in the direction that you want to go in order to avoid incoming obstacles. A\u00a0\"C\" symbol will briefly appear on the back of the players head. Try to move the joystick such that it matches the exact symbol you saw, and then hit the trigger button to confirm your answer. Once you do this, your player will either successfully move to the lane that you chose, or they will stay in the center lane if you chose the incorrect symbol.\r\n</li><li>In Convergence mode, a clipboard will be thrown at you with a screen of black and white dots. On this black and white dotted screen, you should be able to make out a shape resembling an oval (that appears to stand out in front of the screen). The side of the screen that the oval appears on indicates the direction that you should turn your head in order to avoid the obstacle. Once the clipboard disappears, move your head in the direction (either left or right) that you saw the oval appear in. If you move your head in the correct direction, then the player will move lanes to that side. If you move your head in the wrong direction however, then the player will stay in the center lane, causing you to lose health.\r\n</li><li>In the combined VOR + Convergence mode, a clipboard will appear, and you should turn your head in the direction of the appearing oval as in the Convergence mode described above. After you turn your head\u00a0however your player will not immediately move, rather, a \"C\" symbol will then briefly appear, just as it does in the VOR mode. Then, select the correct symbol with your joystick and the trigger button. If you chose the right lane and the right symbol, then the player will move to that lane. Otherwise, your player will stay in the center lane and lose health.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>See tutorial video for visual explanation of controls:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T17:39:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ec/6ecba44d7e1f64f386afc2971cb6d968.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["CWRU-ECSE390"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
