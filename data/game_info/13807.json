Life is harsh in the desert and players must explore and discover the supplies needed for survival. Although the desert is vast, players have the opportunity of discover outposts, villages, camps, and ancient ruins, and will have to deal with the wild-life and local populations of the area. Players must scavenge for tools and weapons, and must hunt for food to survive. Players are free to explore and discover the environment as they see fit, but they must be careful as the inhabitants of the area will treat them according to their behaviour. Badiya is built around the three key gameplay pillars of exploration, activities, and combat.FEATURES<ul><li>Infinite Procedural Open World: Every time you play you will see different looking terrain, events, enemy encounters, and items to loot.<br/></li><li>Time of Day System: A full 24 hour cycle is available.
