Fighting against a timer which represents the public\u2019s dwindling faith in the ability of the player to protect them, the player must look over case files, conduct DNA tests, develop film, and interrogate suspects. To beat the clock, players must use their resources and intuition to decide what pieces of evidence are significant, which can be ignored and ultimately, who they believe is responsible for the crime. But the player must be cautious as charging the wrong person could have dire consequences.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T11:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be3/be392d530b1481103b2991f01bda44bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tteokhobi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
