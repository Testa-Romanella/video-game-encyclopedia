Both versions were bundled and sold together as one package for the North American release, while Japan and Europe only saw the Sega CD version being released. For the North American version, both discs were required to play the 32X CD version, which demonstrated a rare attempt to implement DRM protection in a console which had no copy protection at all. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f308b5d824ae8f047edc0a998a587b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 3, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 9, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 306, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["SEGA CD", "SEGA 32X"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
