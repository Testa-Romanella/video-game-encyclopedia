You must collect coins and items within each level. Packed with magic support, you&#39;ll fight the bosses at the end of each world. A nice game that unfortunately has a story that is in Japanese, but this will not stop anyone from playing and enjoying this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-06T02:36:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/954/954673c4ca5a6a6e690158c898a43b5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lizsoft"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": ["Self-Published"], "esrb_rating": null}
