I always loved the mazelike feel of oldschool 3D dungeon crawlers, so I decided to make my own endless dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Endless procedurally generated levels</p>\n<p>No in-game maps, grab some paper to map it yourself!</p>\n<p>Loot: Armor, weapons, potions, keys, and gold!</p>\n<p>Score value of levels completed once you die</p>\n<p>Contols:</p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Hold I to view inventory</p>\n<p>Mouse left and right click in combat</p>\n<p>Left click to pick up an item, right click to discard it</p>\n<p>R to restart game</p>\n<p>ESC to save and quit, game will automatically start where you left off</p>\n<p>Unfinished:</p>\n<p>As an older project primarily made for personal enjoyment, I have no plans to make this into a polished game. Elements of the game may look unpolished, but it is all fully playable.</p>\n<p>This game isn't for everyone, but if you're in the mood to map some grid-based dungeons, break out that graph paper!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:38:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b7/0b738b2790c6735ad057a45c1021ec29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameClimb"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
