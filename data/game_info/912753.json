Plunging into the abyss, he falls for what feels like years. Upon reaching the bottom, a mysterious force allows him to land like a feather. A darkness creeps around him. Where was he? How long had he been falling? Who was he? The boy\u2019s thoughts were abruptly interrupted as he was suddenly attacked by foreign creatures. Instinctively, the boy fought. The creatures kept coming. Blinded by bloodlust and the will to find answers, he continued killing anything that neared him, with power he didn\u2019t know he had. More questions flood his consciousness. Then strangely, everything stops. The boy then hears someone humming. He turns and finds a strange human-like figure standing before him. Pleased to have caught the boy's attention, the figure clears its throat: \u201cAhem- well, boy. To answer your questions, you\u2019ll have to find your way to the absolute bottom of the well.\u201d With that, the figure vanished, revealing a door behind it. Although it was a quick interaction the boy is satisfied with this new development and with nowhere else to go, the boy steps through the door with one intention: Reach the bottom.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T15:41:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/99b/99b3dde2c5efb2bc46e83b6a859b08b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rivszn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
