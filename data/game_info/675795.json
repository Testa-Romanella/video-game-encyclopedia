They have been suffering years in the circus, but now they're free and want to find their new home. Help them find the way to the bamboo forest where they could be safe. It won't be so easy, because of the earthquakes and falling rocks. The ground is unstable, the terrain is rough and the hills are high...but don't despair these little ones are strong! But be careful - pandas can lose their mind and become angry without some food. With the help of a panda-chef you can heal them, safe more pandas and get more scores.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T10:32:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3ddda93c9a36b84309e819c4b6cc6a41.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ServAlex"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
