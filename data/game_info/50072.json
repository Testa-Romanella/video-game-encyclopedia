Hi, that's me!<br/><br/>Feedback is not only appreciated, but encouraged. This is not a \"complete and done game\". For the next few months I will update it with new balance, new enemies and new... well, almost anything you - the player - wishes to see in the game, as long as it is feasable considering the budget I have for this game. Which means: the more it sells, the more I can invest in improving it!<br/><br/>Have you found it too easy? Wants to see something different? Saw something you didn't like? Let me know, and I'll do my best to work on it!<br/><br/>Thank you for your time. I hope you have fun!<br/> - JMBeraldo, Eridanus Studio", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/214/214a1383947648b52c03c4b0c255ae51.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/eridanusstudio/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 48, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 145, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eridanus Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Eridanus Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
