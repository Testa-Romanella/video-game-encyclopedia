Well, now you can!</p>\n<p>This is V1 and may receive updates, we had to release it slightly early because of the amount of shit that got leaked (past dev uploaded a build on gamejolt without permission) so I'm sorry if something you've seen isn't in this build. Thanks a LOT for checking out this mod though.</p>\n<p>Also, it might be a bit buggy so make sure to give us bug reports if you find any!</p>\n<p>(btw the mod is capped at 60 frames since it'd break a lot of stuff if it was uncapped)</p>\n<p>If you'd like to join our discord server then here:</p>\n<p>https://discord.gg/Zk3M4dvRDT</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>So basically, Strident\u00a0Crisis is a Vs.\u00a0Dave and Bambi fanmod made by joolian and some others. The mod has a total of 79 songs, some meant to be unused, some meant to be used, and\u00a0some used. The 1.0 build, the leaked 1.5 build, and the 1.5 build might take up lots of space just to warn you. The 1.5 builds were so big that they can't fit on this page.<br/></p>\n<p>Click the link for the og gamebanana page</p>\n<p>https://gamebanana.com/mods/362373<br/></p>\n<p>might get to asking for the dave sings happy mod later\u00a0\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>Source code for v1 is also lost :(</p>\n<p>btw the old cob thing was from an android port thing so yeah<br/></p>\n\n<p>credits to the dave and bambi team, fnf team, strident crisis team,\u00a0 and some other people</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T07:32:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9fb/9fbb05d0b11751e6021e74d786971069.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["FNF Archivin'"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
