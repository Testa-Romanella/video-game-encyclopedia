Everyone who has a copy of STRIDE on their Steam account, get STRIDE. net as a separate app to their library. <br/><br/><strong>STRIDE. net </strong>is released as a public alpha with 1 game mode and a few maps available. We do it to collect initial feedback, test our servers and decide how to develop the multiplayer in the future.<h3>What content does the public alpha have?</h3><br/>The first multiplayer mode for STRIDE. net is a variation of the game of tag which is called \"Zombie Horde\". In this mode, players take on the role of zombies or non-infected survivors. Survivors must avoid being touched by infected zombie players, while zombies must infect as many survivors as possible within the allotted time.<br/><br/>The main gameplay focus is on action packed parkour chases and escapes. The players must utilize their VR parkour skills to jump from ledges, dive under obstacles, and slide down cables to avoid infection or take down the remaining survivors.<br/><br/>As with STRIDE, which only had Endless at launch, we'll be introducing more game modes to STRIDE. net as development progresses.<br/><br/>The servers are open now.
