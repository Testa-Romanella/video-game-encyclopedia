Find the next dead pixel to advance through the levels. At each level, your enemies become faster and more aggressive.<br/>If the red pixels encamp over the dead pixel, you may have no choice but to lead them away before circling back.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T10:02:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa5/aa59c8bcd852169a088942e9f742fe56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["DeadPixelGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
