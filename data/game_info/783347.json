Use it to\u00a0relieve your inner stress by popping everything on the screen\u00a0(it's kinda like virtual bubble wrap, actually). What about using it to practice\u00a0your aim? What about competing with your friends to see who is the fastest clicker? What about... yeah you know what I mean.\u00a0The possibilities are endless!<br/><br/><strong>How do you play Satiscliqqer?</strong><br/>It's quite simple. Your goal is to pop all the so-called <em>'cliqs'</em> on the screen. Together with cliqs\u00a0there are <em>'chains'</em>. These are just like cliqs, but in a chain! These can all be popped with a quick swipe. When you pop everything on the screen, new\u00a0cliqs\u00a0and\u00a0chains will appear! You'll also earn 5 gems which can be used\u00a0to buy <em>'cliqqers'</em>. Cliqqers are different items with their own unique popping sound. That's right, you decide how the satisfying pops should sound!</p>\n<p><em>I don't even know why I made this game but please start clicking pls</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:18:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b288d39931821f397a049cb276b45522.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HOWLITE Entertainment"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
