The mining company you work for drilled too deep, and uncovered an alien species hidden beneath the ice. Ready your ship for launch and try to escape this moon before it is overrun.</p>\n<p>The player has one method of defending themselves: the repulsor gun. The gun fires a projectile that knocks the aliens backwards. Use it to knock the enemies into hazards, out airlocks, or just buy yourself time to get to safety. Be careful though - for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the low gravity of Titan, the repulsor gun can send you flying backwards!</p>\n<p>How to Play</p>\n<ul><li>W A S D to move</li><li>LMB to aim and fire</li><li>RMB to interact with the environment</li><li>Hold Space to activate your grav boots while on grav plating</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T08:22:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/88e/88ed42cd10858b19fac20d8da0afab0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["amr-ff"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
