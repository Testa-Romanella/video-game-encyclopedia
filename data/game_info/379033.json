Those days, and those people,\u00a0have long passed. Malevolent forces laid siege to the colony, and now the only things that live there are the combat drones left behind.<br/>You are an autonomous combat android, sent into Vesta with one purpose: destroy all the hostile machines and make Vesta a safe haven again.</p>\n<p><em>Vesta: Absolution</em> offers two approaches to combat. Run and gun in the ranged stance to take down foes from a distance, or go head-on in the melee stance to stagger enemies and lock them in a deadly combo. Switch between stances at will to suit your surroundings!</p>\r\nOur Team\r\n<p><strong>Brian Patterson</strong><br/><strong>Austin Huffman</strong> (\u00a0http://austinhuffman.weebly.com/\u00a0)<br/><strong>Chris Budden</strong> (\u00a0https://cbudden.itch.io/\u00a0)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-04T04:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a73/a73bbb502b75e4a4fba6c2252dfad3b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 274, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brian Patterson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
