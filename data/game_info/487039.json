The main project will include more characters, longer, more fleshed out story, and quite more features on the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Note From the Developer</strong>: Thank you for trying out our \"Visual Novel Project\". The initial plan was to have 2 love interests but due to my teammate being busy and my lack of writing experience, I had to remove one of them, We are planning to add more characters in the future, with a bit more fleshed out story and longer playtime. Either way, I hope you enjoyed the little prototype nonetheless!</p>\n<p><strong> Engine -\u00a0 </strong> Unity Engine</p>\n<p><strong> Art Software -\u00a0 </strong> MediBangPaint Pro</p>\n<strong> \u2042Credits\u2042 </strong>\r\n\r\nProject Lead\r\n<ul>\n<li>Programmer: TheJayDuck</li>\n<li>Character Artist: TheJayDuck</li>\n<li>UI Design: TheJayDuck</li>\n<li>Jam Story: TheJayDuck</li>\n<li>Main Story: Darijus (Still Being Developed)</li>\n<li>Proofreader: Nobbele</li>\n<li>Tester: Nobbele</li>\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAdditional Assets\r\n<ul>\n<li>Musics:  MusMus </li>\n<li>Sound Designer:  Tim Reichert </li>\n<li>Sprites:  bqlqn (Mars Symbol)  ,  Freepik (Heart)  ,  hirschwolf (Left Arrow) </li>\n<li>Backgrounds: Tyrano Builder,  NoranekoGames </li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:34:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/146/146a47e4b12e89b1dc3d1d8f4aa02226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["TheJayDuck"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
