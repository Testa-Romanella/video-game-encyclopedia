This allowed me to learn the ropes in an environment where it didn't matter if I failed.</p>\n<p>I created a load of small throwaway games for the fun of it. Some of these games got lost or deleted, and some were uncovered in the depths of my old harddrive.</p>\n<p>I decided to rescue as many of them as I could to share them with you.</p>\n<p>It's time for Operation Practice Projects.</p>\n<p>The first is game is \"Time Flies\", a game where you play as a frog where time and gravity changes according to the surface you land on. Your goal is to eat all the flies in each area to unlock the next zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flies act as checkpoints in the zone, and you must eat all the flies to complete the level. If you eat a fly, then you also destroy the checkpoint.<br/><br/>Controls are easy, just click and drag to jump. That's it.</p>\n\n<p>This game is a mess, it's laggy, has no menu, and is about as fun as laying an egg.<br/>Regardless, I wanted to share it with you. Hopefully you can squeeze some entertainment out of it. <br/><br/>None of the games released in Operation PP will be updated in any way, I need to devote all my time to my main project. Zapling Bygone.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T07:10:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b6/3b6049c434da52033b42d10cc53cb1e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["9FingerGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
