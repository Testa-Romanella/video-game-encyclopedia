{"id": 693505, "slug": "group-8-fridge-frenzy", "name": "Group 8 Fridge Frenzy", "name_original": "Group 8 Fridge Frenzy", "description": "<p>In the United States, nearly 80 billion pounds of food is discarded and wasted, which amounts to around40% of our entire food supply. Food waste is an enormous problem, especially since hunger and famine are\u00a0prevalent in other parts of the world. This issue dovetails neatly with the growing epidemic of obesity in the U.S.People, mostly children, are eating more processed foods, which last very long on the shelf, and neglecting their\u00a0perishable fruits and vegetables. We want to create a game to educate children and young adults about the cost of\u00a0wasting food and the necessity of utilizing fresh produce and other healthy foods to create healthy, balanced\u00a0meals.\u00a0Our game would center around a refrigerator. There would be several shelves and boxes where food can\u00a0be. To complete a level, the player needs to make 3 balanced meals from the foods in the refrigerator, accruing\u00a0points for the calories/nutrients, within the given time frame. The more levels completed, the higher the player\u2019s\u00a0score. However, there are obstacles that make things more difficult for the player. The fridge must be navigated.\u00a0Perishable food items disappear faster, but since they are healthy, they are worth more points. Processed\u00a0foods stay in the fridge longer, and are subsequently worth fewer nutrient points. Additionally, there would be\u00a0penalties associated with picking extremely unhealthy items, like slower icon movements, meaning the player\u00a0loses time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T08:31:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d7264e31bb9ed4434fa23fbd4666a0a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["estherfarkas"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
