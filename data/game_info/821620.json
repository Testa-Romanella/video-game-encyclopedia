The \"Dice\" mechanic comes from the fact that your weapon and elemental buff are randomly chosen every 10 seconds. During those 10 seconds, you have to use what the \"dice roll\" gives you.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use WASD to move and mouse LEFT CLICK to attack.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T10:01:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b084325fc8a71109383d68af4c14c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MiniMinja"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
