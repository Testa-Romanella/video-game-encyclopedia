You do this by putting a maximum of 5 people into the hell-evator, which transports the sinners to the circle of choice. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:<br/></strong>Not only did we massively mismanage our time and ended up creating a really unpolished game, but we even failed to deliver a game fitting the actual theme of the jam (which was 'Ancient Technology').</p>\n<p>Nevertheless do we hope that you'll have some fun playing it.</p>\n<p>Criticism is highly appreciated!</p>\n<p><em>Developed by<br/>Patrick Tobler - @Padierfind<br/>Peter Jaschkowske - </em><em>@P_Jaschkowske</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46b/46b25212301367ced2277cf0b8e047ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Padierfind"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
