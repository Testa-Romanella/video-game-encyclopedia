The game offers action racing that sometimes resembles the demolition derby in an open-world setting of Paradise City. The game has a remarkable damage system that improves the whole experience and interrupts monotonous moves across the city, which is free-to-explore for the first time in a series. With The Ultimate Box edition, developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so graphics became much better. Changes also affected the gameplay. Now players can race and explore the entire map of the city either by car or by bike that were also added. The racing career begins at the dump, where the driver, controlled by players, gets their first car and two new bikes. Players complete races and fill the \u201cdriving license\u201d scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the \u201clicense\u201d experience.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2009-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-05T08:01:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7cf/7cf38d2d80267c121c6d0d361e9429ce.jpg", "website": "http://www.criteriongames.com/intro.php", "rating": 3.97, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 136, "owned": 3672, "beaten": 461, "toplay": 29, "dropped": 332, "playing": 22}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 649, "suggestions_count": 432, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 654, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Criterion Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": null}
