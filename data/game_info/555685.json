This year's theme was \"ON/OFF.\" \u00a0Graphics for <em>Expedition</em> are\u00a01-bit, using a palette which resembles the 3310 display at 84x48 pixels, and I use an authentic recreation of the 3310's variable-width bitmap font. Controls use a minimum of three buttons, suitable for one-handed play on a real phone. All audio is simple and monophonic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is\u00a0a short narrative experience inspired by point-and-click adventure games and the \"escape the room\" style of flash game that was extremely popular during the era of the Nokia 3310.\u00a0It\u00a0is written in CHIP-8 assembly language, using the Octo development system.</p>\n<p>If you like <em>Expedition</em>, maybe you should try my\u00a0Nokiajam entry from last year,\u00a0Business is Contagious.</p><p>Special thanks to SystemLogoff for testing a pre-release build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T06:32:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b28/b282b359b320ba2256d8459319192027.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Internet Janitor"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
