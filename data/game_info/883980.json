{"id": 883980, "slug": "schism-tantrumtech", "name": "Schism (TantrumTech)", "name_original": "Schism (TantrumTech)", "description": "<p>Schism is a playable short-story which follows the peril of an asteroid miner named Arch.</p>\n<p>After an unknown entity causes an explosion on his ship, he is shot through an unknown kind of rift into a pocket of space with indeterminable properties. Help Arch navigate his way across fields of mysterious crystalline objects which provide power to keep the life support systems running in his Aegisuit. Arch will need to use the Lash, a device intended to recover dropped tools in space, to pull himself between the objects he names 'Krystels.' Each Krystel type affects the suit's batteries differently, and the mindless Stalkers will chase that charge no matter which resonance colour is in effect.<br/></p>\n<p>The journey is spread over six levels with fully narrated dialogue (and banter) between Arch and his ship's surviving crewmate named Skits. The full playthrough is intended to be a short break away from your day,\u00a0 and a\u00a0refreshing experience in a surreal environment.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is being offered as a taste tester for my style of game, and sales will help towards the purchase of a new school laptop for my daughter. I don't like the idea of crowd funding without offering a product when I have the ability to make something, and if not for the need to raise money I would have developed this IP further before release. With that said, please download it freely for appraisal. If it's not something you would usually pay for, I don't expect you to.</p>\n<p>Reviews and recommendations will inform the viability of expanding the Schism universe and its direction. The ending of this game need not necessarily be the end it implies! In any case, I appreciate your time, and your willingness to give a newcomer a chance. This game was extremely challenging but gratifying to create, and it is my privilege to present it to the esteemed gaming community.</p>\n<p>Thank you, and if nothing else I hope you have fun, because if a game isn't fun, it's just more work.</p>\n<p>- Kyle.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:35:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d7/3d753cfe2d6889a288e3da0c84223745.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TantrumTech"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
