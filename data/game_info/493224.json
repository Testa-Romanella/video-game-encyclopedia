{"id": 493224, "slug": "tool-assisted-manlibear", "name": "Tool Assisted (Manlibear)", "name_original": "Tool Assisted (Manlibear)", "description": "<p>Tool Assisted is a game where you don't directly control the character, you script out their actions, like tool assisted speedruns! Still in early development, expect more content soon.</p>\r\nCommands\r\n<ul><li>Jump</li><li>Attack</li><li>Left</li><li>Right</li><li>Up</li><li>Wait</li></ul>\n<p>All commands can be followed up with a number, this is the number of frames that input will be pressed for, eg \"Left 45\" will move you left for 45 frames. A frame number can be ommitted and the input will only be pressed for a single frame. Commands will be executed in order, one command per line.</p>\r\nSequences\r\n<p>Sequences are different to commands, they allow you to create a list of commands that you can easily play at any point, they work like macros. To define a sequence you'd write something like:<br/></p>\r\n\r\nseq ClimbLadder       &lt;-- this is the name of the sequence\r\n:Jump                 &lt;-- these are the actions of the sequence\r\n:Wait 25              &lt;-- each action needs to start with :\r\n\r\n<p>The sequence can then be used simply by writing it's name, with or without a number after, this number will be the number of times the sequence is repeated, like:</p>\r\n\r\nLeft 45\r\nClimbLadder 5\r\nLeft 20\r\n\r\n<p>This can make complex levels that have lots of similar sections much less tedious to write<br/></p>\r\nScript Editor\r\n<p>The script editor is your tool to control who the character moves. Once you've got a script ready to run click Play and it'll show you how the route is working out. White lines are currently running, green lines ran successfully and red lines didn't run (things like trying to jump in midair). At the top of the script editor is a slider to control the speed of the game, this makes debugging long levels less tedious</p>\r\nTips\r\n<ul>\n<li>You can't jump in mid-air, so try adding a 'Wait [number]' command if your jumps aren't registering</li></ul>\r\n\r\nAttributions\r\n\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Art - Pixel Frog (check it out here!)</li>\n<li>Music - Tristan Lohengrin</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T15:44:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e90018ed34824da8515b633bf8e5549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Manlibear"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
