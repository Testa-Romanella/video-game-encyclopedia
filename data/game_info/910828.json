Made for a 3-week solo game jam for a class, with the theme \"You Are The Villain\".<br/><br/>Two wannabe villains, Magpie and Obscurius, are competing to get a promotion from their boss \u2013\u00a0Lady Vestra the Undying. A position on the Lady's dark council has suddenly become vacant, and the\u00a0Lady has decided to choose a replacement by\u00a0trapping two of her favorite troublemakers in what is essentially an arcane escape room, and promoting whichever one makes it out first. The two are rivals and don\u2019t like each other very much, but it doesn't seem like it's possible to get out without working together. Which is weird, because there's only one job opening. . .<br/><br/>Also: stars, spells, terrible puns, and some light\u00a0artistic vandalism.<br/><br/>Coding, Writing, and Art by Anna Arkhipova (Frogwild)<br/>Music provided by Peritune</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-16T13:26:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dd/2dde45378de2518ef284b8c233fafe0e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Frogwild"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
