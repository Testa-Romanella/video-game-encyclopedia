Right.</p><p>Engorge Gorgezilla as much as you can. Destroy all the buildings in your way to find all the succulent people that can keep you alive. Wreck the ever-intensifying opposing forces. You won't go down without a fight. You will damn eat until you damn die, dammit.</p><p>D to take a step (for moving forward, one step at a time)<br/>J for a high chomp (for taking down helicopters)<br/>I for a mid chomp (for busting down buildings and finding the people)<br/>L for a low chomp (for eating people and destroying tanks)<br/>K for a stomp (for smashing things directly below you)<br/>(alternate controls: Space, Up, Right, Down, and Left respectively)</p><p>===</p><p>This is a slightly fatter game than Gorgezilla 1.0 which was made for Ludum Dare 33. Based on some feedback, videos, and cravings, I added more stuff, but not everything yet. Could I say this is both \"published\" and \"unfinished?\" Because I want to say that's what it is. I will finish it someday--whatever \"finish\" means.</p><p>In due time.</p><p>Vague version of stuff I added:<br/>Web/friendly, less hand-straining controls (hopefully)<br/>Stomp ability (totes get more hits on them hardy tanks)<br/>Popo<br/>Soljas<br/>Bullets that punish your ignorance<br/>Slower people (maybe)<br/>Guest score submission<br/>Difficulty tweaks<br/>Performance tweaks<br/>Some graphical tidbits</p><p>Vague version of stuff I wanted to add/fix but didn't get around to:<br/>Power ups<br/>More enemy types<br/>Background graphics<br/>Maybe some real title art wowee<br/>More layers of music<br/>More progressive/varied gameplay<br/>Catalysts of dopamine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f26/f264affdec4790e76449b45a9a446663.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jelinib"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
