The half-gear symbolizes a reclaiming of technology for sustainable projects and infrastructure, and the sunbeams represent the hopefulness and futurism of the solarpunk movement. The solarpunk movement seeks to answer the question \"what does a sustainable society look like\" by taking any and all good and accessible technologies and lifestyles and making them widespread. It is a form of resistance through infrastructure and activism, and it is also a derivative of the broader term \"hopepunk\". Solarpunks refuse to give up to the idea that we are ecologically doomed.\"</p>\n\n<p>This work is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T07:24:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa04b854d7c8186a8ffa331e52c4e034.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Affinity Games Collective"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
