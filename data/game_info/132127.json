It's based on this comic\u00a0https://xkcd.com/789/.</p>\n<p>You play as a tumbleweed in the old west. Your online methods of movement are rolling and using the recoil from your pistols to propell yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if the game will actually work on other people's computers, this is my first time uploading a game. So if it the first download doessn't work, I have uploaded the whole C# project here too if you want to try running the exe in the folder. The application is in\u00a0TumbleWeed\\bin\\Windows\\x86\\Debug.</p>\n<p>Side note: If you do download the source and feel like poking around, be warned. I have no idea what I'm doing so the code is ugly, inefficient, undocumented, and overall awful. Just felt like putting an explanation here.</p>\n<p>I built the game using Monogame.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a1be40dbb14dd5479f8f6b3d287b3cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ClockworkDice"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
