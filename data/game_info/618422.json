You want to get to the yellow square (don't ask why, that's just what you want). You can join together with the red blocks to achieve your goal. WASD or arrows to move, R to reset the level. Other than that, I trust you can figure it out. Sorry for the confusion everyone, the 5th level is just an end screen :S</p>\n<p>First game jam. Didn't have as much time as I wanted, so the game is very lacking in polishing, and mostly just content. Hope the idea is fun though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T10:37:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8acf7e782e98f6a44b3e854e3524868d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zargozza"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
