However, it won\u2019t be easy. Anarchy reigns, and zombies are a plague. They are not very smart, but they are everywhere, and they are legion.<br/><br/>Build your own defensive shelter, and turn it into a fortress. Find lost survivors, like a nurse, a sheriff, or the sniper and convince them to join your faction. Together you will be able to improve the base with rooms full of guns, flamethrowers, machine guns, traps, and grenade launchers.<br/><br/>But the road to survival will be full of dangers. Anarchy, bandits and zombies, reign the post-apocalyptic world. Survival does not only depends on staying away of zombies, it is also important to defend your shelter from bandits, and thieves. Other survivors have built their own shelters, and they see your base as a threat. In the post-apocalypse land, every new shelter is a dangerous enemy.
