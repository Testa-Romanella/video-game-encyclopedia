I plan to continue developing this game further!</strong></p>\n<p>The theme for GMTK Game Jam - 2020 was \"Out of Control\". I expanded on a rough idea of an RPG game that you were not in control of the battles. That gave birth to this game where you are a manager of a party of demons who are racing to be the fastest to beat six unique troops of enemies. If you do achieve this, make sure to comment on your Proof of Completion, and I will try to keep the high score in the description.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>A completely new twist on the RPG genre, by having you act solely as a manager of the party</li><li>Balancing the Health, Energy, and Morale while trying to fight six unique troops</li><li>Full Tutorial in-game</li><li>Manual High Score via the comments</li><li>Classic RPG Maker Menus</li></ul>\n<p>There are some custom songs and sound effects thanks to Forrest Z.
