The down command isn't necessary in the single level I made (it's used to go\u00a0 down climbable surfaces). Escape quits the game.</p>\n\n<p>Goal: reaching the \"GJ!\" text</p>\n\n<p>Momentum:</p>\n<p>When building momentum (by walking\u00a0 \u00a0into a wall or jumping into a\u00a0 ceiling), you may need a bit of time (less than 2s anyway) to get to the maximum speed. Stopping to move or turning around cancels the\u00a0 lateral momentum and hitting the ground doesn't preserve the boosted jump.</p>\n\n<p>Skipping:</p>\n<p>When going fast against an obstacle but being blocked, you can skip\u00a0 the obstacle to a position further on the trajectory you'd have taken if you weren't blocked. This is also what initiates higher momentums.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T02:12:08", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alluysl"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
