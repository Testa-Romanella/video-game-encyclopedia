Seven individuals got together to put their skills together to see if they could develop a\u00a0bad game. It looks like it might have wound up as something!\u00a0</p>\n<p>This practice project came to life thanks to the following people: 'Frittoz', 'Judoo', Anthony Flagg, Cassie, 'Skizzy', and Jaye!</p>\n<p>Many things learned, through frustration, annoyance, and just playing around. It isn't the best game in the world, but it was a thing that we all did! <br/></p>\n<p>This is v1, so more things might come later. There aren't any screen-shots yet, but there are some GIFs taken during the development cycle. Do enjoy this pretty simple game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-28T05:40:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/20d/20d62c05e9c8e7fa691a6acaf9e8b122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["otherworld"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
