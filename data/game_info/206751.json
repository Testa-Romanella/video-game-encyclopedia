The theme was \"It's a Feature, Not a Bug\".</p>\n<p>There was two features in the game. One is invisible walls only the player and the bullets can get stopped by and the other is that you can get stuck in the walls. To get free you must spin circles around the player with your mouse while using arrow keys to move to break free.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Instructions on how to play are in the game. One thing I did forget to list though is you can get hit 3 times before you die. It gets crazy really quick. It will seem like the bullets fire too fast but very quickly it will get challenging.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All resources were from Kenney as per the game jam.</p>\n<p>http://kenney.nl/assets<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d04/d0449f62dc0a230bc9c6ca7e69049d2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bob2k2k"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
