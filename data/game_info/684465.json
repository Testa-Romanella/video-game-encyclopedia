To be chosen is to be cursed. Thine duty shall prevail against all odds.<br/></p>\n<p>As Xolo, the chosen guardian and guide of the Aztec folks, it is thine duty to prepare the gods' offerings to help them travel to the afterlife. But beware, the evil dog Ahuizotl will hunt thee. Run with\u00a0<strong>Shift</strong> and try to escape from within his claws. Ahuizotl is smart and will not rest, so beware, he might trick you into a corner and feast on your light.<br/></p>\n<p>Thine light will guide thee on thine hazardous task, but the disparity rules even after death, so every light shall perish. Extend your internal light with the <strong>Right Mouse Click.</strong> But don't be afraid, the sacred flower \"Cempas\u00fachil\" will light thine path through the void and bring you comfort.</p>\n<p>Time is of the essence to fulfill thine duty, so you shalt search for the lost souls, dragged by the Ahuizotl ages ago. They cannot find light, but will help to bring peace to others. Look for them and grab the offerings with the <strong>Left Mouse Click</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Aztecs will provide four different types of offerings for the altars:</p>\n<ul><li>Cempas\u00fachil flowers</li><li>Jewelry</li><li>Corn</li><li>Decorations made of paper</li></ul>\n<p>Thou shalt search for the soul altars and drop the offerings with <strong>Left Mouse Click</strong>, when you reunite all 4 different types of offerings, that soul will find his way into the afterlife and your job will be one step closer to completion.</p>\n<p>Embark on your path to the void and remember, to be choisen is to be cursed, Thine duty shall prevail against all odds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<ol><li> Carlos Alberto Garc\u00eda de Alba Ch\u00e1vez - Programming, Music, Audio, AI</li><li>\u00a0Daniel Ulises Vel\u00e1zquez Ponce - Digital Art, Animation, Game Design</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-25T08:55:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41e/41eae868fd25321d0ff8efcc4aae6149.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eldritch Games MX", "DaniconD"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
