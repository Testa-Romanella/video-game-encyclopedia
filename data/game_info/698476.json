And of course, our precious &amp; poggers frontline workers who dedicate themselves in this time of need.</p><p><strong>Questions</strong><br/></p><p><em>What were you inspired by?</em></p><p>When we heard the theme of this year's game jam, it was natural that frontline workers came to mind incredibly quickly. However, we all agreed that it was a bit too mainstream, so our team decided to change our game to not play as the frontline workers themselves, but to manage them in their hectic workplace instead!</p><p><em>What sort of experience/message are you hoping your game will bring across to the player?</em></p><p>Through Medical Mayhem, our team hopes that out game can show how crazy and tough it can be as a frontline worker in these tough times. We hope that this will enable players to empathize with them and feel what it would be like, but with also a fun and interesting twist for them to enjoy.</p><p><em>Why did you end up choosing this direction for your game?</em></p><p>Frontline workers have been always portrayed on media and we have always wanted to empathize with them giving other people a chance to experience what it would be like to manage such stressful and sticky situations.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T07:45:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56e/56eb4fe91daf6c07ebc33137a59f509b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["fourfingers"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
