Probably could have had the gameplay a little more fleshed out, but got hung up on level design for a few days of the jam.\u00a0<br/><br/>Some known issues: <br/>Near the starting point customers seem to disappear.\u00a0<br/>AI can be wonky, sometimes causing customers to just stand next to the truck. Move on to other customers and it should clear up the issue.\u00a0<br/>Car sounds seem to be very low in the build.<br/><br/><br/>Controls:<br/>Keyboard:<br/>W-A-S-D to drive/brake/steer<br/>Space for handbrake<br/>C to change camera<br/>Escape for menu<br/><br/>Xbox controller:<br/>Left stick to steer<br/>Right trigger to accelerate\u00a0<br/>Left trigger to brake<br/>B for Handbrake<br/>Back for change camera<br/>Start for menu<br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of the assets used:<br/>Synty Studios 3D Model\u00a0 Packs<br/>Ice Cream Stacked<br/>NWH Vehicle Physics 2<br/>Polyverse Skies<br/>Epic Toon FX<br/>MK Toon<br/>Advanced Dissolve<br/></p>\n<p>Music:<br/>Signs of Summer - Ty Simon<br/>Patio Lanterns - Alternative Version - Rex Banner<br/>Lovely Day - Rex Banner<br/>Homemade Apple Pie - Jamie Bathgate<br/>Playground - Young Rich Pixies<br/>Easy Breezy - Rhythm Scott<br/>Baby Steps - Rhythm Scott<br/>Primary Colors - Rex Banner<br/>Sunset Beach Song - Jim Gaven<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:48:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f039431c9a8369b910ebe2bc78765024.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Micreps"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
