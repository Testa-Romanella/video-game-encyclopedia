I want this to be as realistic to the real life game as possible and as such you go against another car toward each other. You play as a car that you can drive on this road where you made a bet with someone else that they will chicken out before you, driving at one another. When the other person chickens out so to speak they turn away from you, in order to not hit you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T02:20:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bd6/bd6f5f8350384f277b8402d86196c1ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naschwin", "Daniel Matlock"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Daniel Matlock"], "esrb_rating": null}
