There were very few people, most were researchers as the illustrious Professor Oak studying pok\u00e9mon of the island. However, three years ago it has proven the existence of Mew Pok\u00e9mon on the island. As this was a very rare Pok\u00e9mon, it drew a crowd with many coaches seeking Mew, then the island was filled with coaches. Many of them were quite skilled and famous, then others went to this island challenge, then the island has become a great meeting point battles which led to creation of many tournaments which also brought many viewers. Many things happened in the last three years, a great battle site was created: The Coliseum and the coaches were classified as matured there. Those who made many tournaments had a high rank and with that earned several types of exclusive treatment as best items, pok\u00e9mon, locations, services, etc ... Many new Pok\u00e9mon have been discovered on the island, others were released by coaches, and even some went to stores. Most were discovered by explorers living in places never visited before. Some places have been created to increase the diversity of pok\u00e9mon growing increasingly. And that's the story of this place, the Pok\u00e9mon Island.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a44/a442ef95bd01f2744eac5807c554c906.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martim Freitas"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
