You have been tasked with taking your precious cargo through the notorious Cyan Zone. Navigate your pod using the \u201cZ\u201d and \u201c.\u201d keys to move right and left. Watch out for the deadly zone barriers that seem to randomly obstruct your path. As you progress, more cargo is added to your pod, making it even more difficult. Try and get as far as you can without hitting any of the barriers. Your score will increase for each zone barrier you avoid and you will get a bonus added to your score for every level you complete. Once you complete a level you will see the \u2018New Level!\u201d marker appear. You can fly through this message if necessary as it will not affect your AstroPod. The game ends when you hit one of the barriers. Simply type \u2018RUN\u2019 and press return to start a new game.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T10:55:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7cd/7cdc9a5fc68af34fc730a71a23084f32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BASIC 10Liner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
