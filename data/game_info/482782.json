Secondly, I've started a YouTube channel called \"Let's Talk Game Design\", and doing a deep analysis of Running Red helped to outline and illustrate some of what I\u00a0consider the 'fundamentals' of game design theory.</p>\n<p>If you want to watch the video that this game features in, you can find it below.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, just an autorunner.
