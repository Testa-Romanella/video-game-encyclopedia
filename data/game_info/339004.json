Only one character is \"active\"\u00a0at a time and only the active one interacts with the world. Get to the top and try to get as high score as possible.</p>\n<p>Took me 1 hr of finalizing the base game, 0.5hr for polishing animations, 1hr of adding transferable data and a new level.</p>\n<p>Made with Unity.</p><p>Goal of the game is to reach to the top with the same characters sharing platform space on a goal-marked platform (green).</p><p>The non-active character can pass through objects.<br/></p><p>Landing on a platform awards points towards your score. Landing on the same platform with both characters and the second hit awards the platform points * 1.5. So clearing a level by jumping on all platforms with both characters\u00a0awards you maximum amount of points.</p><p>Landing on a goal platform takes you to the next level in 5 seconds\u00a0</p><p>Falling outside and forcing you to reset will reset the points. So if you reset on level 2, you will lose all your points from the previous level(s).</p><p>Side-way motion is \"impulse\"\u00a0rather than continous or static arc. So you can add a lot of force in horizontal movement by spamming a button, so be careful.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T05:16:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a69/a691ef7bd3f2c49a5cfe20e4596f99d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mrbalrog"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
