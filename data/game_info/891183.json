Shoot to light up the scene and take in your surroundings.\u00a0 You will have to maneuver, jump, and climb\u00a0the dilapidated halls, solve puzzles, and... a few other surprises.\u00a0 Complete each room by reaching the green door. Your bullets refresh every level.</p>\n\r\nCONTROLS\r\n\n<ul><li>MOVE: Left\u00a0Stick or WASD</li><li>LOOK:\u00a0Right Stick or Mouse</li><li>JUMP: South Button or Space\u00a0Bar</li><li>INTERACT: West Button or E Key</li><li>SHOOT:\u00a0Right Trigger or Left Click</li><li>AIM:\u00a0Left Trigger or Right Click</li><li>PAUSE:\u00a0Start or Enter</li></ul>\r\n**NOTE** The default setting for look sensitivity on mouse and keyboard is too high for a lot of players.
