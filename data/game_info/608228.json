You should stop the mad devourer before he eats everything. The game will keep track of your \"low score\", that is the time when you allowed pac-man to score the least.</p>\n<p>This game is a submission to the Godot Wild Jam #33. The theme of the jam is \"You Aren't the Hero\" (although, in my heart, Blinky is always the hero!).</p>\n<p>You can play either with a keyboard or with a controller. Unfortunately there's no input remapping options (ran out of time!).</p>\n<p>Mac version is completely untested. Windows version is tested under Wine.</p>\r\n\r\nLicenses\r\n<ul>\n<li>This game uses the Godot Game Engine.\r\n\n<p>\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
