I'm working on new games aswell, this is basically a test game, thanks for playing! you can also download it! and play it on your desktop or laptop. it also has built in start keys, so you can replay the game without having to shut it down. I'm a noob on knowing which files go to which, but I know you can most certainly play this on windows! so your good to go.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-12T05:25:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/303/3036f37df78568d0a08b196c29f09c78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Adin really likes Oranges!"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
