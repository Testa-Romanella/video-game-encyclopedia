Like Rockman 7 Famicom before, it is a recreation of the normal game, except sprites and backgrounds are converted to the normal 8-bit format, so it is like the past Mega Man games. Due to this, there are no FMVs.</p>\n<p>There are also some more similarities to Rockman 7 Famicom. There is no &quot;save progress&quot; system and is replaced with the common &quot;blue and red dot&quot; password system (passwords keep track of obtained items and screws as well, so there are much more filled spaces than empty spaces). The shop is also featured, and screws are found throughout the game. Unlike the normal Mega Man 8 and in similar way to Mega Man and Bass, screws are more mass-produced, and there is no need to decide carefully between the items. Also, E-Tanks are available again and can be bought in the shop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-05T03:40:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21bed9fec4043d2e330bd69ee2a82cf0.jpg", "website": "http://demake.web.fc2.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 224, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
