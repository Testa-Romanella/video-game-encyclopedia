{"id": 522701, "slug": "indigo-project-366-development-alpha", "name": "Indigo Project 366 Development Alpha", "name_original": "Indigo Project 366 Development Alpha", "description": "<p>Currently, there is only a boss fight, but with your abilities, and your Ai controlled team, you have what it takes to win it!</p>\n<p>To start, once in the game you may press Q at any time to view each of the keys that will initiate abilities of yours. The way abilities function in this game is: when pressed, you will spawn the spell-maze that must be completed in order to cast the spell. Once the maze is spawned, click the green area of the maze and drag the magical ball of energy to the end of the maze (you do not need to hold down the click in order to drag). Be sure to stay inside the lines, or the spell will fizzle and be cancelled. Once the magical ball reaches the marker at the end of the maze, the spell will be completed and something special will happen!</p>\n<p>To win you must kill the boss! While doing so, the boss will fight back, and if you or any of your party members falls to zero HP, then you will all lose! You must balance both dealing good damage, and keeping the team alive in order to make it through. Your party member's HP is each directly above their portraits, and your HP is the blue bar at the bottom, be mindful!</p>\n\n<p>===Spell List===</p>\n<p>S - A simple slash, once completed this will deal heavy damage to the boss. This spell also ends with your cursor directly over D-slash's starting position.</p>\n<p>D - A simple backslash, to be used with S-slash. This slash also deals heavy damage to the boss upon completing, and ends with your cursor directly over S-slash's starting position.</p>\n<p>F - Upon completion, fire ignites within your eyes and you become enraged, dealing bonus damage with each of your other damaging abilities as long as the fire lasts.</p>\n<p>G - Upon completion, magical dark tentacles lash out at the boss, dealing small damage at first. For each time you perform and complete this spell, it deals more and more damage surpassing even S-slash eventually.</p>\n<p>H - A simple heal, to be used on allies and yourself. Remember, if you or another team-member falls to zero HP, you all will lose. To prevent this, perform and complete this spell, then click on an ally to heal them for a moderate amount. Once you have chosen an ally to heal, you will need to recast, and complete this spell in order to heal again. You can heal yourself by performing and completing this spell's maze, then clicking on the heart in the center of the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>===End of Spell List===</p>\n<p>This game is only the offline development-alpha version for experimentation, and public trial! The full game will replace the ally team-members with your real life friends, who will be fighting alongside you to defeat bosses!
