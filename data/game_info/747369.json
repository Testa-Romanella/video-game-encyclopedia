Opening in a new location each and every day, it\u2019s surprising nothing\u2019s falling apart. Actually, that\u2019s your job! Rides are breaking and it\u2019s your duty to fix them before someone gets hurt (and more importantly they get a lawsuit on their hands)! It\u2019s also company policy that you must do so while riding a unicycle. Repairing things won\u2019t be so easy, as competitor carnivals will try to stop you and shut down the carnival, running you out of your newly acquired job.</p>\n<p>You play as Handy Harold Henderson, the new handyman at Peter Avion\u2019s Yesteryear Universally Shifting (P.A.Y. U.S.) Carnival. Equipped with a unicycle, it\u2019s your job to ride around the carnival, dodge obstacles, and fix the attractions before they break.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T11:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c5/5c57f81af03b050625a87be77e2e08ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 180, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cyber Chroma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
