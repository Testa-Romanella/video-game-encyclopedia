This one is a year old and I decided to spend last 2 days making it releasable. Otherwise it'd rot on my hard drive forever.\u00a0It's still missing of of the most important features of action rogue-likes: multitude of characters/enemies/weapons/items, but I guess it's better to have it released like that than not at all, even if it's only fun for 5 minutes : )</p>\n<p>So... Fight more then one (!)\u00a0kind of monster with your trusty sword and no plot what-so-ever, collect treasure of coins with no way to spend them and remember - I had more fun writing\u00a0the game than you have playing it!</p>\n<p>Hope you like it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T05:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c4/8c48260e65d9bbe411027835c6b9c298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["0x72"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
