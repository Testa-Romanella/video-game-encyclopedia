Original submission\u00a0build available in downloads.</p>\n<p>- Modified the asteroids so they're easier to click.</p>\n<p>- Modified starting positions for asteroids and blackholes.</p>\n\n<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>Rotatheron is a simple, asteroids, billiards-y kind of game made for Kenney Jam 2021. The rules are simple: drive the asteroids into the blackhole as quick as you can.</p>\n<p>Asteroids will vary in size, speed and rotation as the levels progress. Screen edges can reset an asteroid's location, as well as speed and rotation. Watch out for the whiteholes which act as goal keepers of sorts, and cause the same mischief as the screen edges.</p>\n<p>Give it a go, and let me know what you think! Thanks!</p>\n<p>-Manbo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T15:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f38/f3831e5dd6a7d0fc201ec8701edd0c47.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Manbo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
