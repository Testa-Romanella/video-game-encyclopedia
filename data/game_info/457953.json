Build a unique deck for every playthrough, and defeat powerful enemies.<br/><br/>Four game modes are available for players to enjoy:<br/><br/>[Story Mode] - Here you can experience the world, following the  main character on a bizarre journey, fighting to unravel the hidden truths of this world.<br/>[Abyssal Mode] - In this game mode, you can fight your way through randomly generated levels and monster encounters. Select from multiple difficulties for a true challenge.<br/>[Weekly Challenges] - Every Monday the format changes, providing a unique challenge for players to overcome. Earn points for successful completions. At the end of the week, the players with the highest scores will be awarded prizes.<br/>[Tower of Souls] - A pure PvP playground. You won\u2019t have access to your talent tree or any outside buffs, just you and a deck devised to defeat the competition. Challenge yourself and improve.<br/><br/>If you enjoy challenging roguelike deck builders, and you\u2019re tired of RPGs that call themselves \u201ccard games\u201d, then we hope you enjoy Journey of Abyss.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T02:39:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abe/abe115c98038c9a261f6423e9d9610a4_c3rCWQy.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 319, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Ohayoo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Card"], "publishers": ["Beijing Bit Walking Technology Co"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
