{"id": 865050, "slug": "fortunes-run", "name": "Fortune's Run", "name_original": "Fortune's Run", "description": "<p>Explore a decaying industrial world left behind in humanity&#39;s never-ending race to conquer the stars. Beneath its iron skies, desperate souls kill and steal for passage to the still-plentiful frontier worlds. Sink or swim in this high-octane first-person shooter with stealth and RPG elements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Discover the quiet dystopia of Fortune&#39;s Run, where food is free yet people starve and every living soul on New Zabra is bought and paid for by off-world interests. A classic FPS with undertones of role-playing in the spirit of Deus Ex and EYE: Divine Cybermancy, featuring the campy tone of space operas and titles like Metal Gear Solid.</p>\n<h1>FEATURES</h1>\n<h2>The World</h2>\n<p>Discover a rich science-fiction setting full of strange aliens, twisted conspiracies and gritty character drama. From the perspective of Mozah Lydd&#39;sekh, washed-up ex-con extraordinaire, you will get to explore stunning hand-crafted levels packed tight with narrative and dialogue. New Zabra is an environment of constant violence, drug abuse and sexual exploitation. For most, there is no hope of redemption, but Mozah still dreams. Will you be able to navigate the wheels of karma without becoming just like those who wronged you?</p>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\n<p>The combat is fast-paced, complex and will require you to slow time with Focus\u2122 to escape death and execute your foes with style. In addition to a standard FPS arsenal of rifles, shotguns and rocket launchers, Mozah can deflect incoming projectiles with melee attacks, stun enemies with special combos and perform kicks, grabs, holds, chokes and throws. Fighting games and character action titles have been a huge inspiration, contributing to a dynamic, highly technical feel.</p>\n<h2>Stealth</h2>\n<p>Experience a novel take on stealth gameplay, where speed is rewarded and acrobatic movement is the best way to navigate past patrols and cameras. No more creeping around! To Mozah, moving slowly is just the best way to get caught.</p>\n<h2>Movement</h2>\n<p>Circle jumps. Strafe jumps. Air-control. Fortune&#39;s Run uses a custom physics model based on the Quake 3 player movement. This ensures accurate implementation of hardcore first-person shooter mechanics. In addition to the classic set of moves popularized by Quake and Half-Life, you will have at your disposal physics-driven parkour mechanics: for example, wall friction can be used to reduce gravity to simulate wall-running. No context sensitive actions, only physics!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-20T07:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da35e296a81aa6a8d3f243492a56a47.jpg", "website": "https://www.fortunes.run/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 3, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 506, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team Fortune"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Team Fortune"], "esrb_rating": null}
