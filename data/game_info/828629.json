Although the official first release is 1.0 it is still in development! As for Content, that's supposed to be a surprise but, I will tell you anyways!</p>\r\nPortals!\r\n<p>This was probably the feature that was the most fun to make! Who doesn't like Portals! You spawn them using a Portal Synthesizer Item! Then wait for the portal to stop moving, this will indicate that the portal is usable! Once this occurs, if any NPC or the Player collides with it, they will be teleported to the nearest AI Wander Point (or any point that NPCs can wander to! That's all there is to it! The Color of the portal is also random!</p>\r\nMacOS and Linux Support!\r\n<p>Now macOS and Linux Users and either enjoy or suffer from my mod! The Linux version was tested using the Windows Subsystem for Linux\u00a0on Windows 11 Home (My Laptops OS, yes, I use a Laptop to do everything, I do not own a Desktop). The test showed that the Linux Edition should be able to run on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS or Later, Other Linux Distrubutions and all Ubuntu Versions BELOW 20.04.4 have not been tested!</p>\r\nAnd More\r\n<p>with more to come as well!</p>\n<p>Note: No screenshots will be added to this page to allow for people to experience the mod for themselves, Youtube Videos about this mod ARE allowed, and credits can be found in the mod's in-game credits screen!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f41/f411055b4059b0630fb18ce3c9cab4b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["BALDI"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
