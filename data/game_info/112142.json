Song of Arashi is an action-puzzler about ninja-powers, wit, and grappling hooks.</p><p>Like any platformer, you must use your skills of dexterity with A, D, and Spacebar to move left, right, and jump (respectively) but to save your village you must do more. \u00a0With the scroll wheel you can select from different ninja tools you acquire along the way - use the grappling hook to reach high places or the bomb to carve out a new path. \u00a0While the main actions of these tools are executed with the left mouse button, the right mouse button often reveals a secondary power - the bo staff can be used to deflect projectiles, the shuriken can be teleported to while in sage mode. \u00a0What's sage mode you ask? \u00a0Just press 'E' and you can use your ninja power (shown by the blue chi-ribbon on your head). \u00a0Good luck on your quest!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e6/4e6f6ed32f70ce7850dbd5e4ad760e54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BomberDev"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
