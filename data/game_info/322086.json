The pressure is on, can you wake up?<br/></p>\n<p>This game started as a concept demo for my game design class in college. My professor encouraged me to continue to improve my game with what she saw, especially considering my enthusiasm in the project. There are and will be bugs in the game, but please do not be afraid to reach out to me in efforts to help me remedy them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you enjoy the game, please consider donating to aid in me improving the projects as well as future releases. This was made entirely with free assets from various sources that I will gather in the near future. I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you all so much for reading, I hope you enjoy Hallowed Ground!</p>\n\n<p>05/22: I just want to thank everyone who has tried out the game thus far! There are some dramatic improvements that are coming!
