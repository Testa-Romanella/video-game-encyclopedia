It is a relatively simple puzzle-platformer taking place in space as astronauts; however, when you reach your end goal, a clock, you become evil and turn back time. Once you are evil, in order to pass the level, you have to make your previous self die. You can use different mechanics such as lasers, moveable blocks, and doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Move with w and s or arrows</p>\n<p>Jump with space bar</p>\n<p>Restart level with r</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-05T12:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27ce894cfc9ae507e593e8c77d45add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AppleFruitGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
