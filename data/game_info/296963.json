The Jam requires participants to make a game in 48 hours based upon a certain theme along with optional restrictions. The theme for the jam was \"What do we do now?\" The idea behind the game was using a voting system to determine what is done, in this case to decide how a pet is taken care of. The game is essentially Twitch raises a Tamagotchi, inspired by Twitch plays Pokemon.</p>\n<p>Our team for this game was Matthew Dodds, Mallory Brownfield and myself. Matthew handled the network and multiplayer, Mallory handled the art and sound effects and I programmed the game's menus and systems.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76b/76b4a082170359ac7745e7dc93f6b2ca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 107, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanSPeterson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
