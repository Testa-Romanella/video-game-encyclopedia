It is a 2D Platformer game that focuses on reaching the goal. The game has 10 levels and has a good side task of collecting apples. Each level has 3 apples that you can collect and it will be stored in the menu, somewhat like an achievement. The theme of the level changes every 3 levels so there is quite a lot of variety. Last few levels may be \"a bit\"\u00a0 hard.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0The game uses assets from Unity Asset Store such as Pixel frog and Cainos. The music in the game is entirely made by the developer, Michael Chen AKA SerpentSea.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T09:01:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1cb3f9bc0bcc59e14639531936b8096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SerpentSea"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
