In fact I derived quite a bit of pleasure from basking in the ridiculous luxury of the language \u2013 and that's the sort of thing erotica's all about right? In fact, the writing is so lyrical that it's almost poetry\u2026 and I think I'm cool with an interactive sexy poem.</em></p>- Ben Meredith, Indie Haven<p>A Twine experience created in 7 hours for Ludum Dare 30: Connected Worlds</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/221/2219edb194c0e1b778aefcb97525e18d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Newmark Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
