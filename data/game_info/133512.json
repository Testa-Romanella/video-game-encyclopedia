Race to collect orbs whilst battling enemies, using power ups and playing against your friends.</strong></p><p>Fans of X-Orbtek will be familiar with the need for agility to dodge and weave your way through swarms of enemies but now you'll have incoming bullet fire from enemies. It isn't all bad though as you'll have weapons of your own. Place mines, explode bombs or shoot back to take out enemies. With an all new control system you'll be in an action packed battle centred around collecting the orbs.</p><p>X-Orbtek II supports up to four players at once by plugging in X-Box controllers (or similarly compatible). There are three game modes; Main, Classic and Survival. You can even customise the gameplay styles, music and background with extra songs and backgrounds to unlock!</p><p>A portion of total sales will go to charity (Sick Kids Friends Foundation) so if you buy this game you're also helping children.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6bb/6bbea235d6bdc50a2c3465f4f67d8cd1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Oxygen Addict"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
