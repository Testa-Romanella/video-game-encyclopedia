In this free playable RDA episode (sequel) - you are stuck on the one of the Entity bases in the outer space and need to discover what is going on, as with the most of the RDA playable sequels. This episode has unlimited game play, you can stay, explore and fight in some areas for\u00a0 indefinite time, or restart the map each time by going close to and touching the hidden flying disk at the bottom part of the caves. The player protective haz-mat suit can protect you from some damages, but not for too long, so every caution is advised, as to what Hidden Entity creations you may run into, trying to discover about more of their constantly ongoing experimental programs, and they have setup around in order to stop you. As always in RDA - occasional help and tips from Taxon Industries can be found around the map, and the clues that Taxon (presidential candidate fighting the infection and Entity in the RDA zones)  have left for you while roaming around earlier, to leave you with enough helpful clues and support. The gameplay can be paused but not saved and game will restart each time after losing a player life. This free sequel is a very small window into the huge world of RDA. The RDA game serial has about 200+ playable episodes, which we hope to offer via Itch.io first, and further, as more becomes available in the future as well. No any camera effects are used and only camera used in RDA - is proudly - the original Unity 3D camera.<br/></p>\n<p>Since RDA\u00a0framework is\u00a0too\u00a0large\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0ever\u00a0published\u00a0as a\u00a0single\u00a0game\u00a0 - it has been decided that - various playable\u00a0episodes in many\u00a0game\u00a0styles\u00a0are published\u00a0separately instead from it,\u00a0some\u00a0for\u00a0free,\u00a0some\u00a0for donation,\u00a0some paid,\u00a0or\u00a0in-between, and all\u00a0for the gamers and collectionaries pleasure.

RDA sequels (episodes) are also playable via keyboard-mouse, but RDA is not originally designed for that kind of game play, and primarily (to say it again): for the game pads, such as the XBox game pads or similar ones. RDA serial has it's inspiration in the early Valve serial of games, today well known as the HalfLife, OrangeBox for XBox, and especially HalfLife2 original games style, and in similar shooter-adventure epic game titles of the same quality and approx of the same games period. We hope that any playable episodes of RDA you can come across will truly fulfill your gaming afternoon or evening on a rainy day.
