Your goal is now to escape this prison ship with the only weapons you still have : your trusty laser pistol and your wit. Along the way you'll encounter robotic guardians, they will shoot you on sight and supply crates containing health pack, grenade or nothing. At the opposite side of the deck you were prisoner on there is a big rusty elevator. You're on deck 1 and the escape is at the end of deck 5. Good luck.</p>\n<p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>\n<p>You've got 3 actions per turn. You can MOVE on tile, SEARCH a crate or SHOOT an enemy. Each move reduce your accuracy which is reset at the beginning of each turn (top right). Each time you're hit you lose 1 point of life (top left), at zero you die. Enemies will follow you and shoot at you, you can fight back but your laser pistol has only a range of 5 tiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Commands</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Left click to move</li>\n<li>Right click to search a crate or to fire at an enemy.</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T04:05:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9db/9dbb3106df1ff4469514c86104b1e036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Emurga", "Graham Weldon"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
