Dodge attacks from enemies while dishing out damage to prove your worth. Upgrade your possible total damage and\u00a0weaponry through the sacrifice of your health to become the best like no one ever was.</p>\n\n<p>Controls: Arrow keys/Space to move. A to punch. S to swing the laser sword. D to fire lasers.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Want ultimate control and extreme power? Well then you've come to the right place. I've decided to keep hotkeys in the build (yes, intentionally.. don't you worry) so players can experience end game without the glory of progressing to it! These shortcuts only work in the main menu.\u00a0Hard reset: J, K, and either backspace or delete. Unlock every upgrade and gain a ton of health: J and insert.</p>\n\n<p>This is my submission for Ludum Dare 44!</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/neon-caverns</p>\n\n<p><em>Overall I'm happy with it, but I wish I had more time since it fell in the middle of finals week (it was split between 2 weeks).</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ec/0ec9197295531b376531ac62214c9689.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Johan V"], "genres": ["RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
