Will you be the one to slay it?<br/><br/>In this \"slot-builder\" game, you spin the slot wheels and choose a row.<br/><br/>You can then use the icons on the row in whatever order you please. Coins can be picked up and used with a merchant to buy new spaces on your wheels. The merchant will sell you bigger and better coin choices, wizards that can destroy slot wheel spaces (but not the dragon!), furnaces and metal for forging swords, and even completed swords.<br/><br/>But watch out! When you select a row with a dragon icon, it will breathe fire on you, and you will lose health. Run out of health, and it's game over! Use your swords to destroy all the dragon icons on all wheels to win the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/423/4235634c75ebdaed69985b86d1da70d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lone Spelunker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
