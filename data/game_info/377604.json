Try the following:</p>\r\n\r\nfunction tick(self)\r\n  self:forward()\r\nend\r\n<p>And click SAVE. Your unit will drive forward and drill through dirt.</p>\n<p>Maybe try this:</p>\r\n\r\nfunction tick(self)\r\n  local random = math.random(1, 8)\r\n  if random == 1 then\r\n    self:rotateCW()\r\n  elseif random == 2 then\r\n    self:rotateCCW()\r\n  else\r\n    self:forward()\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n<p>You'll get a stupid robot that moves around randomly! (CW = Clockwise, CCW = Counter-clockwise).</p><p>\n</p><p><em>Note: If your unit seems to have\u00a0disappeared into the void, it probably wrapped around and you'll find it at the other end of the map. (The map will loop around automatically in future versions.)</em></p>\n<p>You can also run a script on your factory! Try this\u00a0to build new units automatically when you have enough crystals:</p>\r\n\r\nfunction tick(self)\r\n  self:build()\r\nend\r\n\r\n<p>Try to collect crystals with a robot\u00a0and bring it back to your factory's door, then you can build more robots. Try to\u00a0meet with other players?!<br/></p>\r\nPlanned for later versions\r\n<ul><li>Sensor functions so your units can\u00a0make interesting decisions based on what's around them!</li><li>Enemies, health\u00a0and fighting!</li><li>A proper goal!</li><li>A bigger, more interesting map!</li><li>The ability to run your own server! etc.</li></ul>\n<p>For now, this is just a 3 days experiment.\u00a0\u00a0I spent 20 hours working on this first release.\u00a0 See my Twitter thread about it,\u00a0check out my Twitch stream, and let me know what you think :) Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-27T06:15:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe8/fe8533939c2238cad4a6b639916b118c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sparklin Labs"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
