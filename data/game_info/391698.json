Initially weak, you work by sowing dissent in a complex political environment, taking over a low-ranking noble and working your way up. Play factions against each other, and support dissidents to provoke civil wars, all the while building up your forces.</p>\n<p>An Open-Source sequel to a previous game, with a new focus on playability and coherent, polished gameplay. Repository available at: https://github.com/FallenOakGames/ShadowsBehindTheThrone2</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This game is under development, and this current build is the very first, still lacking a variety of features before it can be considered \"Version 1.0\". Early release in order to get feedback, should anyone have any.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Overview<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The world simulates a set of nobles, all with their own aims and interests. They existing in societies, and vote to achieve their ends. By proposing votes, and voting strategically, you can manipulate them into failing to respond to the true threat, your slowly-developing hidden forces.</p>\n<p>Set silversmiths against wine-makers, while subverting coastal villages to build an army of Deep One fish-people, waiting to storm the surface. Rally your kingdom against another, while supporting dissident nobles in the other in order to provoke civil war, weakening them such that they make easy prey. Grow horrific fields of fleshy limbs and gnashing teeth to terrify the nobles into failing to realise that your enthralled noble is slowly converting them from within into dark cultists.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Development by</strong></p>\n<p>Alexander Wild, Wyatt Lindquist, Tasneem Solie</p>\n<p>Main screen art by Derek Restivo</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mouse + Keyboard.</p>\n<p>Mouse handles camera panning, selecting (left to move/inspect, right to select), menu button clicking.</p>\n<p>Keyboard camera panning through WASD or arrow keys, map-view lenses bound to number keys<br/></p>\n<p>Mouse wheel or z/x keys for map zoom</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum specs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Minor. </p>\n<p>2D graphics and turn based nature require little in the way of CPU or GPU power.
