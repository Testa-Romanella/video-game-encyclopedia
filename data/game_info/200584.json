Cats will move away from you when you shoo them. You can also pick up cats and throw them. Excessive application of cat-herding skills may stress out the poor little cats and make them panic. Panicking cats are hard to manage and spread panic to nearby cats. Time is limited, so hurry up before the game dumps a ton of dogs everywhere to scare away the kitty cats.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/115/115e3c31a15cdb114a87a24e50c04f30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slyonics"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
