It is a very advanced enhancement of the BlitzSonic engine, pushing it to the limits.</p>\n<p>The game is also very customizable to make everything from the ui, characters or stages to your fitting.</p>\n<p>One of the game\u2019s focuses is characters. We have tried our best to bring uniqueness and fun with a crazy amount of 40+ playable characters. They are all individual with a certain set of shared moves.</p>\n<p>The game is looking to mix the best of Sonic games altogether along with new ideas.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the engine and its tons of content!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-25T16:00:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ca/1ca65696d56a3c21b37858d1490c9e7f.jpg", "website": "https://sonicworldfangame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
