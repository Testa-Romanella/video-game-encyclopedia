Think you can escape this little dungeon? Do you have the where-with-all to navigate these foggy halls, and solve the puzzles in your way? Come on in then, <em>MAGE</em>! Let's see what you've got!</p>\n<p>Magelusion is a small platforming puzzle game developed for the LowRezJam 2020 in the span of two weeks using the Godot Engine. It is designed for a resolution of 64x64 pixels... soooo... you might want to expand the window a little!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS<br/>The game uses WASD for major movements. Space to Jump. CTRL to fire/cast spells. The game also, technically, supports controllers. I've only tested this on Linux with an XBox 1 controller. Your mileage may vary!<br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in my Devlog for Magelusion, it can be found here!<br/></p>\n<p>I'd love to hear any and all comments and criticisms for the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:10:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ef/4efc2313a858c75b824c0fda0147dcca.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
