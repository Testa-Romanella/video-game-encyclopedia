In the spirit of the rules of the jam, both genres are very much incorporated together, and what you do during your real-time or stop-time\u00a0interaction\u00a0affects your route selection. A lot of features and content was cut to make it for the submission, and\u00a0the platforming is quite terrible for now.\u00a0Currently, there are only two girls and only two routes; they are rather short with prompt endings, but this is all I can fit and it should satisfy the genre as there is one romantic option. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>This game is keyboard-and-mouse-based. Controller is known to have bugs and may not work. You can\u00a0try downloading the Windows executable but don't resize the window.</p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> In the current version, it does not cost\u00a0Temptation to use the Manipulator. There was simply no time to implement it.\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong>\u00a0- Movement<br/><strong>Shift (Hold)</strong> - Run<br/><strong>Space (Hold) </strong>- Jump<br/><strong>F </strong>- Interact or Next Dialogue<br/><strong>Down/S + F </strong>- Drop from Thin Platform<br/><strong>C </strong>- Toggle Dialogue Mode<br/><strong>Number Keys</strong> - Quick Select Dialogue Choice<br/><strong>Mouse Move + Left Mouse Button</strong>\u00a0- Manipulator (Telekinesis)<br/><strong>Q </strong>- Hide Manipulator<br/><strong>~</strong>\u00a0- Options Menu (For Adjusting Volume)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:43:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/794/794a6cfd0852330ae0b8ae519d8f3184.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["railkill"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
