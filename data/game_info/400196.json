You have any friends? Say no more this is the game for you!!! 2 PLAYER local co-op - get your friend on your side fighting cute little slimes and build the pipe! BUILD defenses, barricades and pipes. GATHER resources for building. GIVE(the theme is \"giving\") and trade between each other to accomplish the objective!</p>\n<p>Idea of the game is to build a pipe going through the map from one end to the other, while monsters (cute ones) want to destroy your pipe.
