The game features the team from Outhouse Media.<br/>\n\nThe idea was born after a couple of weeks of brainstorming, when we saw that online games are still very popular in many regions around the world.\n\n\nWe wanted to give the players the chance to play along with the team from their country and play with their fellow gamers in a special way.\n\n\nSo we decided to seek the approval of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and famous Chinese gamer, Luo Guangzhu. He was instrumental in organizing the Chinese Special Game Convention in New York City.\n\n\nThe game is in the final stages of development and we call on you, players, to help us to bring it to the world.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5f02f2296da770fb06bc409f53412f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
