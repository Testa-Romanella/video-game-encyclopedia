Up to 100 combo they also increase in frequency.</p><p>All the assets, music and sprites were self made. The sprites were created during the 1 hour (pretty timewasting idea), the music was already available to me from a past project</p><p>My highest combo is 265 by the way, see if you can beat that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/360/36030307e8e6e0fdac95b84621882b71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["digaly"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
