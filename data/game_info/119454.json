Take a ship spec and build it quickly to earn points.</p><p><strong>How to play</strong><br/></p><p>A trireme is made up on individual ship sections: the front, middle sections with or without a sail, and the tail. Once an order comes in, you start working from front to tail, following the on-screen instructions to make the necessary materials for each section. Your active section will be highlighted yellow underneath it in the work order, and will turn green on completion. Each work item in a section requires one material to start (either a tree or a sail). Complete all the sections to finish the order and earn bonus points.</p><p><em>Tip: Don't forget to check which color the sail is and apply the correct paint prior to painting!</em><br/></p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p><em>Uses the PICO-8 control scheme</em></p><ul><li>(X) - Z,C,N</li><li>(O) - X,V,M</li><li>Directions - Arrow keys</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/538/5380f9ecf09942fcf0f6cf88f5d5971e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["mkosler"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
