{"id": 658471, "slug": "rolans-curse-reimagined", "name": "Rolan's Curse Reimagined", "name_original": "Rolan's Curse Reimagined", "description": "<p>After centuries of being imprisoned, the evil Lord Barius has escaped and is terrorizing the land of Rolan. Turning villagers into monster slaves, cursing the land to a never ending darkness, forbidding anyone to enjoy sunlight and happiness. Embark on a quest as Aedin, the young fighter eager to prove loyalty to Rolan, or play as Derick the battle-hardened veteran who's no stranger to war. Who will answer the call to free Rolan? The choice is yours. Navigate through the forests, crawl through the caves, get lost in the castle mazes, enjoy the sandy beaches as you make your way closer to finding and defeating Barius and freeing\u00a0 the land of\u00a0Rolan from his clutches. This work was an effort to remaster the forgotten\u00a0original made by American Sammy Co. in 1990. With the help of game's first livestream, I can also see that this game still has some issues that can be worked out, such as improved tutorial, and including controller support. I will be actively working on addressing these issues as best as I can. In the meantime, please enjoy what's available and stay tuned for updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T08:21:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b917ea7a2eb6237cc38aad07d4ee37a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Armageddon  Gaming"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
