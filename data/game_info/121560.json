It was made over 48 hours for Teacart1k game jam. You're a lonely farmer who watches over a modest plot of land. One day you notice your grounds seem to be controlled by forces outside your universe...</p>\n<p><strong>Feature</strong></p>\n<ul><li>DAY/NIGHT SYSTEM</li><li>REAL TIME CLOCK</li><li>PARTICLE EFFECT</li><li>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED TILES</li><li>2 ITEMS</li></ul>\n<p>This is more of a quick toy than a game. Sadly I didn't have much time during the jam. The initial state of your farm is calculated from the contents of Misc0. Every few seconds the state of your farm is hashed and put into Misc0 and Misc1. The time/season/player name are also read, and MapX and MapY are written based on those values. None of the booleans are used at the moment.</p>\n<p>Source available here: https://github.com/leafo/sharecart-1</p>\n<p>Made with love2d 0.9.2</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Arrows - move</li><li>C,V - do things</li><li>Also works with joystick</li><li>ESC to quit</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fc/3fc163ec0bb9ad644140fd99d4ff292d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["leafo"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
