{"id": 102140, "slug": "the-somerton-man", "name": "The Somerton Man", "name_original": "The Somerton Man", "description": "<p>On 1 December 1948, a body was found on Somerton Beach in Adelaide, Australia. From there unfolded one of the most perplexing (and still unsolved) mysteries of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>This game seeks to recreate the experience of the 1948-1949 investigation. It is the first in a series (hopefully?) where I go back over miscellaneous ideas I've had for games over the past five or so years, using them as a starting point for experiments in form and design.</p>\n<p>I completed this game in less than 72 hours, so don't expect a comprehensive recreation of the case. In particular, the game intentionally excludes information and theories that arose after 1949. If you want more detail on the case, there are a heap of sources available, but the Wikipedia article is fairly comprehensive as is 'The Unknown Man' by G M Feltus (if you can find a copy).</p>\n<p>As always, thoughts and comments are welcome, and you can contact me at colestia3@gmail.com or @colestia3 on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Additional credits:</p>\n<p>Pencil Doodles: Designed by Freepik</p>\n<p>Cardenio Modern font by Nils Cordes<br/></p>\n<p>Music: Passacaglia in C minor, BWV 582 by JS Bach, performed by Yayoi Yoshida.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING: </strong>Mac and Linux builds are entirely untested, as I don't have access to either OS. <br/></p><p>If you like the games I'm making, please consider supporting me on Patreon.
