It is said in the tutorial but I thought I write it here again.<br/>I hope it is fun although I didn't have enough time to make more exciting levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme interpretation</strong><br/>The theme (\"Collaborate with AI\")\u00a0 is interpreted as you helping the computer to finish the game so it can be played.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Images and music</strong><br/>All the artwork (excluding two characters my sister made and three icons I used), as well as the music,\u00a0is made by me.</p>\n<p>Please share your thoughts with me in the comments\u00a0so I can improve my game-making skills.<br/>Have fun playing it\u00a0 :3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T20:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ab/6ab18697cb9ef70701794c61c89454cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MentixHD"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
