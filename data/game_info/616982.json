I'm only now discovering that the fully functional game I had in the Unity editor is completely non-functional now. Better luck next time, I guess. I'll\u00a0be making this one playable\u00a0for upload after\u00a0the Jam window.\u00a0The\u00a0*systems*\u00a0are all\u00a0there,\u00a0and\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0see the barest concept of\u00a0what we were going\u00a0for, but everything initializes\u00a0wrong\u00a0on the\u00a0first level.<br/></p>\n<p>If you're interested in playing and aren't afraid of jumping through a few hoops, you *can* unstick the game. Use the magnetic tether to attach a piece of debris to the \"nose\" gun of the ship, then press spacebar to fire it. Destroying a connected object will update all the component tiles of the ship, giving you the fuel and thrust that you're lacking.</p>\n<p>Still, the build version has a *lot* of bugs I need to work out that the editor version didn't have.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T04:42:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73b/73b578041cf1e8217a8d05bb2f26f402.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ralvuimego"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
