Destination: AZOR LAB.</p><p>Nobody knows what happened to the last expedition who visited AZOR... your mission? You must recover the lost files about the \"experiment\", remember you promised to your beloved that you would come back home alive... but you must be fast once you landed because oxygen is limited... Remember: You are the only one who can do it, Earth is counting on you!!</p><p>After 4 LDs HelkeGames is back with a new project: \"Azor\"!<br/>I would have liked to make a longer story with other features but... We got only 72 hours so... we did our best! The theme was \"Entire game on one screen\" and I tried to use one screen for the whole game but I couldn't show all the rooms in one screen for 2 reasons: it would be a bit slowly to load all the instances in the same room and... Since I tried to make a great story (even if short) I don't want to spoil it... Players shall finish the game and see the end by themselves!</p><p>Thanks everybody for making every LD so awesome! You guys rock!</p><p>COMMANDS:</p><p>- ARROWS TO MOVE<br/>- Z TO JUMP</p><p>HELKEGAMES TEAM</p><p>- Giuseppe \"Joe\" Recupero \uc870\uc149 CEO - Concept/Story - Art - Programming</p><p>- Claudio Palana - Art - Splash Screens - Music - Trailer</p><p>Have fun with AZOR! </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1a/e1acb6defc6722d78987a4e9cf16f314.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 102, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["HelkeGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
