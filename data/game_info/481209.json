You can aim your shot while sitting in the barrel but don't wait too long to shoot; the world moves slower once you've fired, giving you more control of the bullet and more time before the enemies reach the shooter.</p>\n<p>Made in about 3 days for the 2020 Low-Rez Game Jam. The game uses a script on the camera to clamp all pixels into 64x64 grid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it and I'd love feedback on the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-17T04:09:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/890/890db9101765c0001ddd5069a80f2abd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WillReardon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
