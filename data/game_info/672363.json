{"id": 672363, "slug": "cologne-3d", "name": "Cologne 3D", "name_original": "Cologne 3D", "description": "In Cologne 3D, explore the historic Old Market in the old town and Gottfried-Hagen-Str. in Cologne-Kalk (the office of the developer!) and get an idea of what it looks like there today. You can also see 3D views of the past of some houses. There is also the option to play an audio about some houses and the Jan von Werth fountain on the Old Market. Two types of advertising pillars can also be placed on the Old Market. The version is a kind of technical demo to show what is possible and should be expanded in the future if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe project development will be continuing. The areas and places in Cologne that can be viewed are to be enlarged and expanded.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are two versions. Both for PC, one in 3D and one for virtual reality.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat version is not free of errors, the controls are not optimized and we do not guarantee that it will run.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNote: Both versions start in German language. The language of parts (like the Old Market) can be changed.<br/>\r\nPlease have a look on the short manual to see the controls, in German and English.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T02:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c32cbb93f7d021f2d477c1c748c42346.jpg", "website": "http://www.koeln-3d.de/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sunlight Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Sunlight Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
