This is a game I originally had the idea for back with Ludum Dare 45's theme \"Start with nothing\", which explains the whole no clothes thing. It's a straightforward high score game and my attempt to make something streamlined enough that no mechanic could be taken out of the game without compromising the whole experience. Hope you have fun with it! Feel free to flex your high scores or let me know what can be tweaked in the comments.<br/></p>\r\nPress space to jump, space again to attack, and down arrow to slide.
