{"id": 317447, "slug": "so-you-want-to-be-a-squire", "name": "So, You Want to Be a Squire?", "name_original": "So, You Want to Be a Squire?", "description": "<p>This\r\nis a game where you play a squire who dreams of becoming\u00a0a knight. To\r\naccomplish this you will need to prove yourself by supporting other knights on their missions and thus\u00a0earn enough renown to make your way to knighthood. So before\r\nstarting your mission make sure you stock up on supplies. Buy up potions for\r\nyour knight's health, swords for when your knight is only left with fisticuffs, shields for when your knight is without defense, and rations for when your\r\nknight's tummy is making the rumblies. Next, enter the mission that you choose\r\nwith your knight. During the mission make sure to help your knight and collect\r\nlots of treasure so your knight spreads the word of your greatness and earn\r\nyour renown.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a\r\nnew take on the RPG genre, where instead of playing as a knight you are playing\r\na squire trying to make it to knighthood. There is more of a focus on resource\r\nmanagement. Our advice--don't walk into walls!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-10T05:58:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb2/cb27293e76a0a07e8ac69dc48d89d81f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 238, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Distractor-Factory"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
