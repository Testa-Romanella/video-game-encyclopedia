This thought quickly disappeared into the fog surrounding him, when he passed through the gates of the dungeon to find the largest eyeball he'd ever seen. Would he forever remain just Ed, or could he become Talent Ed? <br/><br/><strong>Talented</strong> is an arcade roguelite shoot 'em up with randomly generated skill trees.  Survive 20 nights and beat the dungeon to unlock all four classes, each with unique Talent packages and abilities. Level up the class core abilities, and search the Talent tree for in game upgrades.  <br/><br/>Send a hail of arrows, conjure powerful spells or call upon an army of snails to hold back the demons.
