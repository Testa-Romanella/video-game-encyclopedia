In fact, all of the files got deleted by the visowo. the visowo(not to be mistaken by novisor) is a extremely sus imposter that causes ppl to go insane and do crazy things. Things like playing fortnite. Disgusting. This pirated copy of amogus vs impsoter: battle for susville is extremelly sus and you may have to vent in order to play. in this game the visowo will travel to however many dimensions i feel like adding in and delete everything.<br/><br/>note: features copyrighted music</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T03:53:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ee/4ee03ffc8298965d39d91863dd50ae05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JThburvs"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
