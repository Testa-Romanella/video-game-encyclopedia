They had become known on the island for their music and especially for their technique in strumming the guitar with a shot glass in the bars of the island. During this time time there was a great political distress in Puerto Rico but these two artists still had the will to create and make meaningful music. \u00a0The songs featured in this game are sung by Ton\u00edn Ortiz and the guitarist is my grandfather, Efrain Santiago. <br/></p>\n<p>Although my grandfather passed away in 1994, his name and his music will continue to live on in my creations to be presented to an audience worldwide. <br/></p>\n\n<p>Created by:</p>\n<p>Johnny Wu (Artist)<br/></p>\n<p>Marlon Gonzalez (Programmer)<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T02:44:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f53/f537cfacda64514a03fb45e550b90ce5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["newworldcircuit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
