Easy mouse control and funny puzzles make the game accessible for anyone. Although there\u2019s the catch\u2026 There\u2019s too much death and blood in it. Bunny will have to avoid all the traps and enemies to get to his Carrot. And sometimes it takes more than one try to do that\u2026<br/><br/><strong>From the developer.</strong><br/>Actually I don\u2019t know what to say. Despite its childish style the game has lots of blood and gore. I wouldn\u2019t show it to children\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T17:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a6/4a6c81c4b32f42d8020db60bc4ff115f.jpg", "website": "https://www.loginovskikh.com/", "rating": 3.17, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 83, "beaten": 2, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 76, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anatoliy Loginovskikh"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anatoliy Loginovskikh"], "esrb_rating": null}
