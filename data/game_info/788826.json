It was originally inspired by\u00a0'Devil Dice' (or 'XI' in Japan, Playstation 1, 1998)&gt;, with it's ingenious dice matching concept; all code was written without reference to the original source, and new controls, timings and gameplay details were added for better keyboard/dirpad/touch gameplay. During development it was first written in C++ over OpenGL for Windows 98, adapted to Win32 GDI for Windows CE touch support, then C# over DirectX for Windows XP, and now C# over Unity 2020 for WebGL (iOS/Android/Linux versions available seperatly).\r\n</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<p>Lewey Geselowitz\u00a0- Gameplay<br/>Jean-Pierre Allers\u00a0- 3D Modeling<br/>Richard Bermudez\u00a0- Co-Development<br/>James Mathew - Soundtrack and Music<br/>Lissette Berlanga - Testing and Girlfriend</p></li>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-20T17:39:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5d/b5d825268a564efe265cef74b40b857d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["lewcid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
