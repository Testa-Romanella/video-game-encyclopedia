Keep in mind that there is not a single path, each biome have multiples breaches, from 2 to 4 (except for 2 biomes, which have only one breach each).</p>\n<p>There are also some monoliths (little stone with a white sphere in it) which you can interact with. One of the idea behind this was to be able to find messages, wrote by other players in their own game, and be able to write messages too, like throwing a bottle into the ocean, using online services (but it's not implemented).</p><p>____________________</p>\n<p>Made by these 4 students in Game Design at ICAN, Paris :</p>\n<ul><li>Apollinaire Behra Le\u00a0Cam (Suburban_Scum on itch.io)</li><li>Bekir Kilinc (Enlocke on itch.io)</li><li>Margaux Muller</li><li>Charly Rousseaux (myself, Eshe)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec9/ec973a2a80ef314e8b4c153185123b9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eshe"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
