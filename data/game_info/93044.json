Butterly? ARG!!!), that I made a different kind of mistake. In some tiers I didn\u2019t specify that the Main Stories and Epilogues rewards are for Steam only. But then I got to looking into the availability of promo codes for the mobile devices, seeing if the big two changed their policy from the last time I checked.</p>\n<p>From my research last year, I knew that Google Play allowed 500 promo codes to developers every quarter for apps and in-app items, but Apple was finicky and only allowed codes for the app itself, not the in-app items, which didn\u2019t help us. A Very Important Date was always planned for a mobile release, but giving free stories to backers for mobile seemed like it wasn\u2019t going to be doable in our last try at Kickstarter because of Apple\u2019s weird policies. So being under this impression, we kept the Stories/Epilogues tier rewards Steam exclusive for this campaign.</p>\n<p>Well, things have changed it seems. Google Play\u2019s policy has remained the same, which is great. Apple, however, has changed their policy to allow 100 codes per in-app item up to total of 1,000 codes max during a 6 month period. Once that code is generated it only has a lifespan of 28 days, though. That\u2019s great, although weirdly limited.</p>\n<p>So the way it looks right now, we\u2019re tentatively saying that\u00a0<strong>backers with Stories/Epilogue tier rewards can choose between Steam, iOS, or Android versions</strong>, bearing any changes to Apple\u2019s or Google Play\u2019s policies between now and the time of A Very Important Date\u2019s release. If there are any changes, the Steam release will still be our go to.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo 2.2 is now available!

But this isn't the typical Alice in Wonderland styled story! While A Very Important Date takes a few notes from the Carroll classics, you don't have to be a big fan of them to enjoy this game for its rich dialogue, witty humor, and unique art style!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOur story follows Alison Sunderlund, an average small town Ohio girl. By day she can be found working as a server in a local caf\u00e9 and by night she takes care of her house and family: her dad and younger brother. Though she doesn't have a lot on her plate, the life she has gives her very little free time. But Alison's life changes one morning when she wakes up sitting under a tree in a brand new world.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tConfused, Alison sets out to discover more about her new surroundings, accidentally stumbling upon the Arkwright estate, home of Gwyn Arkwright and The Looking Glass Caf\u00e9. With no place to go and a way back home seeming impossible, Gwyn, being the kind soul that he is, gives Alison a job and a place to stay for the time being. Everything's peachy except... now Alison must choose which of The Looking Glass' five employees will train her!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWill Alison stick with what she knows and remain a server? Will she a cut a new path as a cook's assistant? Will she wipe away her past burdens as a low-level dishwasher? Will Alison ever figure out what strange world she's in? Will she ever return to her old life?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tWill she want to?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tAll stories\r\nare written by No\u00eblle Hyzy, the winner of Voltage Inc.'s 4th Annual International Script Writing Contest for Romance Apps.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>8 suitors</li>\n<li>Expressive animated characters</li>\n<li>12 chapters for each Suitor's Main Story</li>\n<li>3 possible endings per Main Story</li>\n<li>3 chapter Epilogues for each Suitor</li>\n<li>40+ hours of content across all stories</li>\n<li>\u224850,000 words per Main Story</li>\n<li>300,000+ words across the whole game</li>\n<li>At least 6 CGs per Main Story</li>\n<li>Main character CG options</li>\n<li>12 amazing tracks from Composer Geoff Moore</li>\n<li>60+ beautiful backgrounds</li>\n<li>Episodic content</li>\n<li>Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>\n<li>Available for iOS and Android.</li></ul>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis demo consists of our game's prologue, where we introduce Alison, build the wondrous town of Mimsboro, and give players a glimpse of the Looking Glass crew.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tTo pull up the in-game menu outside of the main menu, press P or ESC.  \r\n\t<strong>Note:</strong> some programs render the ESC key inoperable when running in conjunction with other programs, this demo included.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Features include:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save/Load/Delete</li>\n<li>CG/Event Illustration toggle</li><li>Quit Menu that allows you to go back to the Main Menu</li><li>Tutorial Screen at the beginning of the Prologue</li>\n<li>More in-game content\r\n\t<ul>\n<li>Gwyn's First Chapter(s) with choices</li>\n<li>Emil's First Chapter(s) with choices</li><li>Rory's First Chapter(s) with choices</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNa\u00efve Sprites is an indie otome game group that's currently developing our first visual novel. Our goal is to make stories that all of you wonderful people want to read. We hope to shake-up the visual novel market with more westernized stories, while still retaining the beautiful anime inspired art of the otome genre's roots.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em><strong>A Very Important Date</strong></em> started as Noelle's passion project in June 2014.  She'd grown to love visual novels and the otome genre and felt that it was time to tell one of her own stories.  But ambition took over, and the Important Date lore grew to the epic story that it is now.  So to help reign in the project, Noelle found other like-minded individuals along the way to make sure that this big game got made.\r\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No\u00eblle Hyzy</strong>: Project Director, Executive Producer, Lead Writer, Character Concept, Background Concept</li>\n<li><strong>Justin V</strong>: Co-Writer, Editor, Art Editor, Background Concept, and GUI Artist</li>\n<li>kooriesque: Character Concept Artist</li>\n<li>darkenmarr: Sprite and CG Artist</li>\n<li>furude: BG, GUI, and Game Icon Arist</li>\n<li>lordless: BG Artist</li>\n<li><strong>IchBinJager and Wolfborg</strong>: Programmers</li>\n<li>Geoff Moore: Composer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kickstarter</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Patreon</li>\n<li>DeviantArt</li>\n<li>Lemma Soft Forums</li>\n<li>Fuwanovel Forums</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24a/24aac34028d55de9e71974a6485741fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Na\u00efve Sprites"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
