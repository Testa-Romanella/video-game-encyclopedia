Despite not being the greatest artist, I was able to develop the whole game without depending on the internet for characters or decorations.</p>\n<p>In creating this game, it was important for me to improve my graphic skills in order to be able to truly give a voice to my imagination, and add to my program savviness. Indeed, whats worse than not being able to express a great idea for a character or background because of a lack of available images? I have been pleasantly surprised by the results and no longer depend on internet ressources!<br/></p>\n\r\nAnimal wellfare\r\n\r\nHow are your donations used?\r\n<p>The donations and benefits generated by the advertising will be used to buy cat food which will be donated to the\u00a0APCLO\u00a0(Association for the Protection of Free Cats of Orl\u00e9ans). The association collects, treats, identifies and sterilizes stray cats before freeing them or putting them up for adoption.</p>\n<p>The association acts mainly thanks to donations. This is why I decided to monetize this game to help the APCLO, thanks to whom I now live with Leo:</p>\n\n<p>Profits generated by advertising can only be cashed in\u00a0once they have passed the $100 mark. This sum will therefore be considered as a victory if reached, as it would allow for the purchase of about 20 kg of animal food. Subsequently, if the game is still a success and if the public (you!) actually wish for it, part of the profits could be used to further develop the game or work on a sequel.</p>\r\nHow to participate ?\r\n<p>If you wish to participate financially, it is possible to\u00a0make a donation directly on the APCLO website\u00a0or make a purchase in the game.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can simply participate by watching an ad through the game, spreading the game to your friends or sharing our collaborative spirit. Every act counts :)</p>\r\n\r\nActions already carried out through donations and benefits:\r\n<p>Here I will report the donations made to the association, accompanied by pictures :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/496861604b0232f73e04f9a7f70c450b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Maarti"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
