Late at night, one of the town's citizens is murdered in cold blood! In a time when the local cops suspiciously underplay the incident, only one man - our lovable, bumbling everyguy Herbie - has the clinical insanity necessary to take the law into his own hands and fight the tides of corruption that threaten the town which TourAdvisor once called 'just the nicest place you could ever think of!'<br/>\n<br/>\r\nJoin Herbie and his crime fighting, alley hoppin' kitty Katt LeChatt as they... lounge around their house looking for Herbie's keys.
