Score-Attack! Penguins! Eggs! Even a Dragon! </p><p><strong>So what is it?</strong> </p> <ul><li>It's you, the player, against an un-ending tsunami of not-quite-happy Penguins, how long can you keep your belly full while getting some mean scores? </li></ul> <p><strong>What's in it?</strong> </p> <ul><li>A variety of Penguin types - Including one that throws snowballs at you! </li><li>Multiple game areas that spawn as you play - Jump from the main area to another to try and get a score boost! </li><li>Pick-up the eggs before they hatch to get special abilities/allies for a period of time! </li></ul> <p><strong>How do I play it?</strong><br/> We have a tutorial splash in-game but to summarise: </p> <ul><li>Movement is the standard WASD </li><li>To attack you mash that SPACEBAR </li><li>To use a picked-up egg, press the F key with the might of an Inuit! </li></ul> <p><strong>So wait how does it play?</strong> </p> <ul><li>The game is a score-attack: Try and get more score than your friends before you're hunger bar runs out; </li><li>The problem is that the penguins are you're main way of getting that bar back up, attack and kill them and get that hunger up whilst getting a neat little dab of score. </li><li>However get close and they'll attack you back! Damaging you and dealing a snippet of pain to your score amount. </li><li>This is where speed comes into play once more - get to an egg before it hatches and you grab it for yourself! </li><li>If you have an egg, you'll be able to break it open, using it for a buff contained inside! Such as invincibility, or a tuna can to attract the penguins away from you for a second. </li><li>That isn't to say these are the only ways to get score - no, no, in fact as time goes one you may notice the other sheets of ice rise out of the ocean! </li><li>(Don't ask how this works) </li><li>On each is a different way to achieve the score of titans - Run around a maze and run your luck with the Treasure Chests inside, or run away from a Dragon as you claim it's gold!</li></ul><p><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong><br/> As a team we have attempted to test this build to the best of our abilities, but we are only so many and have only so much free time to test; So expect bugs; if you encounter any, please message us the problem and how you encountered this, sorry for any inconvenience, and we'll try to get a new build out as soon as we can. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03f/03fea705033d7247cc58352ea986667a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["BigHandInSky"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
