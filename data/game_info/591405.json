Luckily you have been permitted to take part in the D.E.E.P., a  program to help debtors tug at their bootstraps.\r\n</p>\n<p>On the face of  it, mining out a seemingly desolate world in the Inner Arm all alone,  until your debt is paid off or you perish, seems like an agonizing waste  of time. However the alternatives offer only worse prospects.\r\n</p>\n<p>D.E.E.P.  participants often come out the other side as leathery withered  versions of themselves, if at all. But at least those few make it out at  all and can go back to consuming Argus Megacorp\u2019s products guilt free  for a while. Perhaps you will be as lucky\u2026 maybe even more so.\r\n</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Left Click to select buildings and options\r\n</li><li>Right Click to close menus\r\n</li><li>W/S or Up/Down or Mouse Wheel to move the camera up or down\r\n</li><li>PageUp/PageDown to do it faster\r\n</li><li>A/D or Left/Right or Mouse Left/Right buttons to move the camera left or right\r\n</li><li>Escape to quit at any time\r\n</li></ul>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>Try to get your debt back to zero by selling resources obtained from smartly (more so luckily) placed extractors.\r\n</p>\n<p>Click  on a room to see your options. Any room can have a tunnel built off of  it for the cost of one mineral. Only newly built, unimproved rooms can  be specialized into three different buildings:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Extractor: mines out whatever resource the room is placed directly on top of. Cost: 1 mineral\r\n</li><li>Sensor: reveals resource locations within a longer range than regular rooms. Cost: 1 mineral\r\n</li><li>Fortification: flex on your homies. Time constraints blocked the completion of this feature. Cost: 1 mineral\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>To  survive on the hostile WASP-143 d, you need to consume one unit of 3  resources daily. Oxygen, Water, and Food are all measured in one-day  units. You consume these units at 6 in the morning like clockwork  because you\u2019re weird like that. If you don\u2019t have at least one unit of  these resources at 6 then it\u2019s Game Over.\r\n</p>\n<p>Aside from eating things  you pulled out of the ground, you can also buy any resource for  delivery straight to your space helipad. These of course cost more to  buy than sell, and add to your debt. Don\u2019t worry though, the D.E.E.P.  won\u2019t mind getting some more time out of you!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T05:11:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6c/d6cccb6ee19380c170b3cfe28604856f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Kramdar"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
