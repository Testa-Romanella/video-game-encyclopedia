I am a fresh CS graduate and this is my first experience in game development. I hope you enjoy! I tried to make a fun game where you can experience playing the drums in a live concert. Please don't think of this as a drum simulation, but rather an entertaining rhythm game. The beats you hit on the drums as the songs play don't really reflect what notes you hit on the drums in front of you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is really simple. Just choose a song, select a location, and start hitting the \"star\" beats as they come!<br/><br/>The beats in the game were all \"AI\" generated using a pipeline I put together that consisting of 2 different open source drum separation and drum transcription algorithms, along with some algorithms I wrote to skim the results for a better user experience. Sometimes you might get irrelavent beats while playing, but all in all I think it did a pretty good job to create a nice, fun experience that largely follows the rhythm of the song. But again, it is no where close to a drum simulation. Just a fun rhythm game.<br/><br/>For now this is just a demo that contains 6 great songs. If you like the job the \"AI\" did, I am also planning release an \"Unlimited\" version of the game with a lot more songs and support for generating the beats of your own songs using the \"AI\". It will probably cost 3-4$ on \"itch.io\". I will make the beat generating pipeline public and you can very simply install a program called Docker, run a simple command showing where your music is, and the algorithm will generate the beats for your songs. You can than put them in your game and start playing anything you like!</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong><br/>Game engine: Unity3D<br/>Asset production: Blender<br/><br/><strong>3D Assets<br/></strong>Bass Guitar 3D Asset: Geug from Sketchfab<br/>Electric Guitar 3D Asset: Fernando Freire from Sketchfab<br/>All others: mertbbicak from Sketchfab<br/><br/><strong>Animations</strong></p>\n<p>Adobe Mixamo</p>\n<p><strong>Music</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Rations : rationsband.bandcamp.com<br/>Punk Rock Opera : facebook.com/PunkRockOperaProject/<br/>Jahzzar : jahzzar.bandcamp.com<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Crowd Sounds<br/></strong>By Spanac from freesoundslibrary.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:11:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbdfbae56a6091f42c323858ea837a93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["mertbbicak"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
