The game was originally released in Japan as Serizawa Nobuo no Birdie Try (\u82b9\u6ca2\u4fe1\u96c4\u306e\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4, \"Nobuo Serizawa's Birdy Try\").</p>\n<p>The general theme of Mecarobot Golf is a near-futuristic golf course where humanoid robots are considered to be second-class citizens. A robot named Eagle is blocked from participating in the world's professional golfing tournaments due to discrimination. Eagle has the ability to play golf better than a human being but is denied the chance to do so. A benefactor purchases Eagle and builds a golf course for him to practice on. The player's skill determine whether humans or robots are truly better at golf. Various modes (lesson, driving range, competition) help the player practice his abilities that he will need in future matches.</p>\n<p>Professional golfer Nobuo Serizawa endorsed the Japanese version of the game. However, the Western version of the game replaced his likeness with Eagle the robot. There are two possible background sounds that can be played while golfing; a simple tune for relaxation or a complex melody for \"excitement.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1992-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:59:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfc/cfc8d7bc79dffc880beb70a51f3bc43b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES"], "developers": ["Advance Communication Company"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Toho"], "esrb_rating": null}
