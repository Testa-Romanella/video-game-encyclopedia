Hello, hello?</em></p>\n<p><em>I wanted to record this message to tell you about\u00a0FNAF GB, it's a uh, a video game based on those old Freddy Fazbear pizza places from way back.</em></p>\n<p><em>So we uh, we found an old GameBoy cartridge covered in dust while clearing out one of the old locations. I can't find anything online about a tie-in game from the 90s, so I guess this was a prototype or something?\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>I mean, I can see why they never realised this thing, it - it's hardly very appropriate for young fans of Freddy's is it?</em></p>\n<p><em>Uh, I thought I'd upload the ROM I extracted here for anyone who wants to take a look for themselves.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em>Just uh, try to avoid playing it at night. N-not that that will affect anything, that's not what I meant. Just that uh, screens late at night y'know? Bad for the eyes... yeah, bad for the eyes...</em></p>\n<p><em>See you on the flip-side.\"</em></p>\n<p>Fnaf GB is a fanmade demake of the original Five Nights at Freddy's game. It was made using GB Studio, the downloadable ROM file should be compatible with GameBoy emulators and flash carts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All credit for the original game goes to Scott Cawthon.<br/></p>\n<p>Z / J keys - A button<br/></p>\n<p>X / K keys - B button</p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow keys - D Pad</p>\n<p>Enter - Start Button</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T21:26:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf3307e5c23d28c44cf94bf20bf5d02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Goatkeeper.png"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
