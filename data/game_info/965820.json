Alongside this steely eyed woman are the Knight-Errant Caelyn, a rambunctious young woman with hopeful dreams and a sword to back it up, and the Hierophant Cyrano, a helpful 'heretic' and all around mage that keeps things level for the group.

Will you end up betrothed to the overlord? Perhaps stuck in a warehouse for eternity sorting bones? The choices are yours! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlongside the blend of new and old mechanics and stories is the introduction of modern mechanics such as ability and upgrade tuning through gems! Crafting new items! And mid-combat status effects that can turn the battle upside down in an instant! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOther features include: LGBT inclusivity! Dolls! And of course, Corgis!
