We were 4 working during the 72 hours (Elie Paquiet, Valentin Sophys, Tom Costemend and I, Robin Six).</p>\n<p>Loneliness is an immersive first person\u00a0game where you're walking through a motel. We were not really inspired by the theme, and because we didn't want to create a game with a basic idea, we decided to create a game from the idea that inspired us the most.</p>\n<p>We eventually made a game that we like and that allowed each one of us to learn things and experiment (which is great since we are students and want to keep on learning and discovering things in our main skill areas). And after all, game jams are also made to have fun and learn, aren't they ? :D</p>\n<p>/!\\<br/>Due to the short development time we did not really optimize the game and there are some issues with the web version. You can still experience it on your browser, it takes a few minutes to load but it works even if there are some shaders missing and other little problems like that, but don't hesitate to download it on your computer for a much better outcome ! :) Thanks for your understanding !<br/>/!\\</p>\n<p>Hope you guys will like the game !<br/>Cheers !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e2/0e227532ea67fe462aff6cf6b26df18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Saering"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
