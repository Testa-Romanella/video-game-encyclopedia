Here are some tips to make it easier\u2026</p><ul><li>Don't boost all the time! Take it slow</li><li>Don't chase asteroids, try setting up a head on collision early, even when the asteroid is still off screen</li><li>Get your trajectory and the asteroids trajectory to intersect</li><li>The trajectory colour gives you information about the timing at the intersection. If your trajectory markers and the asteroids trajectory markers colour match at intersection, you are probably going to collide (You might want to be there a bit earlier to change your direction)</li></ul>Here is a demonstration of how to make an asteroid hit your planet:Info about evaluation:<ul><li>Mass of asteroids ranges from 4 to 16 (based on size)</li><li>Atmosphere ranges from 0.2 to 1 (independent from size, based on particle amount, kind of hard to tell)</li><li>Water ranges from 0.2 to 1 (independent from size, based on the water to dirt ratio on asteroid)</li><li>Evaluation is a bit harsh\u2026 My personal best is 87% if you feel like beating that</li></ul><br/><strong>Link to ludum dare page:</strong><br/><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/crater-crea...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a2/9a2891c0b2b1be50d192d5e5d6e1ce18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["navot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
