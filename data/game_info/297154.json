Produced by The New Dimension in 2018 for Reset issue 12's Mix-I-Disk. Each level consists of its own atmospheric upbeat in game music (Unless you choose sound effects of course), and also some challenging game play.<br/></p>\n<p>It\r\nis the year 2195. Planet Earth was severely damaged by intergalactic\r\nalien rebel forces. War raged over the galaxy. Earth remains\r\ninhabitable, not many people or animals survived, apart from a few.\r\nThe human race and dog race were transported to the one of the RB2017\r\nrescue space stations, which was later on attacked by the same alien\r\nrebel forces. Enter one brave commander to stop this atrocity. That\r\nis of course YOU.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Graphics by <strong>Shaun Pearson</strong><br/>Programming and music by <strong>Richard Baayliss</strong><br/>IRQ Tape loader by <strong>Martin Piper</strong><br/>Loading bitmap by <strong>Shaun Pearson <br/></strong>Music demo bitmap by <strong>JonEgg<br/></strong>Exomizer level decrompression source by Magnus Lind<br/></p>\n<p>(C) 2019 The New Dimension and Reset - As freeware.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T05:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47a16ec9bc0ef9eec389dcfdce3bb29b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Richard of TND"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
