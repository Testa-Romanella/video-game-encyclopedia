So here it is free to play~ I'll get the license and continue development if enough people like it.</p>\n<p>It's an escape game where you find and use objects or solve puzzles to overcome obstacles. Think something like Monkey Island but much simpler.</p>\n<p>The story is about someone called the Outsider who wakes up in the middle of a prison with a magic circle on the floor. It's up to you to break out and find out what happened from the environmental story telling.</p>\n<p>The nuance is grim with dark story and desaturated coloration. Albeit lacking, I tried my best to use a rather olden, fantasy English for the literacy. 'Ere's hoping I've done good enough at it.</p>\n<p>So there's about it! Enjoy~! n0n/</p>\n<p>P.S.: Don't worry, it's not horror~.</p>\n\n<p>You can also support me in other ways.
