It's an arcade-style aggressive space shooter in which you play as a cat, in a spaceship that also looks like a cat. Test your skills against an enemy fleet of mice and more!</p>\n<p>For best results, use a controller or gamepad. Otherwise:</p>\n<p>Press Enter to start!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> to move, <strong>M</strong> to fire, <strong>K</strong> to shield. When you die, press <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Space</strong> to restart. P to mute the music.</p>\n<p>If you time your shield correctly, you will reflect projectiles with it, regain some of your shield, and regenerate health faster. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Check out Dan's portfolio to see more of his work, and tune in on twitch Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4pm and Sundays at noon, EST.</p>\n\n<p>version history:</p>\n<p>1.0 - uploaded game.</p>\n<p>1.01 - increased rate of sustained fire, increased number of enemies, nerfed cows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1fa/1fa50675861f0487be79d12afda4c0cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["gameDangerous"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
