By clicking on the screen you get coins which you can invest to buy a base turtle. Turtles grand you more coins per second. When you have 2 Turtles of the same kind you can merge them and increase your coins per click.</p>\n\n<p>This game is not balanced and lacks gameplay. But I am okay with how it turned out. My first time using Unity and trying to finish a project.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-14T03:11:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e90/e90b32adeaa67eb581e18775a18fb7bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sillus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
