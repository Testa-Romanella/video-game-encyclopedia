The school installed sensors to track the electricity consumption of its building, including students apartments, in real time.</p><p>Our part is to develop a game within the app to make it more fun and encourage students to use the app regularly while at the same, time address the issue of energy consumption. From that came the idea of using a pet, that the player has to take care of, both by playing the game and saving energy in real world. To motivate and encourage discussion about energy consumption, the pet's environment is affected by all players energy consumption. If the player takes care of both his/hers consumption and pet, he/she is awarded by getting to play the minigame. </p>The main challenges we are facing are to make the players care about their pet, to make them understand the connection between the game and their real electricity consumption to balance the in-game reward/penalty with the player's energy savings in real world and, of course, to wrap it all in an entertaining experience!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b5/6b5356667d2bcbe8599698e3970a8d18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["carlosgonzalez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
