The theme for this week is New Narrative Forms. I have to find ways to create a narration from different sources, data, interactive processes and generative methods. I created a game by using this premise which looks like this:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>A human wants to join the party of monsters that he always hears under the bed. He finds human parties boring as he feels left out due to awkward situations and he tries his best to approach others but they turn him away. Also, he finds that the taste of music played at the parties of the human world is boring, hence another reason he wants to join the monster party.\r\n</li><li>But every time he tries to approach the bed, the party ends and there is nothing under the bed. It's like the monsters are avoiding him as they are scared of humans.\r\n</li><li>But due to curiosity, the human wants to join the party as he wants to experience how monster\u2019s party. And also he likes the music taste of the monster party.\r\n</li><li>He starts going around the apartment and breaking into other people\u2019s rooms when it's empty to find the right bed to join the party.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Movement</li><li>E - Interact</li><li>RMB - Zoom</li><li>Esc - Pause</li><li>LShift\u00a0 - Run</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T18:57:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24b/24b6688c2c5e6214b36c6dca5481101d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Khatim Javed"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
