The basic idea is to fight slimes and save prisoners the slimes have captured. I am planning to make Goblin Hero a game, like Kingdom New Lands, where you can only move on the x-axis, so you cant jump etc.</p>\n<p><strong>I want your ideas on the game!</strong> What could I add, how could I change it? Tell me if you find bugs.</p>\n<p>Currently I have made the graphics myself, but the goblin's animation is made by Warren Clark. Here is a link to his itch.io:\u00a0https://lionheart963.itch.io/ and here is a link to his goblin sprite:\u00a0https://lionheart963.itch.io/goblin-sprite<br/></p>\n<p>If you are interested in making graphics for the game, contact me. I want the art to be the same art style though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c21/c21e902f353a6c216e770654de2a6b68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vellu126"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
