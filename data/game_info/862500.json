While we were unable to implement the feature that related to this, we wanted to take a moment to explain how this would have worked in a fuller version of this game.\r\n</p>\n<p>The cameras around the room would shine a spotlight. If you were in that light, the captor would be able to see you. Certain actions performed here would trigger dialogue, or potentially level resets if your actions were particularly outlandish or disobedient.
