To accomplish this, you have to constantly install a new package of emergency batteries to the station's generators.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the station's AI knows this, and sends the androids to apprehend you. Fortunately, as per Asimov's rules, the standard servitor bots still have the non-direct harm protocols enabled. However, they can still catch you and make the station's power go out by itself.</p>\n<p>Avoid them, use your wits, manage your time and the space around you. Make sure your mission is a success.
