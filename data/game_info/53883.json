The box art is modeled heavily after the theatrical poster, and the back of the box mentions \"...like it's personal\", perhaps as a reference to said movie's tagline. However, the game does take elements from the first film. It is one of several LJN-published titles produced by the Japanese company Atlus, although Westone was subcontracted to actually develop it.</p>\n<p>There was a separate computer adaptation of the original Jaws movie called Jaws: The Computer Game, released in 1989 by Screen 7 for the Commodore Amiga and for the Commodore 64 as simply Jaws by Box Office Software.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1987-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-14T03:03:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a22/a2235a335d0f1ff7afae8a16633b08d7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 9, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 213, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "NES"], "developers": ["Atlus", "Westone Bit Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["LJN"], "esrb_rating": null}
