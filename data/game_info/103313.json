Ethernalis is a roguelike, dungeon-crawler with RPG elements set in a dark fantasy world represented through game cards.</p>\n<p>Ethernalis is still in alpha stage but we enjoy it already and are full of ideas for making it just the game we always wanted to play. Players can choose their character and discover the world of Ethernal torn by the immediate danger of the undead armies in the roguelike turn based, cross platform card game. </p>\n<p>Collect equipment, cast spells and discover randomly generated dungeons to support Imperial campaigns or join the forces of Evil to unleash the death lurking in the mountain depths for millennia.<br/></p>\n<p>Please note: this is an early access game and is currently under development. We appreciate all your support and we hope you'll enjoy our alpha as much as we do.</p>\n<p>Thanks for you feedback and support o/</p>\n<p>Jack</p>\n<p>Support us on Patreon: www.patreon.com/ethernalis</p>\n<p>Tune in on twitter: @nospoonnocake</p>\n<p>Find out more: www.ethernalis.com </p>\n<p>Like Ethernalis on facebook: www.facebook.com/ethernalis</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd8/dd8f09be3ee578a8dd576de1d191d421.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 223, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Ethernalis"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
