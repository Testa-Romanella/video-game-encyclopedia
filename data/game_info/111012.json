If you fail, the treasure will be lost forever. But don't worry, if you come back to the same NPC after completing another quest, you'll be given another chance.</p><p>It's a very small game but I hope you'll be able to have some fun and comfy time with it.</p><p>By the way, I'll be uploading the models I made for this game since some anon asked for them. Just wait a couple of days.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8be/8bedc9d108f7b68e4a9f523cdc7a3a50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 122, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
