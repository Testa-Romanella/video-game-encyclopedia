It is not at all what I anticipated making when I started, and it's probably not very good. I ran out of time to properly play test it or balance it, but hey - it's finished.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy, but no hard feelings if you don't. This is a game I made to prove to myself that I can actually finish something.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: I took a couple minutes today to fix a couple glaring bugs. Hope that doesn't count as cheating.\u00a0The project is now done to its original intent, with all of its imbalances and design flaws intact.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-03T06:27:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea8/ea8abcca4e93f0e4ac266aa9b6aac593.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kaffe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
