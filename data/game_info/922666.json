What Joe wants is what we all want at one level or another: push our limits, not accept what is imposed on us and go as far as we can. Simply because we can. It's a fully crafted game with a retro, handcrafted aesthetic, reminiscent of the simple magic of the early years of cinema, with references to George M\u00e9li\u00e8s classics like A Trip to the Moon.A logic challenge in the solitude of space, challenging stars and facing the biggest boss in the universe. Well, the biggest boss REALLY.\r\n</p>\n<p>#arcade #retro #altgame\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T08:45:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a5/2a57982c095db02995f8d75d714fdd40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["fuerzastudio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
