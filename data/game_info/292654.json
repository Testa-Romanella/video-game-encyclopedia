In this game, you are a farmer who is irritated by army of birds and other objects and these objects have just one intention, that is to destroy your farm.</p>\n<p>So you decide to shoot out all of them with your short gun and AK-47 rifle. In the game, the difficulty increases as you reach higher stages of it. You will be challenged by weather. Sometimes it will be foggy, sometimes it will be rainy or stormy or any combination of them!</p>\n\n<p>If you like the game and really enjoyed playing it, you can donate me. I will then make even more improved and better games.
