They will uncover the mysterious things that is happening inside the house that might made the viewers scared. The player has to make a decision that will lead either to a bad or good ending of the story. The most interesting part of the story is the part when they knew that there is something going on inside the house. For me the best work that I did was the sounds effects surrounding the game and the part that I\u2019m not really proud of is the images due to the lack of pictures. I could have improved the background images and the pictures attached in each passage. I couldn\u2019t work on the images better due to the lack of time that I have. I have started my twine story a little late and close to the deadline. I took my time thinking of the story I\u2019m supposed to make that is why I started my Twine story close to the deadline and for that I kind of felt a bit sad and the particular reason for that is I could have made my twine even better because I know my strengths and weaknesses</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T09:26:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/1422019147123af37174089f045fae83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lucas_TheB"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
