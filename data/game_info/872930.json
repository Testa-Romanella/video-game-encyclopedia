Find potions ingredients around the map and from enemies. Pick up these ingredients and throw them into the cauldron to make a potion. These potions can be picked up and thrown at the enemies for different effects.</p>\n<p>Context</p>\n<p>This was made in 12 hours of development time in a game jam with the game having to be based around the idea of \"Cauldron\"</p>\n<p>Known bugs</p>\n<p>Spawned in enemies can't lower the cauldrons health. May get fixed but I\u00a0generally do not patch game jam projects after the time is up.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T04:18:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c642ddbc7fe3d4039ef95524c4bca8aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoolGuyMcGee"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
