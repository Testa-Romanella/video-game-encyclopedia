In this game you play as Altiia, a feisty creature named after her passion for high altitudes. On the hunt for treasures and adventure, she has discovered a cluster of islands which have ruins and temples scattered all around. Your journey begins as she has found a way inside a temple where an adaptable staff resides. This staff can be extended at command which can allow her to pole vault with finesse. However, the staff is missing a vital piece which may be hidden on one of the other islands.</em></p>\n<p><em>Explore the islands to find hidden spots and treasures. These treasures let you customize your appearance, so you can traverse the world with style! However, if you\u2019re the type of player who would rather enjoy competitive fun between you and your friends there are timed challenges with leaderboards so you can boast about who made it to the finish line the fastest.</em></p>\n<p>This was our third project at\u00a0Futuregames\u00a0.\u00a0The project spanned for 10 weeks, including 3 weeks for preproduction.\u00a0 The soundtrack for the game can be downloaded here or from the button bellow.</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Amanda Gyllin:\u00a0</strong>3D Environment Artist, Voice Acting.</li><li><strong>Anna Tjernberg:\u00a0</strong>Lead Designer, Game Design, Level Design.</li><li><strong>Christian Forsgren:\u00a0</strong>Lead Artist, Concept Artist, 2D Prop Artist, 2D Environmental Artist.</li><li><strong>Elia Anagrius Stampes:\u00a0</strong>Technical Artist, VFX &amp; Shaders.</li><li><strong>Linn Pennanen:\u00a0</strong>3D Character Artist, 3D Prop Artist.</li><li><strong>Marie Sommerdahl: </strong>Concept Artist, 2D Character Artist, 2D Prop Artist, Voice Acting.</li><li><strong>Nils S\u00f6derman:\u00a0</strong>Animator, Rigger.</li><li><strong>Simon Laserna:\u00a0</strong>Game Design, Scripting.</li><li><strong>Spiros Kessaris:\u00a0</strong>Level Design, Game Design.</li><li><strong>Tobias Nylin:\u00a0</strong>Game Design, Scripting, Music, Sound Design.</li><li><strong>Nick Red:\u00a0</strong>Sound Design.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9dc/9dc2beb3cc49a603a9100569f3ecad19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tobias Nylin", "annatjernberg", "Linnp", "Nils S\u00f6derman", "amsoca"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
