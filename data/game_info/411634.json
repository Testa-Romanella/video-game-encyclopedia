The objective of the game is to expose all cards and move them into the foundation piles. There are 4 foundation piles (one for each suit) that are represented on the screen by an \u201cA\u201d written on it. These piles are built upward in suit from Aces to Kings.<br/><br/>In Solitaire there are 7 tableau columns that are built downward (in decreasing rank from Kings to Aces) in alternating colours (red and black). The aim of the game is to clear all the rows into the suitable foundation piles.<br/><br/>If you enjoy gin rummy, spider solitaire, or other card games, you\u2019ll pick up Klondike solitaire in no time!<br/><br/>Solitaire is a great opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills, relax and have fun!
