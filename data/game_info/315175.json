{"id": 315175, "slug": "golden-galaxy-itch", "name": "Golden Galaxy (itch)", "name_original": "Golden Galaxy (itch)", "description": "<p>Golden Galaxy is a \"Space Invaders\" type of game, in which you are required to defeat waves of enemies and proceed until you reach final boss.</p>\n<p>Your ship is powered by gold (Which comes in satchels and coins) and taking damage will remove one piece of it. This is important because gold can be used to purchase artifacts which will greatly help in figthing enemies. Shops can be found at the end of each stage and randomly throughout the level. And while gold is reset between stages so there is no reason not to buy everything (That is if you can afford it!), shops mid-level will remove your life and make you easier to kill.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 8 unique artifacts, 5 common and 3 rare, each of them with stackable effects (That means getting more than one of the specific artifact will make it even more powerful). Coins and satchels can be obtained from chests and enemies. In addition satchels can generate 1 coin per cleared wave with 33% chance of succeding, but are a lot more rare than coins. Your coins are reset on stage completion (Not satchels though) to specific amount which can be altered by one of the artifacts.</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed this Ludum Dare even if theme was not something I was hoping for and I went for pretty safe implementation of it.</p>\n<p>Some additional tips:</p>\n<p>Always spend all of your coins at the X-10, they are reset next level anyway.<br/>Try to hold on your satchels early on because they generate coins, unless upgrade is really tempting.<br/>Try to get as many upgrades as possible before reaching 5-10</p>\n<p>Arrow keys - Movement<br/>Z - Use/Shoot</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:14:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbc/cbc9ba2abab548e3296e24bae2503c5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jakupf"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
