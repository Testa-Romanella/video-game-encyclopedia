The game challenges the player to rise from the bottom, not forgetting to meet the needs of the character in terms of hunger, vigor and health. At first, you don't have a job, education, social status, or money. Making their way forward, the player builds the future of their character, earning money and respect, buying real estate, cars, and climbing the career ladder.<br/><br/>The game offers 2 ways to earn money, and how to do it is up to you. Do you want to spend your whole life at work, earning like everyone else, or maybe you want to become a real stock magnate, buying cheaper and selling more expensive, finding the most successful moment? Or maybe you have long dreamed of opening your own business and promoting it?<h3>Among the main features of the game:</h3><br/><ul><li> 16 different work activities, ranging from collecting bottles and ending with the main shareholder of a large company<br/></li><li> Daily change in the purchase/sale rate of various items and currencies<br/></li><li> More than 200 different random events, both positive and negative<br/></li><li> Celebrating a character's Birthday with gifts from friends<br/></li><li> 3 ways to earn money<br/></li><li> The maximum age of the character is 80 years<br/></li><li> 24 Steam achievements<br/></li><li> Online leaderboard, where you can see the same businessmen as you, and compete with them on experience</li></ul><br/>We were inspired by a very old similar game that we can't even find on the Internet anymore. It probably existed back in the days of Windows 98 and XP. So the basis of this game is in our project, only with significant changes in the graphic plan, sound, game events, features and current realities.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T21:15:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3db/3db8e24f60d8b7ce1a6266c4f9defd51.jpg", "website": "https://www.wenaystudio.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wenay Studio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wenay Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
