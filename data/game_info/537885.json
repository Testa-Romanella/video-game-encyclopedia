The year is 2020, many years from now. A virus has struck the world, the majority of the global population are to be housebound for the year. <br/>The government, trying to pre-empt the psycological effect this will have on people have contacted YOU. A master of your trade, extreme procrastionation. <br/>They have pleaded that you, a god among mortals, would show the people of the world how to most effectively whittle away the hours whilst keeping your mind stimulated.</em></p>\n<p> I can harbour no blame for any RSIs that occur as a result. Love to all and I wish you a merry Itchmass/new year.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits to the following sounds:</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/cabled_mess/sounds/370962/</p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/ITheRealGooglekatClaire/sounds/500241/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/sounds/441415/<br/></p>\n<p>https://freesound.org/people/waxsocks/sounds/254836/</p>\n<p><strong>And Minimal UI from Unity Asset store\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:30:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eca/eca30fc04d1c9080fd1e4654d696df8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Swift Fox Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
