I started at 10PM\u00a0at Saturday.</p>\n<p>It's really buggy, please have in mind that this is still in active development.</p>\n<p><em>All of the assets were custom hand-crafted just </em><em>for you.</em></p>\n<p>There is no sound nor bg music.</p>\n<p>I didn't add any GWJ wildcards to the title screen, because I had\u00a0no time left.</p>\n<p>For the next jam I guess I will be a bit more prepared.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the texts, I just rushed a lot of\u00a0things in the last 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>A <strong>PROTIP</strong>: There are 4 guns in total - a pistol, an uzi, a sniper riffle and a shotgun. They will be dropped after clearing some waves.</p>\n<p>As @wren noted, for the best experience, please play in fullscreen.<br/></p><p>I used\u00a0warm32 palette.</p><p>Inspired by de_rats map from Counter-Strike 1.6, Monster in my pocket (nes game), and Maple Story.</p>\n<p><strong>ENJOY</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76f/76f0d45623e16e7775cb9fde7215d7ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["edforx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
