We (Falien and Magus) made this game within 72 hours. The theme for LD48 was \"Deeper and Deeper\".</p>\n<p>In this game you are an adventurer returning home just to discover is has been ransacked. You will go explore the old myth of vast riches underground and in the end meet with a gobblin offering new furniture and items to put in your home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We ran out of time to provide more levels/maps to gradually really fill the player home. But we hope you will enjoy our alternate ending anyways. Please leave a comment and vote on our Ludum Dare page, link below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We provided a web-version for easy of testing and a windows stand-alone version for the better quality experience. There is also a world map, but as this includes spoilers we suggest to use it only when necessary.</p>\n<p><em>Enjoy!
