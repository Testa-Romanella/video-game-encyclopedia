Our objective was to create a game that somehow reflects the experience of doing AND playing games.</p>\n<p>In this game, you play two games: (1) a QA testing game, where you find and report bugs, and (2) a game inside the game where somebody crashed his car in the forest.</p>\n<p>To advance the history, you alternate between both characters (the QA tester and the dude in the forest), trying to go as far as possible. Each bug you find and report as a tester will allow you to know more about the story of the car crash victim.<br/></p>\n<p>You can get the project and hack it here :\u00a0https://github.com/joansolroo/mgj18-QA</p>\n<p>Update log:</p>\n<p>10/04/2018: We fixed some visual and control bugs, as people consistently complained about that. It should be less blurry, and you can control the camera with the mouse in FPS. Also, improved the camera rotation speed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/34159b0be6ccf9b6365080f056e02045.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["solroo", "Saltadrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
