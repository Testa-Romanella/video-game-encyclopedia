It's a submission to the spooky VR jam 2020. It's a short zombie shooter like game, in wich you have to kill the evil lemons and only let the good sweets pass through, but beware, the lemons will attack you and the sweets if they get close enough. Your weapons are a katana and a sweets cannon wich, since sweets are the points in this game, shoots your points away.</p><p>PS: The Gameplay is a bit lacking</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation of theme: I live in germany and \"trick or treat\" means \"s\u00fc\u00dfes oder saures\" here. If you translate this back into english by word, not by meaning you get something like \"sweet or sour\". Since I noticed that 2 days into the jam, I stuck to it.</strong></p>\n<p>Rules:</p>\n<ul><li>You get 2 Points for each sweet wich passes you</li><li>You get subtracted 2 points for each sweet you kill</li><li>You can shoot your points. each shot will subtract 1 point</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:11:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a89/a89984f30202d237a2f66f8c1124bb31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucky44"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
