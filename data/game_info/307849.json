The game supports singleplayer as well as multiplayer. Each turn you can move one deer and your opponent can move one hunter. Deer eat the grass on their tile and starve once their tile is bare. While hunters starve if they haven't killed a deer for a certain amount of turns. You can also kill a deer once it is close to starving, so that it can't be killed by a hunter.</p>\r\nSettings\r\n<p>The difficulty slider controls the strategy of the computer oppenent for singleplayer. This varies from semi-random on the left to passive in the middle and aggressive on the right. There are also sliders to control the amount of deer and the amount of\u00a0hunters that are being spawned.
