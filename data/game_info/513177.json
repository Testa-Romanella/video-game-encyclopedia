Go play Poppy and Freya's games (I'm not sure why you're here if you haven't)!<br/><br/>Almost all art created by myself. Exemptions are several seconds from the song \"Dogs\" by Pink Floyd, and the song \"Karkalicious\" by Broadway Karkat. \"Beach Soundscape 3 Sound\" by Mike Koenig was used in the ending.</p><p><strong>Note: The game doesn't close on it's own.
