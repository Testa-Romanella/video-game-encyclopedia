{"id": 565611, "slug": "om-catch", "name": "OM Catch", "name_original": "OM Catch", "description": "<p><strong>Game Shows</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1\u3001Players will be divided into two camps: explorers and guardians.The explorer's goal is to collect the crystal in the map, activate the signal tower to open the gate and escape.The purpose of the guardians is to seal the gates and prevent the explorers from escaping before they can activate the towers\r\n</p>\n<p>2\u3001At the beginning of the game, multiple adventurers and individual guardians will randomly appear in the map. The advantage of adventurers is that there are many of them and they can help each other.The Guardian's advantages are the ability to unlock special building screens, place obstacles in the map, and have a visual advantage\r\n</p>\n<p>3\u3001Explorers have an additional means of winning: collect crystals and use them to board boats in the corner of the map to escape.Note, however, that ships are only for one person, with only one explorer per game. The advantage of escaping the Guardians is that they can unlock special building screens, place obstacles in the map, and have a visual advantage\r\n</p>\n<p>4\u3001Both the explorer and the guardian have the ability to place special props, and the props of the explorer tend to be self-protecting and effective immediately;The Guardian's items tend to attack and delay effect.When the Explorer item is exhausted, it can be replenished at a supply point on the map, while the Guardian item is generated by energy\r\n</p>\n<p>5\u3001\u00a0Energy: The guardian gains a certain amount of energy every second, which can be used to close gates to win the game, or to generate items to block the explorer's movement and delay time.Too much energy allocated to closing the gate will cause the explorer to move too smoothly, and too much energy allocated to generating items will give the explorer more time to escape\r\n</p>\n<p>6\u3001At present, the game is in the demo stage. The tuning and expansion of props and maps will be released in later versions, and more characters and skills will be added in the future\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e122e59846cbeee1d0e97886377bb78c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LunaticToy"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
