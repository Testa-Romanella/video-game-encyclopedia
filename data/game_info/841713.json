Cheaphaven features a brief respite full of farming, building and upgrading, a small town of NPCs for all your chatting and shopping needs, and vaguely humorous descriptions for everyday items. Day/night cycle, market values, sales reputation, a pigeon, all the things that are supposed to be in a farming game.</p>\r\nReal talk\r\n<p>Cheaphaven is a hobbyist solo project, and was made to be \"completable\", so you're probably not going to get 2000 hours of fun out of it, but if you're looking for eight or so hours of relaxed escapism, you're in the right place. If you find bugs or have ideas or thoughts or whatever, drop by the Discord server</p>\r\nDemo\r\n<p>The demo allows you to play for a full in-game week without restrictions. You can keep playing after the demo time ends, but progression won't be possible. Demo save data can be transferred to\u00a0the full release</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/5pu8zKuHe5<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T12:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/18b/18b9dcf87843f7752bc66043aa9ef02a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ComboRoutine"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
