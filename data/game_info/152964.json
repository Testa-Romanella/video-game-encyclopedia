The idea was to build a varient of a sliding puzzle with Populous elements. I didn't get anywhere close to that, but I did get a game goal completed in the 48 hour time limit AND played Axis and Allies with friends while coding. I consider the latter the bigger accomplishment somehow??<br/><br/>This version is very identical with the exception of it being updated to using MonoGame instead of XNA. Linux and Source to come soon! </p><p>From the original readme:</p><p>Flatlands is a puzzle game with an ever changing world! You control a very tiny world (3x3 grid) and can place various tiles on any of the 9 places available to you. But be careful! As you're placing tiles, parts of the world have a tendacy to fall off! Every 5 turns or so, select columns from 1 to all my fall of the edge from the top! To reach the win condition, you're going to have to manically modify your land fast to reach the world state you so desire!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca2/ca2788cb07bcc5ad7f43faf338fd3257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Doc Isaac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
