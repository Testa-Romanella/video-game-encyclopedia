A powerful magic spell holds your nation captive, stirring the population's urges and desires. Will you resist... or give in to your lust? Remain chaste, or drown in crimson tides of promiscuity?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>ToLLA</em></strong> is in active development with a list of <strong>sandbox</strong> features, and more that will be added over time. We're aiming to combine the narrative-rich gameplay of <strong>D&amp;D</strong> games like <em><strong>Baldur's Gate,</strong></em> with fully-illustrated fantasy locations! You like elven waifus? So do we! But all romantic content is completely optional, and the game can be played as a regular party-based <strong>RPG </strong>as well.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from all the <strong>romantic interactions</strong>, you'll also get to enjoy robust <strong>role-playing</strong> opportunities, and pick from many choices that allow you to make your mark on the world! Will you be a courageous crusader? A depraved lecher?\u00a0A foolhardy drunkard? An oppressive tyrant?\u00a0 Or maybe something in between? The choice is always yours... along with the consequences of your actions!</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this is the <strong>SFW</strong> version of the game that's tailored for <strong>general audiences</strong>, and can be played by everyone. It has all the story content as the adult version, but <em>without</em> the lewd scenes and graphic textual descriptions meant for mature players!  For the <strong>adult/18+</strong> version, see the link below:</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This <strong>SFW</strong> version of the game is currently priced at <strong>$0</strong>, which is heavily discounted and will be increased to <strong>$10</strong> with the next content release. The price will go up as more features are added, until it reaches <strong>$15</strong> for the final version. Buying the game at any point gives you access to its future updates for free.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>ToLLA</strong> is being developed by <strong>Crimson Delight Games:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Viximara:</strong> <em>Art, Pre-Vis Concepts, Storyboards, UI, Graphic Design<br/></em></li><li><strong>Frenzin:</strong> <em>Writing, Story Development, PR/Promo, Media Updates<br/></em></li><li><strong>Doozle:</strong> <em>Scripting, System Design, Tech Support, Database Upkeep</em></li><li><strong>Shuky:</strong> <em>Additional Art, Biomes, Doodads, Lewd Lineart, NPC Portraits</em></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Planned &amp; Upcoming Systems/Features:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>sprawling storyline stretching over <strong>3 Acts</strong>, and many locations/biomes\r\n</li><li>visible <strong>armor/outfit destruction</strong> to characters during fights, revealing their features as the battle drags on, and they take more damage!\r\n</li><li>take part in romantic interactions between the <strong>Player Character and most NPCs</strong> (companions, allies, enemies, questgivers, monsters, etc.)\r\n</li><li><strong>numerous races</strong>  the Player can meet and seduce!
