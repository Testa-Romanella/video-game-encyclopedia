On this project I focused heavily on improving my 2D game design and actually finishing a game jam. I love the way my camera controller turned out and I think the game would become a really polished small gem if I had another 6 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There actually is a way to escape however its outside the viewable area as I must have built this project wrong. If you move your player to the top left corner you should be able to see a button you can press and you can complete the game from there. Of course if more time permitted I would fix this bug and expand on the game but hey... we only had 3 hours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Todos:\u00a0<br/>Add UI / Menus<br/>Add sound effects\u00a0<br/>Remove generic (but royalty free)\u00a0low fi music and replace\u00a0<br/>Remove text UI and replace with voice over that is funny\u00a0<br/>Fix my spelling mistakes lol (Luckily not luckly...
