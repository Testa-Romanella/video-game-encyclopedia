Cats love to chase laser pointers and with this version the laser actually reacts when you touch it, encouraging the cat to keep playing.<br/><br/>Place the iPad on the floor in a safe place when the game starts and let your cat play!<br/><br/>To stop the game simply pick up the iPad and shake it to return to the main menu.<br/><br/>This game works especially well on cats that already play with a real laser pointer so are more used to it.<br/><br/>Chasing the spider is great fun for cats too. The spider runs in different directions every time the cat touches it and some cats even try to look under the iPad when the spider runs off screen!<br/><br/>Endless entertainment for your cat!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58a/58a6fd32beb71f773e447d6275011059.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Yesung Moore"], "genres": ["Action", "Family"], "publishers": ["Yesung Moore"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
