Instead, criminals are given excessive sentences, then sent to clear obscure and perilous missions.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This is the first escape room online with role-playing features, we created this game for IGMC 2017, however; not only did we love developing it, we found it to be a lot of fun! The ideas kept flowing and the possibilities are endless, we really hope you enjoy it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>With only 30 days at hand for the contest, this'll come out as a prototype. You have access to the first part of a mission involving the chilling headquarters of the renown\u00a0researcher, Colter Lyman. <em>The mission requires 3 players! we made it easy for you to meet people in the lobby, create and join games.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>The good news is, with your support, during the contest we will complete the entire mission with over an hour of exciting co-op play\u00a0and upload it once we are allowed to edit our submissions, after the contest.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Keep in mind, currently rooms require 3 players and there is no way to reconnect to an existing game. To avoid from causing any re-connection issues we force close the game\u00a0so you can come back, and join a new one safely. We worked very hard to create this game and there are elements that realistically require more time and resources.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>This was one of our greatest challenges and an amazing experience, we'd do it again and again!</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Game Tips</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Communication and coordination is key to surviving the world of Xilkhuun.</li><li>Play with headphones for optimal immersion.</li><li>All nearby participants gain resolve from positive outcomes, the player solving a puzzle through direct action receives a bonus.</li><li>The in-game lobby is a great place to meet people and create teams, can't find anyone?
