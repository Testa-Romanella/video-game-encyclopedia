Looking to make the ultimate party game, we started with a \n      concept that's accessible to the whole family\u2014the popular match-three \n      game. On top of that, we crafted a unique multiplayer experience in \n      which you can choose to work together to complete the challenging levels \n      before the timer runs out or go head-to-head and compete in a frenzy of \n      fun. To top it off, we added 99 uniquely free-flowing levels, the \n      challenging Tiki Pole, 20 hidden tropical sea creatures to unlock, the \n      strategic Fish Net, and last but not least, BOMBS! The result is a \n      family party game like no other. Easy to pick up but impossible to put \n      down. Play alone or with friends, and unleash the Tiki spirit within!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b0/4b03f50a6292ea266a69e7a75ad7f298.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 353, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Reflexive Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
