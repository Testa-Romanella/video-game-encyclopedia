It may sometimes refer to the lower orders of people in general. <br/><br/>I made this game to make you experience ridiculously crowded scenes, feel the despair and noise, and thus bring self-reflection.<br/><br/>There are many different levels where in each level there are 1~3 achievements. Most of the levels are easy to play with, and you can play the next level immediately without even completing any tasks.<br/><br/>As a fan of puzzle games, I set up some puzzle-solving elements in the game. Some of achievements require puzzle-solving skills to achieve.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/542da9d15a5c6f7cccb95e6b9983b2bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 28, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Zhang Fan", "SHEN JIAWEI"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["SHEN JIAWEI"], "esrb_rating": null}
