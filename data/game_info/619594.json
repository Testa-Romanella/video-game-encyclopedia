{"id": 619594, "slug": "mail-bot", "name": "Mail-Bot", "name_original": "Mail-Bot", "description": "<p>Mail-Bot is a 3D physics simulator that focuses on a gravity-defying rope as its central mechanic. Use the Gravity Rope to launch physics objects with mind-boggling gravity as you navigate through the city to your next big delivery!</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the 2021 GMTK Game Jam. With the Jam's theme of \"Joined Together\" I aimed to reflect this in several aspects of the game. The primary gameplay involves the player character being joined with their payload by a rope, the story sees our character uniting a package with its recipient, and the world design is composed of several floating islands joined together by large bridges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made entirely by one person! My name is Jackson and this is my first time ever developing a game and my first time partaking in a game jam. Thank you so much to everyone with GMTK responsible for putting on the event, and thank you to everyone who plays Mail-Bot!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T15:24:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/98d/98d8799473c2c6f72f853d745c64ddc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["diamondnredstone"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
