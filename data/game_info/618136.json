Thus, the ships must cooperate in order to avoid being blown up by mines and torpedos. You can play either alone, taking control of both ships, or try to survive with a friend. The Green ship is controlled with the usual WSAD key set, while the Orange ship uses the arrow keys. It is important to note that both ships can't move backwards and both \"S\" and \"Arrow Down\" keys are useless. The game is infinite, so if one of the ships is fatally damaged, the game restarts.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T09:28:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/879056291850b9132891d332858d9871.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OPTADA", "Dori_me", "min4uk", "In2fractalout"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
