The theme was to recreate the classic\u00a0game \"Centipede\". Clearly, I deviated quite a bit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Mush Rush, you have 45 seconds to \"Collect\" more mushrooms then the centipede invaders.\u00a0With 3 base characters and 1 unlockable one, you'll get MINUTES of excitement out of my weeks\u00a0of labor!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alright, I\u00a0had a blast making this one. I, once again, thought I could make this a roguelike, with shops and upgrades in-between rounds, but had to scrap that. In doing so, the time I\u00a0wasted on that means the second and third enemies are much easier than intended, as they don't have their special abilities. Oh well.\u00a0Things not mentioned in game, I'll put here.</p>\n<p>Getting hit awards the enemy 10 points, while hitting the enemy awards you the same.</p>\n<p>If you lose you won't have to start all over! You'll pick up where you lost.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T21:24:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f40/f407afc1345dabfd927dcd0a9aedd9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["NUTT"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
