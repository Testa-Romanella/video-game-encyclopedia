Or at least attempted to make one in less than 48 hours. Our 48 hours really became 24 hours, because we didn't know the jam started at 6pm GMT instead of PST which was 10am PST. We learned that we should always check the time zone of the game jam we join. I actually really like the potential of this game, so we are for sure finishing our base building mechanics on our own time :). Keep an eye out for Dungeon Defender: Prison Break.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4ef8590562d9daf173a228f24549de6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jeron Artest", "jkorn"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
