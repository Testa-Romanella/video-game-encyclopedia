Escape your vermicomposting life and find a fresher food. The deeper you go the darker it gets? I wanted to focus more on the mood of the game for this one through music. I didn\u2019t get to add as many details as I hoped, but I think its still a pretty rich world. Not a very interactive world in this state though. Hope you find it interesting! I think it could be a fun exploring type game with some more work.\r\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:\r\n</strong></p>\n<p>WASD - Move\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Shift - Move faster\u00a0</p>\n<p>MouseWheel - Adjust Zoom level to see larger portions of the level\u00a0</p>\n<p>Escape - Exit to menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T09:35:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/554/554ff8d289f61d1517998085efb099ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["neonjeff"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
