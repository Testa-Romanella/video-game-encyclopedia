Will\u00a0you be able to overcome the\u00a0mountain filled with obstacles and reach the flag? Only your perseverance will answer this. There's also a timer for all the speedrunners out there (My PB is 9m9s)!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You can play in your browser here (which I suggest since the .exe is very big for some reason), you can download with the link below or use\u00a0this alternate web link:\u00a0https://cannonfoddian.netlify.app/<br/></p>\n<p>Controls are Space to shoot and A and D to turn, also playable with a controller, in which case, A is to shoot and the joystick is to turn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More info:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I'm really proud of this game, especially since it was a unique mechanic and I love foddian games, I was a bit busy so I couldn't use all the 10 days, so there are some parts that are unpolished, but it's a complete game and I'm really happy with the result. also my friend VerreContena made an amazing song in such a short delay, which brings the game to life!</p>\n<p>If you want to play the original non-fixed version (it has missing platforms which makes the game unbeatable), here it is:\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RJ3g_iY1MqMLDkCrWqA6--azbzwT_yLj/view?usp=shari...</p>\n<p>This game was made using my homemade (almost released) JT Engine (engine in he browser for 2d web games):\u00a0https://github.com/ToniestTony/JT-Engine</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T08:56:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d41/d41109ab908538137a70c98bba0086c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tonyz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
