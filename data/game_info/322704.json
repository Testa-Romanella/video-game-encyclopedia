While creature traits exist, and may or may not grant advantages, the player can\u2019t bank everything on traits to have genetically identical parents.\u00a0<br/>If he does reach that point, this bloodline will end here and there.\u00a0<br/>Limited by the physical space that limits movements and by action points, players will need to carefully manage the descendants if they want a sustainable population growth.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-27T04:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/299/299442370d26ae9d4b2d17dc4600f106.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Heritage Hexagonal"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
