{"id": 3181, "slug": "ascendant", "name": "Ascendant", "name_original": "Ascendant", "description": "\"The ancient power struggle between demigods has begun again. The mortal realm will be ravaged in the wake of their desire, their greed, their purpose. I am curious to see who will prevail.\"<br/><br/><strong>Ascendant</strong> is the unforgiving beat 'em up that challenges you with a new world each time you play. It utilizes a number of modern roguelike elements such as permadeath and procedurally generated environments. You are a demigod who invades a plane controlled by your rivals. They will stop at nothing to eliminate you. Only the most impressive warriors will triumph over their armies of zealots and beasts.<br/><br/>By exploring the world, discovering new weapons, spells, and Blessings, and learning how to survive in this brutal realm, you may have a small chance at winning.Features<ul><li><strong>A Brutal Struggle</strong> \u2013 The armies of your demigod rivals are relentless. When a foe cuts you with his sword, it hurts. If you slip into a pit of spikes, the blades leave deep wounds. If a bomb explodes nearby you will burn. Health recovery items are rare. Fight with precision, speed, and timing to survive. Dodge attacks and crush your opponent when he is off-balance to seize the advantage. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Loot the Treasures of the Gods</strong> \u2013 The gods hid their ancient relics in secret caches scattered around the world. Discover unique weapons, spells, and Blessings that grant mighty powers. Double jump, choke your enemies with a poison cloud, or jolt them to ashes with lightning. Equip and customize your Blessings to determine your own fate. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Agile Beat 'em Up Combat</strong> \u2013 Slam enemies into each other to deal massive damage. Pummel enemies with ground and air combos or launch a barrage of spells. Launch your opponents in the air with rapid dashing assaults making them helpless against your divine onslaught.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Death is Final</strong> \u2013 When your enemies defeat you, the game is over. No respawning. No returning to the last save point. You will need all your cunning and skill to win. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>A New World Each Run</strong> \u2013 Each playthrough creates a new hazardous land for adventure. You will never know exactly what you will encounter in the next room, which hazards will be presented to you, what you will find in a chest, or even (in some cases) which boss you will be fighting next. Expect hours of replayability and new challenges.  </li></ul><strong>...And More</strong><ul><li>Two is better than one.
