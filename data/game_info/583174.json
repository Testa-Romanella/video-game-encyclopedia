{"id": 583174, "slug": "adapto", "name": "Adapto", "name_original": "Adapto", "description": "<p>Adapto is a fast-paced survival game where depending on what towers you place,\u00a0 the enemies evolve to counter it. There are three main types of towers: water, fire and steel. Each type of tower can be upgraded once to become more powerful, yet this is more costly, and you can only use so many build points per round.\u00a0Different towers do differing amounts of damage to different enemy types -\u00a0\u00a0if they differ, they are less effective. In this way,\u00a0in order to survive your defence constantly has to be adapting in order to survive against the evolving enemies.</p>\n<p>Controls: Left click to place a tile, right click to remove it. Press space to toggle material, and use the scroll-wheel to toggle between walls and towers.</p>\n<p>Notice: This game had an <em>incredibly </em>rushed development cycle, is wrought with bugs, and is really only a prototype (if that). No time at all was spared for polishing and the UI\u00a0is incredibly rough too.\u00a0We only released it (1 minute before the deadline)\u00a0so that the concept itself can be judged, not the content.</p>\n<p>P.S. Health bars\u00a0don't work on tiles due to a bug in a specific Unity version's UI rendering.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-12T21:49:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97e/97ee7f2698baa641706b6cf96c3419d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["8BitDevelopers"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
