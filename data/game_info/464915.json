More specifically, what you can read on your puny little monitor. It used to belong to one of the janitors here. You have no idea what happened to them, but they're not coming back. You're sure of it.</p><p>As lonely as this all sounds, you do have one remaining solace. The last crew member you can contact. They are doing everything they can to keep the vessel running.

Maybe they don't want your guidance after all.</p><p>At least they know you're here. That's more than you were expecting.</p><p>This vessel is going down. It's inevitable.
