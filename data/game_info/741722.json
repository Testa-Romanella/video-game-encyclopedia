Sprites, environments, and battles will be visually more appealing, and the rest\u2026 will pretty much stick to the basics. 8 new episodes tell the complete tale of Fragile Hearts 2.</p>\n<p>Plot<br />\nWhen an angel and a demon have inappropriate relations with one another, the truce between heaven and hell is broken and an evil god is summoned upon the world of the mortals. Meanwhile, a hegemonic federation has surfaced and has banned the use of magic throughout the world. Our heroes from the previous game may be the only ones able to stop these horrible injustices from happening! Unfortunately, they\u2019ve retired and are unwilling to help.</p>\n<p>Join a new batch of zany characters as they combine forces to overthrow the meddling federation and destroy the evil war god. You\u2019ll also meet many new and peculiar characters along the way, such as Kozoh, a defective robot that steals shit; Yaga, an unsuccessful prostitute; Palmer, a talking dog (and Gulliver\u2019s rival); and Oggy, a citizen of the walking dead persuasion.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T04:08:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2df/2dfd75fae1de7c7d130a819ce2ebaf57.jpg", "website": "https://rpgmaker.net/games/3396/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 190, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
