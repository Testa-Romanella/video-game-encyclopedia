It was made using the\u00a0Godot Engine and a couple of free assets.</p>\n\n<p>You control the character by using WASD to move, while you aim the weapon's direction\u00a0with the mouse. Your sword has two different attacks with LMB and RMB.</p>\n\n<p>The level is simple: You're in a dungeon where you have to find a key that opens the passage to the Boss, which currently is the only enemy. After defeating it, the exit door opens and the game ends when you enter it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:39:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae95e787dcc16dcfc2122efce80d676.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Razer Jegue"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
