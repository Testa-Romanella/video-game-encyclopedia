Three artists and three programmers working together over the course of seven weeks in conceptualizing, prototyping and then finally developing it into what we've released here. </p>\n<p>This wasn't just an assessment to us though, we also saw it as a passion project inspired by games that we all love and ideas we all wanted to see realised.</p>\n<p>The ending is unfortunately missing, but hopefully we'll be able to put it in at some point in the future! A majority of the content is still there, so we hope you enjoy that!<br/></p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Artists!<br/>https://lunequinox.itch.io/</p>\n<p>https://noodlebaguette.itch.io/</p>\n<p>https://12345678234873687.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Programmers!<br/>https://arisock.itch.io/</p>\n<p>https://breadifiedtoast.itch.io</p>\n<p>https://truepastelpink.itch.io/<br/></p>\n\n<p>\u2727</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T21:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95f5c2a0675e69d635ada27f52b2617.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["123.4567.823.4873687", "NoodleBaguette", "lunequinox", "TruePastelPink", "AriSock", "BreadifiedToast"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
