In this new take on the classic tower defense style game, you take on the role of <strong>Danny</strong>: <br/>A down on his luck fella who gets involved in a local gang when a much needed promise of fast cash arises. <br/><br/>The \"towers\" are your crew members, each of which will have a unique weapons and upgrade options. Place your crew members strategically around the paths in front of your stash houses to maximize their efficiency against the waves of enemies that seek to thwart you.<br/><br/><br/>There are 4 main fractions to defend your warehouse against and ultimately defeat:<br/><br/>1) <strong>THE THUGSZ</strong><br/><br/>A smaller local gang that more than makes up for its size in relentlessness <br/>However, without a warehouse to manufactor product, they eagerly resort to<br/>taking it from whomever has a stash lying about. Molly gets her name from her favorite cocktail:<br/>The Molotov Cocktail<br/><br/>2) <strong>THE STEFAN CARTEL</strong><br/><br/>A well financed, even better dressed, covert outfit that blends in with everyday business men <br/>and women. They control a large piece of the drug market with futuristic weaponry which is <br/>maintained by the crew and in no way thanks to Stefan himself, who inherited the cartel <br/>from his father before naming it after himself shortly after<br/><br/>Stefan would describe himself as a highly sophisticated, highly admired, highly dangerous <br/>individual who can neutralize a man from 1000 miles away, but nothing <br/>comes even close to his skills as a lover <br/><br/>3) <strong>THE BUTCHER</strong> <br/><br/>the Butcher: a massive and scary fellow who deals in meat and chemicals (the iillegal kind) <br/>his gang is comprised of ruthless, violent, chemistry-huffing, lunatic lab workers.<br/>When they\u2019re not creating deadly new drugs they\u2019re attacking other cartels using<br/>unconventional methods.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, do NOT mention his freakishly small head...<br/><br/>4) <strong>THE DEA</strong><br/><br/>\"With endless backing and endless funding the Drug Enforcement <br/>Army has a lot of options for Chief Boyd to choose from when <br/>hunting down pesky criminal organisations, making him and his army <br/>a tough customer for any criminal organisation to deal with, <br/>especially those who have an aversion to most armored vehicles and rocketry<br/>on their private property\"<br/><br/>As you prove your stash house protection capabilities against rival gangs and the DEA, you advance in rank. Higher rank means more responsibility and bigger stash houses with more to protect and more cash on hand. But with more to loose comes more unwanted attention! Upgrade your towers, turrets and use your drone to defeat your rivals and take over!<br/><br/><br/>Ad the game to your wish list today and stay tuned for more exciting info, pics and videos about The Outsider TD", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-08T06:58:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff6/ff607992d0585847d8ffe2d0097b8c0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 271, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jesper Petersen"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SKT Gaming / Jesper Petersen"], "esrb_rating": null}
