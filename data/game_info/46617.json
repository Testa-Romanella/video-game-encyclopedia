But there's a catch - once you pick up an object, you need to move it constantly because if you stop the object will drop and fall and therefore your level progress will be lost. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are also some special areas in the game:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nRED AREA - red area is a killer area and your level is lost automatically if you move an object here<br/>\r\nBLUE AREA - blue areas are no-play areas, meaning that you can not move objects onto them<br/>\r\nPINK AREA - pink areas are areas of low gravity<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlan your moves, keep your head clear and collect all the stars to create your goals and reach them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c3/2c3058d7abc296862fd83f403ec59f50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broadplay Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
