I have been in Game Design as a Hobby for over a decade. I was part of the MechWarrior: Living Legends team (Wander Samurai Studio) which won some Awards and inspired MechWarrior: Online but that was a long while ago.  I have wanted to go Professional since I first got into Game Design but Life always seems to have other plans and I admit, I am attached to my family. So what to do? Make Games like this is what to do!<br/><br/>I remodeled for a long while for income, but it just doesn't satisfy me like getting a new feature working correctly. I had little Hobby Game Projects, but those never went anywhere, nor did I expect them to; they were usually aimed toward getting better at, or learning a new skill; It was all 3d work in CryEngine though, so moving to 2d is a change that I'm loving!<br/><br/>I officially started working on Grid Creeps February 2019, but preliminary work began about a year before that. I knew I wanted to get into Indie development, so before starting Production I was trying out all manner of smaller scale games and doing a lot of research. The idea was to find a Game I wanted to Play and couldn\u2019t because it didn\u2019t exist, at least that was the main criteria. When that Hunt concluded, Grid Creeps was born. Now, more than half a year later I treat this as a full time Job and am still as Passionate about this project as when I started it, I love working on it and I love playing it. I\u2019m excited to hear feedback from the Community and see the Bases and Strategies that everyone comes up with! I may not reply a lot, I am Juggling a lot of stuff, it's a bit overwhelming at times! but I read all feedback and I hope the updates themselves show it. <br/><br/>Thank you for your interest in Grid Creeps!", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T03:32:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c8/6c8f563747c2f80936fdc9f680da88f7.jpg", "website": "http://www.gridcreeps.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 254, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dustin Bledsoe"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dustin Bledsoe"], "esrb_rating": null}
