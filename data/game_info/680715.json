A traitor unveiled, the streets are filled with joyous cries, but here in your cell, there's nothing but fear and regret. Imprisoned for . . . various reasons, you play as an <strong>ex-executioner</strong> who's up for execution yourself. The clock is ticking and your dreams are damning. Will you face your <strong>guilt</strong> or drown in it? The choice is yours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: This game contains gore, disturbing imagery, loud sounds, and deals with sensitive topics. There are no intentional jumpscares but some scenes may be surprising. There are two endings, but it is not necessary to get both to \"complete\" the game.</p>\n<p>Since this is our first game, there may be bugs (none of which should affect the gameplay). We will be updating the game regularly to fix them. Although they shouldn't, some fixes may erase your progress, so be aware when redownloading. For now, please wait for the textboxes to finish before continuing dialogue, otherwise the game may crash. If the game crashes, please exit out, load again, and you should start at the nearest checkpoint. MacOS compatibility coming soon!</p>\n<p>This game has a built in save system, so you do not need to manually save.</p>\n<p>If you are having any issues please contact us at <em>mediocrephilosophie@gmail.com</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow Us!</strong></p>\n<p>Instagram:\u00a0@an_emo_inchworm\u00a0or @mathgonewrong</p>\n<p>Twitter: @an_emo_inchworm</p>\n\n<p>Sound effects obtained from:\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>Sound effects obtained from: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:40:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e9/7e94bc7c05d70adf298e6610633051ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 105, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Wrong Worm"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
