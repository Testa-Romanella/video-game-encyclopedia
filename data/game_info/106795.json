The design of the game follows the patterns created by the Runner's genre, and thus the mechanics are simple and based on a character that moves between two lanes. The player must avoid all the collisions with the incoming traffic and at the same time picking up all the coins possible, if the player reaches the finish lane before the time runs out, he wins.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/57b/57b3dbbd34a15706a0abba17acee29dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 108, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Hako"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
