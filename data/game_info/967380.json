Use your superhuman abilities to pull objects and launch them at high speeds to massacre enemies in a frantic bloody romp. But remember to always keep moving; if you stop, you die.<br/><br/>In the future, sprawling cityscapes cover the planet and AI is everywhere. One rogue AI is hell-bent on destroying its creators and has swept you up in its plans. You may be a controlled cog in its machine but you\u2019re one very destructive super-powered cog.<br/><br/>Inspired by Doom, Portal, and Mirror\u2019s Edge, STOP DEAD blends speed, action, and carnage into a beautiful comic book-inspired cacophony of chaos and fun.<br/><br/><strong>Game Features:</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Guns are effective, but why stop there?
