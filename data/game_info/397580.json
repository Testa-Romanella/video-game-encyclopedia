Now you can finally simulate pressing a large, circular button from the comfort of your own home. Watch as the button is magically pressed as you press the space-bar on your real keyboard!</p>\n\n<p>DISCLAIMER 1:</p>\n<p>This game is not meant to be taken seriously, only as a silly waste of time, space and effort. This is also my first game and more of a way to learn C++. SDL and Itch.io than an actual game, it is most likely terribly made and amateurish in nature. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the button in all its glory.</p><p>Disclaimer 2:</p><p>Windows Defender will try to stop the game from running. If this occurs, simply press\u00a0<em>\"more info\"</em> when in that screen and you should be able to run the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/235/235768171ee6957081511dfbbd07b4f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frogg Dev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
