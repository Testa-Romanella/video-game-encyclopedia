They must go through a series of challenges and mini-games to successfully transmit these messages to sustain their relationships. If they fail at any of the mini-games, the messages will be distorted and they may not correctly communicate what they intend to tell their new friends.</p>\n<p>Complex.net is a 2D\u00a0adventure game with point-and-click elements. There are many mini-games included ranging from quick time events to puzzles, and even some learning Japanese!</p>\n<p>This project was created for Global Game Jam 2018 (meaning we created it in under 48 hours). The entire game and all of its artwork was created in a single weekend by Steve Rakar and Michelle Rakar.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>1/28/2018 @ 8PM\u00a0Update: Fixed some bugs so now you can play through Zandra's mini-game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c17c3d10479df0040c751b81294998ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michelle Rakar", "The Gek Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
