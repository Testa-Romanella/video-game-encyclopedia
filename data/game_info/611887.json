There, they find two mountains about the same height. They split and decide to compete on who gets to the top of their mountain of choice first. But, at the feet of the two mountains, the players realize that the mountains are somehow mechanically intertwined.</p>\n<p>The game is full of challenging fast-paced platform levels with puzzles for two players. Every level has to be completed with two players that share similar platform gameplay.</p><p><strong>Some clarifications before listening:</strong></p><p>- The piano and \"video game\" synth represents each one of the mountaineers;</p><p>- If youre interested, the recurring motif is D - C - B - A;<br/></p><p>- I recommend listening at a high volume (but don't blow your ears up plz xD).</p><p><strong>Tracks descriptions:</strong><br/></p><p>- <strong>Duality</strong>: This song is the overture of the album. This can be the trailer song or played at the very beginning.</p><p>- <strong>Dangerous Puzzles</strong>: This song is an example for level songs. It is how the overall musical atmosphere should sound like. (track can be looped)<br/></p><p>- <strong>Too High</strong>: The mountaineers encounter a very difficult challenge, but they persist through it. (track can be looped)</p><p>- <strong>Last </strong><strong>Stretch</strong>: The players arrived to the last levels of the game. (track can be looped)<br/></p><p>- <strong>At The Top</strong>: Pretty self-explanatory. They arrive at the top of the mountains.</p><p>Good luck to all enrtys!! &lt;3<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T05:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/420/42021a9dc95c00984dceac372ba0c18b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Felipe Peticov"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
