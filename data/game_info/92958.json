After he returned to the Dream Islands and was celebrated as a great hero, he since lived happily at his master's place, the wise wizard who teached him being a good magician as time passed.<br/> <br/> Now the Dream Islands - there, all animals live together peacefully - are in danger. And what Tom doesn't know yet is that he himself is conjuring up this danger by mistake! More about this you will get to know in the intro... But one thing is for sure: The Dream Islands will be pushed into chaos and the only one who can save them is our little Tom!<br/> <br/> It's Magic 1 was already nice, but It's Magic 2 tops it by all means and is on its way to become a true C64 classic amongst the jump'n runs. In the picturesque intro you are introduced to the background of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4e/a4eee031439c270317cccb29f27a263e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Protovision"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
