This meant that spatial recognition and being able to tell where sounds were coming from would be very important. My first attempt was to completely sidestep the in-built Unity or GVR spatial audio technology, using nothing but audio stereo pan and volume to determine \"hits.\" I switched over to working in 3D and using GVR spatial audio to give the player a greater sense of aiming and moving through space.</p>\n<p>LESSONS LEARNED</p>\n<p> Despite using GoogleVR (GVR) spatial audio, I found that having too many sounds coming from the same general area (in front of the player) made fine predictions of enemy locations difficult to make. GVR also did not allow me to use Unity's audio mixer features. For example, I wanted to use Duck Volume to lower music volume while important player-related SFX were playing. Since this didn't seem possible to do with GVR, I unfortunately had to remove music from all parts of the game except the very end for the sake of gameplay.</p>\n<p> After this design exercise, it became apparent to me that in an audio-only game, clarity comes first. Sounds should be simple and not fatiguing (admittedly, many of the sounds I used in Boom Bike are fatiguing). Sound cues should be very distinct from one another. If different SFX are too similar, and come from the same general direction, they can blend together into a murky mess. Music, while certainly great to have, should not drown out the sounds of the game, especially if one's audio-only game requires movement in 3D space. Furthermore, audio sources that are drones and loops can be very hard to pinpoint using GVR. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["paosalcedo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
