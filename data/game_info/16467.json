They are Otto, Axel, and Hans, who have decided to go on a journey to the center of the Earth. The main problem is that if the player chooses to move forward individually, the others can&#39;t go any further. So the three characters need to work together to avoid the vicious spike traps reminiscent of the old Prince of Persia, solve puzzles and survive through dangers. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay is classic: there are no battles and no enemies, the player should make his way through 18 levels. It requires solving puzzles through the use of buttons and ladders, avoiding traps, getting past every level&#39;s obstacles, and escaping various traps along the way. Every character has a unique skill: Otto can use a pickaxe to destroy stones, Axel can jump higher, and Hans can hold water in his flask - this is quite an important skill as the characters can die of thirst. It offers difficult puzzle challenges which get harder over time and ordinary gameplay length. The game has special sounds and music which repeat throughout the gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": 65, "released": "2003-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:22:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b6/4b607ca785758e5e26041b3d2f6c4752.jpg", "website": "http://www.insayn.net/", "rating": 1.89, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 41, "owned": 1042, "beaten": 12, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 11}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 46, "suggestions_count": 545, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 46, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Frogwares", "4Nation5", "insayn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Frogwares", "insayn"], "esrb_rating": null}
