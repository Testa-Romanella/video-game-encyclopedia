Mine gold by bouncing balls into gold bricks. Use the gold to buy new Nodes with different effects. But watch out for the ever increasing Voids, hidden in the Fog. Find them and launch balls into them until they shrink into nothing!<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>We've got a lot of controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Left Mouse: Selects and Rotates. Places Nodes. Can be fidgety.</p>\n<p>Right Mouse: Refunds Nodes. You can refund any Node currently.</p>\n<p>Wheel Mouse Scroll: Zoom</p>\n<p>Wheel Mouse Drag / Right Ctrl + Left Mouse Drag: Pan Camera</p>\n<p>Escape: Pause Menu</p>\n<p>P: Palette Change</p>\n<p>E / R: Rotate Selected Object +/- 45 degrees</p>\n<p>C: Focus Camera on Main Node</p>\n<p>T: Toggle Inventory Menu</p>\n\n<p><strong>We have a lot of options:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Don't get overwhelmed! Just use one of the many presets and have fun. If you find a setting that you like or are tweaking frequently, please let me know! We are very VERY early access right now, and these settings are a way to find better balance and game feel. Currently, they do not save, but they will soon. Here is the full list with more detailed descriptions:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Gold Brick Amount: The \"hitpoints\" of each gold brick.\u00a0They will go away after this many hits.\u00a0</li><li>Scale Down on Hit: How much the gold bricks shrink per hit</li><li>Void HP</li><li>Void HP Increase Rate: Time in seconds between each HP increase</li><li>Void HP Increase Amount: How much\u00a0HP per tick (above)</li><li>Void Lose HP: At which point is a Void defeated? I found that 0 took way too long and the Void was too small to hit. 150 is default now.</li><li>Void Win HP: At which point does that player lose?</li><li>Number of Voids: Game is much more fun with 3!</li><li>Starting Gold</li><li>Gold Per Fog: How much gold per fog elimination</li><li>Price Repeater\u00a0</li><li>Price Redirector</li><li>Price Wall</li><li>Price Splitter Mirror</li><li>Price Splitter 90</li><li>Price Splitter Truplicate</li><li>Price Scaler</li><li>Price Piercer</li><li>Price Debug - Price of the debug buttons (Gold / Void)</li><li>Repeater Uses - There is a limited amount of uses on some nodes. Right now, it is really high (500), but this is where you control it</li><li>Splitter Nodes Uses - Same thing, but for Splitters</li><li>Repeater Shooting Time - Time between ball spawns from the Repeater</li><li>Other Shooting Time - All others</li><li>Scale\u00a0Node\u00a0Amount - How much does the Scaler scale things up?</li><li>Rows</li><li>Cols</li><li>Wall Frequency - For random map gen, how frequent are Walls</li><li>Gold Brick Frequency - Same as above, for Gold Bricks</li><li>Splitter Frequency - Currently only randomly places Redirectors. I found this to be kinda pointless, but left it in</li><li>DBG No Fog - Toggles Fog</li><li>DBG Dont Show Texts for Uses - Showing the uses on some nodes really clutters the interface, but it's also helpful info</li><li>DBG Show Debug Buttons - You aren't supposed to be able to place Gold Bricks or Voids, but this setting allows you to</li></ul>\n<p>Many of these will probably make it into the final game. Please let me know if you would like any more settings exposed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:19:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21a/21ac4790c9370b33e1b47c78725fbdf6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["snarge"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
