{"id": 387758, "slug": "farmer-joe", "name": "Farmer Joe", "name_original": "Farmer Joe", "description": "<p>This is the exciting life of Farmer Joe. At first you're in his room, \u00a0getting the feel for how he lives. There's clothes all on the ground and not many decoration. Once you go outside, you will either be in the garden, front yard or at his farm. He has many vegetables to pick up, animals to feed and a few flowers blossoming. In the front yard you have the option to take his car to the market where he can buy some clothes, food, tools or items for his animals. It's just a simple, everyday routine for Farmer Joe and now you too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided that with certain words I wanted to make them look different. For example - When it says \"iCarly\" it's in rainbow. This was because it's not something you would think a farmer would watch, but it's funny, so effect. With my transitions, I didn't want them all to be the same, I wanted it so you knew that you were going to a different place. \u00a0So, Farmer Joe is basically living like an old man, but he has an exception for iCarly, which is why he has a TV. He grows his own food - plants and animals. Goes to a market and buys things that local people are selling. It's really like a dude from the 60s, 70s came into the 2000s and started to make a living.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T05:03:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48475f01e856ed70e3eed76a21600af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["klipham76"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
