What do those young whippersnappers know about anything?!! Back in our day we scootered 50 miles to school one-way!!! We survived the war gosh-darn it (well our parents not us).   \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>We need to do our shopping and with our old age we are not sprinting round the shops no more. We\u2019re taking the scooter gosh darn it and we will complete our shopping and about time too as we are out of alcohol.   \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Let\u2019s try not to hit anyone though as we do not want to pay their insurance costs. Also, any damage to the store will have to be covered. So, get in there and get our shopping. And pronto!! I need to crack open a nice cold one. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Movement \u2013 W, A, S, D (Well until the throttle sticks)\r\n    </p>\n<p>Tab \u2013 Open shopping list (Menu \u2013 lets you return to main menu, shows score)\r\n    </p>\n<p>'Reverse' levels means reserved scoring\u00a0 so try to damage as much as  possible. Therefore, if you want to smash into everything to get stars  then run the 'Reverse' levels. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits\r\n  </strong><br/></p>\n<p>Programming, level design / lighting and general Unity Expert - Tom 'Tommo120' Fox\r\n      </p>\n<p>Programming, level design, and sound effects / music - Matt 'Mista Giggles' Shepherd\r\n      </p>\n<p>Programming, level design and 3D 'Art' - Ian 'Surfa' Beecraft\r\n    </p>\n<p>Some Kenny assets and free asset store assets used as we realized we  didn't have time to model everything ourselves and get the features we  wanted in. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Linux\r\n  </strong></p>\n<p>Requires Mono runtime to run on Linux.
