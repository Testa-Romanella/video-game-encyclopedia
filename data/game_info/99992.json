It is your duty to deliver your goods as fast as you can and in one piece.<br/></p>\n<p>Using your limited \u00a0power you must juggle between powering your engines, creating ammo, building up your shield, repairing your ship and attacking incoming enemies who want to get their hands on your precious cargo.</p>\n<p>Drag power around to systems with left mouse button.<br/>Hold H to show the annotation of the systems.<br/>Press F to toggle fullscreen.</p>\n<p>This was made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 39 - Running Out Of Power. I had to start a day late so I'm only entering it in the Jam.<br/></p>\n<p>There are a number of systems that go cut due to the short timeframe. I had planned a whole system of selling your goods to unlock and upgrade your ship, you could catch debris flying past with your net, you would have to keep goods frozen or locked up with power, open your door to dock with stations to deliver the cargo, etc.</p>\n<p>My favourite part of the game is the system of creating ammo then launching it by powering and depowering the net and the way I planned to also have it collect debris.</p>\n<p>I'm going to try to get an HTML5 version running but initial signs didn't look promising.</p>\n<p>Thanks for taking an interest in my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e3/7e341174f7cc8df2a6008618055afe90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["reBTF"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
