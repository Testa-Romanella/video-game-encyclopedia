{"id": 94441, "slug": "swan-hill", "name": "Swan Hill", "name_original": "Swan Hill", "description": "<p>Swan Hill is a short choose-your-own-adventure Twine story. It is about two brothers who have grown to see their world in very different ways. It has a minimalistic presentation style and a unique color-based link system.</p><p>It was released on my website in 2013.</p>Play Swan Hill online here.<p>This download contains the local version of the game, as well as the game's cover image and the .tws source file, from which you are free to cannibalize any code you wish. This source file can only be opened in the \"old\" version of Twine, 1.4.2.</p><p>I am posting this on itch.io because I have been contacted several times by people who want to use Swan Hill's color-based link system in their own games. It is actually extremely simple. You can find the CSS that controls the link colors by examining <em>the final block of text</em> in the stylesheet node of this game's .tws file.</p><p>I am currently working on <strong>a sequel to Swan Hill</strong> that I plan on re-releasing with Swan Hill and other short hypertext stories. You can play the demo for that sequel here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4ecdca3b8c4e8000dccdc09d6335c1a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Laura Michet"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
