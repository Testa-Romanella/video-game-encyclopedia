I've polished it up somewhat since then,\u00a0removing the more egregious of the typos and bugs, adding some sound effects -\u00a0lots of little things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a relatively short text-based adventure game, revolving around exploring a mansion - as well as fighting a god or two.</p>\n<p>There're some (admittedly somewhat surface level) similarities between this game and the plot of\u00a0the third issue of Neil Gaiman's <em>Sandman </em>series,\u00a0<em>Dream a Little Dream of Me</em>. There's no deep meaning for this - I was reading the Sandman at the time, and thought it was a good issue. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, or so \"they\" say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>User instruction can be found in the readme file. If you have questions that can't be answered there, feel free to leave a comment on the itch page.</p>\n<p>Not much more to say here, except thanks for stopping by, and\u00a0I hope you enjoy my game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T12:31:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22e/22e9d3272f0ed8156a2a78c7db6cdd85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcus"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
