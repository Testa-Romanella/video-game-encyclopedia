Throughout the game, you will fight off attacking enemies, collect experience and level up.<br/>You will then have to plant your roots into the ground (by pressing the R Key) when the experience bar has reached its maximum limit, this is shown at the top of the screen and indicated by a lightning charge. When rooted, you gain access to a talent tree, which then shows you new weapons to unlock or upgrades for current weapons. You can also gather coins, which can be spent to buy new characters with different play styles in the main menu under the \"Unlocks\" tab, and plant sacks that can heal you.</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy playing <em>The Host</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T17:42:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dfd/dfdc0dbd77d1e5fd785b026525d4090f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gregamo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
