Audio is recommended, but don't set your volume too loud.</p>\n<p>On a recent exploratory mission, you have delved too deep into an uncharted region. An emergency portal has been deployed nearby, along with several locator beacons. The locator beacons, although inaccurate, will point you in the direction of the portal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Search the procedural\u00a0dark world using\u00a0 sonar-like pulses to see the environment. You can only carry 3 large non-directional pulses. Find refill crates to replenish them.<br/>Now be careful in your search. There have been reports of dangerous, sound sensitive entities lurking in the darkness.<br/></p>\n<p>Enter the portal to be transported to a new region, which will hopefully be safer than the last...</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>- The level\u00a0will take some time to generate. This happens when you press play and when you enter a portal.<br/>- When you are close to the portal, the ambient colour\u00a0will change.<br/>- The portal looks like a perfect circle.<br/>- If you get stuck in terrain\u00a0when you spawn, press [L] to regenerate the region.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or major issues with the game, please leave a comment!</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>I have made this game prototype available for free with the option to donate. You do not need to pay to play this game.\u00a0Only donate if you want me to develop this project further\u00a0or if you want to support me. <br/>I appreciate you playing the game regardless :)</p>\n<p>-------</p>\n<p>Project developed in 2 weeks.\u00a0<br/>Some of its development was\u00a0streamed live at\u00a0twitch.tv/jamesbbarrow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T13:02:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/001/001c938386f424c3c2f8b466756cc15e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James B Barrow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
