You play as a thief searching for something that can make you rich, but you might end up finding a friend instead! Or you could avoid friendship and just steal stuff if that's what you like. The theme of the jam was \"free\", and the game is about a girl who has been trapped in her room for a few thousand years. In the finished game, you will be able to free her if you make the right choices. <br/></p>\n<p>Gameplay is only about 10 minutes, since I used my time to learn Ren'py, write a script, design and draw sprites for two characters. So far you can only achieve 1 ending, though there are at least 3 planned.<br/></p>\n<p>(You may have to turn up the volume in the options menu. I set it to mute and forgot about it.)</p><p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>GUI is from https://scribbles.itch.io/lunar-magic <br/>Music is from\u00a0https://pocket-se.info/ <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:39:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f96/f966bbba4a0f57471d1e837f7b0f4387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chicha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
