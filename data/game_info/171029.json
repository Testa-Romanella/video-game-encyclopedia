It has a two-player mode along with a couple of power-ups, including a spread-shot. There is also a local high-score list! This was created with GameMaker Studio 2.<br/></p><p>The BGM music is \"A Night of Dizzy Spells\" by Eric Skiff.</p><p>Sound effects created with Bfxr.</p><p>All other assets created by me.<br/><br/>Change log<br/>Build 1.1.0<br/>- fixed the local scoreboard so now it <em>doesn't </em>reset after you restart the game. Compared to the last build, it also stores that info even if you close the application. ** You can reset the scoreboard by pressing BACKSPACE in the pause screen. This action will also restart the game.<br/>- added the ability for players to resize their window! It will maintain aspect ratio, and IMO the image quality is still good.<br/>- fixed a typo in the P2 instructions.</p><p>Build 1.1.1<br/>- fixed another typo in P1 instructions<br/>- added a white border in in the room so when players resize the window, there is no confusion on where the edge of the room is.<br/>- also changed the file icon so it looks cool :)</p><p>Build 1.2<br/>- improved text input at the game over screen</p><p>Build 2.0<br/>- This will be the final build of the game! Unless I am receiving a considerable amount of tips, I will no longer update the game unless they are bug fixes.<br/>- added a menu system and the option to change player sprites<br/>- added instructions<br/>- added a new power-up, the shield! a player who picks it up will be invulnerable for 10 seconds and will destroy asteroids that they collide with.<br/>- added a special attack! small asteroids will have a chance to drop orbs, which will fill up a special meter that is under the score in the top-left. once filled, players will receive a charge that they can use to do a special attack! this new feature is intended to help players survive a bit longer, possibly even going on infinitely? who knows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da5/da5c1dcd26e469d9bdb18dadc42a2335.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["judiethai"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
