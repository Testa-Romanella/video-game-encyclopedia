If the lime falls in to red, orange and yellow holes, the player will drink. The blue holes are safe, aim for those.<br/></p>\n<p>The player can move the lime pressing right and left arrow keys and throw it pressing and releasing the space key. Keep the sound on during play.</p>\n<p>Have fun and drink responsibly.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/2404e9294d6e85d976ac4d0347f8dc10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Su K\u0131z\u0131la\u011fa\u00e7"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
