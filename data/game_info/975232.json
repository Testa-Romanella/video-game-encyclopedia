Since Enter Sangbian Island a rather heavy mission and identification of the cause, the duel was somewhat unreasonable.<br/>\r\n\u201cExcept for the god of the sea, everything was fine in its own way.\u201d<br/>\r\n\"Shinjike gave me a sense of being elegant and lonely somewhere, and Hae-gwi seemed like a gentle man with strong strength in a rough battlefield.\"<br/>\r\n\u201cOf course, both of you are trustworthy.\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cBut how to help... I can't help but feel anxious because I don't know what will happen if I go to Sangbian Island...\u201d<br/>\r\nThen, in a daze, I looked towards the shore from inside the shrine. Under the deep blue sky, the moon was shining brightly, and the seawater reflected the moonlight softly.<br/>\r\n\u201cThere is a moon as big as that in this place... I like it because it is moderately bright and not dazzling.\u201d<br/>\r\nThe tremendous tension and anxiety before the big event calmed down little by little while watching the moon and listening to the sound of the sea.<br/>\r\nHyeyoon also fainted and got up. The shrine where Hyeyoon is located is deeper inland than Yeonseul's shrine, so the seawater is not visible. There is only a thin stream.<br/>\r\n\u201cImoogi..? pal?\"<br/>\r\nI was still in the temple, dazed and dazed, as if it was still sudden.<br/>\r\nAfter a daze, I came out of the shrine and looked at the moon.<br/>\r\nThe soft moonlight and the sounds of insects and streams seemed to calm Hyeyoon's heart.<br/>\r\n\"Shinjike-nim... Hae-gwi-nim...\"<br/>\r\n\u201cAm I the right person for the job\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br/>\r\nHye-yoon lacks confidence. But someday someone has to do it. Besides, there are colleagues who will come together.<br/>\r\n\"okay. There was also Yeon-seul... Would you think that the grace I received was repaid with help? I'm glad I don't get sick...\u201d<br/>\r\nIt was as if the various environments around her were comforting and encouraging Hyeyoon, who thought of herself as weak. I can't help but feel anxious...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow to play the game<br/>\r\n1. Common Mode<br/>\r\nAvoid and shoot down the attacks of various henchmen that appear for a certain amount of time whenever you enter each chapter!<br/>\r\nAfter a certain amount of time, the boss comes out, talks to the player, and starts a duel with the player.<br/>\r\nBeat the boss to enter the next chapter or view the endings!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n2.
