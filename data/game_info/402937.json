I will make a better trailer eventually.<br/></p>\n<p>This is mostly a test to see if the game is worth putting on steam or not. Since certain things need testing I was worried about a steam release. I shouldn't trust myself with that testing since I have a major bias. I just want to make the game better than what it is already. I might make some changes or add new levels later on. I might add some bonus levels as well to make the game have more content. I would highly recommend some feedback so I can make some last minute changes and edits to make the game better overall.<br/></p>\n<p>I should warn players that near the end there is a level that might be considered eye gore. I don't think most people will get to that point for a bit but just a heads up. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-06T03:13:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e646638d1af2c2078290be47fca171df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evilous"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
