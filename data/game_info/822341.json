I joined the jam last day and sadly I didn't have enough time.\u00a0I was planning to add more defense towers and zombie kinds and even make my own music for the game but I couldn't prepare it in time. But\u00a0 I believe the game even in it's starter form pretty enjoyable. It brings a twist to previous well known 2d shooters, base building! The base building system adds strategy to the game as well as some variety. In my game you can freeze down enemies with the traps you set around and with enough money, you can blow up zombies with guided fireworks. The game starts out playable but as time progresses the game gets harder and harder. There isn't an actual ending to the game so go as far as you can.\u00a0It's the morning by the time I'm uploading this, Hope you like it! I'm open to any feedback! All the SFX, sprites, art and code are by me (made in one day). The music I used is royalty-free.</p>\n<p>Instructions<br/>Click on the weird boxes\u00a0 to buy defensive towers and click on them again to upgrade(if you have enough money, of course) Shoot with left click and rotate the shooter with mouse cursor. W A S D to move.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T15:26:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d25/d25b92508dfeeb77ff1eb1efd4a469bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brolander"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
