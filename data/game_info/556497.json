This game is all about avoiding obstacle and completing levels. Huh? You might be thinking what's hard just avoid obstacle there are many games like these, yes ik but This game is hard because of how many obstacle are there and the sensitivity (hehe you cannot decrease it its there to make it hard) also there is clam music so you like it lmao. As of now there are not much level as it is in development but there is still levels that can make you rage &lt;3. Some might be extremely hard and some easy. All levels are possible and it took myself like so much time to complete\u00a0 those levels. So if ya wanna try then you are go ahead I hope ya like it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:56:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd2/cd2ef1d7eafebd4d1288ffd44465d584.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CrystalNP"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
