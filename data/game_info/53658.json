It is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up in the vein of Gradius and R-Type. The game is notable for its unique visual design, as the game takes place inside the intestinal tract of a giant alien organism. Abadox is also known to be difficult, since it takes one hit from an enemy projectile to be killed. In Abadox, if a player is killed, one must restart from a checkpoint passed before death.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1988-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-18T16:58:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b2/7b2ddc03ca5fbfec457706aeb9690beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7, "beaten": 9, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 5, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["NATSUME"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Natsume", "Milton Bradley"], "esrb_rating": null}
