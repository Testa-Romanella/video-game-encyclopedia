I hope this is enough to explain why I stopped this project and if I do plan on revisiting this game I will have to do it all over again, and I am fine with that I just hope I learn from this time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/272/2725da227835218e006dd24101b83bc5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["MizuKubora"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
