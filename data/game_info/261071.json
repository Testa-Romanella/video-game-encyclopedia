It should incorporate the keyword \"beyond\". I did this by limiting visibility for the player, so the player constantly has to fear what lies beyond his sight. It was a lot of fun and work to make this game, but I loved every minute of it (though my family probably felt differently about it). I did the graphics myself and as you can see I am fairly new to this part. The music was taken from nosoapradio_us, a great site on facebook with lots of free music for indie game developers. <br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy the game and I would love to have feedback on it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c83a30eb016ef2d1d1c2db9c901a67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vh-games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
