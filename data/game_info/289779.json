Featuring music by Joel Whitaker!\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/joel-whitaker</p>\n<p>Click on the arrow in the bottom right to continue the dialogue. You can also hold down the button if you don't feel like clicking a hundred times. Some other gameplay elements (also featuring clicking) will show up in the game, but it's extremely basic.</p>\n<p>This is very much a work in progress and only has about 10% of what I wanted to have in the game, but I\u00a0ran out of time with the jam's deadline and also other life things happening. Hopefully I'll have meaningful additions ready soon. Thanks for checking it out anyway!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T05:09:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c02/c029f7e05c64694bc82f6e54b261ad6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["superhiero"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
