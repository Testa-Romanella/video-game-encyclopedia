Theoretically games can continue indefinitely, but will it? A score of 20,000 is possible.

The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces.</p>\n<p>You are <em>not</em> the player.</p>\n<p>The player is shown which piece will appear next. It is your task to construct this piece and submit it to the player in the given time. The player's performance has no bearing on your score. You score points by creating and submitting\u00a0valid pieces. The faster you can submit it, the more points you will get. There is also a small easter egg that will award 3,333 points, if you dare waste time trying to find/score the points.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move with WASD and use the mouse to look around.</p>\n<p>Space to Jump.</p>\n<p>Left Shift to crouch (no idea why you'd want to, it's a left-over feature from when I started).</p>\n<p>Blocks can be picked up using the 'E' key.<br/></p>\n<p>With a block in hand:</p>\n<ul><li>'E' again to 'Drop' the block</li><li>'Q' to 'Place' the block (on a placeable area)</li><li>Right Mouse Button to 'Aim'</li><li>Left Mouse Button to 'Yeet' the block</li><li>Mouse Wheel to 'Spin' the block</li></ul>\n<p>Press 'Esc' to open the 'Pause' menu</p>\n<p><strong>How to Play</strong></p>\n<p>Place blocks on the checkered\u00a0'Work Area' in the required shape.\u00a0<em>Note that you are viewing the player's 'screen' from behind. This is important.</em><br/></p>\n<p>Mix the correct color at the paint mixer. The selected ratios are shown in the big canisters and the current 'mixed' color is shown in the little mixer canister on the mixer. Use 'E' and 'Q' to flip the levers up or down.</p>\n<p>Once you have created\u00a0the correct shape and picked the correct\u00a0color, press the red button. The purple 'Block Press' will create the piece. Place the piece on the blue 'Validator'. Valid pieces will ascend into the game for the player to use, while incorrect pieces will be rejected.</p>\n<p>Rejected pieces can be recycled in the green 'Recycler'. Use the recycler. It has a laser.</p>\n<p>When the player completes a line, the removed blocks will be returned for reuse via the yellow 'Drop Chute'.</p>\n<p>I think there are 52 blocks in play. If the player sucks, you will start to run out of blocks. Not my fault. Blame PRNG. (This has changed. The game will now add a few more blocks - within reason - if you run out)</p>\n<p>Just keep going for as long as you can before you run out of time. Time will gradually get shorter as you progress, and\u00a0returned pieces are further away from the 'Work Area. And the machines are slow.</p>\n<p><strong>Things to Keep in Mind</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>You are viewing the player's screen from behind. I mention this again because it is important.</li><li>A 4x4 piece will not fit in the 'Validator' or 'Recycler'. Don't do it, you are just reducing the number of blocks available to you.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Missing Stuff</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Fun</li><li>Something else I can't remember</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Broken Stuff</strong></p>\n<ul><li>There may be some missing colliders which mean you may be able to walk through some things, or yeet blocks through solid matter. Sorry, only so much I could do (without cramming) in the time I had. Maybe I'll award you with some points (*wink* *wink*) for finding a specific\u00a0missing collider</li></ul>\n<p>There are probably loads of other missing/broken stuff that I didn't mention or don't even know about.</p>\n<p><strong>At least pretend to have fun.</strong></p>\n<p>I had fun making it. There is a lot happening here that may not be apparent. There's an actual game of Tetr... popular falling blocks game happening. There's (very) simple AI playing it. I have to analyse and identify whatever configuration of blocks you construct (thank you Stack Exchange's Code Golf for helping with this one). I have to make the mesh for that block configuration. The machines all have 'procedural' animations. The only\u00a0<em>actual</em> animation is the conveyor belts.<br/></p>\n<p>I had an idea of what I wanted the game to look like. This is not it.\u00a0It's ugly. I am no 3D artist.</p>\n<p><em>I used Verbalase's beatbox without permission. Sorry, it was just too good not to have as the soundtrack.</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T18:31:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/95c/95cc8bcbbeb2064f343a5bec6a4e8232.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bixarrio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
