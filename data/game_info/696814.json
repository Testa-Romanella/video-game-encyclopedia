Players must manipulate the Black Market and fellow inmates alike to survive through this prison of extremism, drugs, and a desperate fight to maintain identity. The \u201cSeries Director\u201d system tracks the actions of the player to present the most relevant episode for the current climate of the prison. ClownWorld is always listening; there are always consequences for what it hears.</p>\n<p>In ClownWorld, every prisoner has an ideology and often their gang affiliation gives them a nice echo chamber to make this ideology even more extreme and violent. If you have any chance of getting what you need, much less understanding what happened to these people, you must engage in the most hectic, partisan, performative debates possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be placing arguments to make your points, countering your opponents to weaken their statements, and interrupting to knock down their entire tower of arguments in Turn-Based Strategy Card gameplay with Real-Time elements. Articulate, Gish Gallop and Pivot to outsmart your fellow inmates in this mix of Hearthstone and Tetris. Build the strongest argument tower or just play to your audience to win, who cares which.\r\n</p>\n<p>This gameplay isn\u2019t strictly Turn-Based. Reflex-based gameplay options like juggling arguments to delay their effects or interrupting your opponent\u2019s turns are balanced with deep strategy, deck building and knowledge application to create intense, fist fights of discourse where any board state is a recoverable tug-of-war.\r\n</p>\n<p>In this DEMO of ClownWorld proper, you'll be debating; Derek\u00a0Shovin', arguing for the myriad of reasons I should have your money. NAE, arguing for the very intellectual stance of tits over ass. Tommy Ohwell, giving your best defence to avoid prison. And finally Yordan\u00a0Feterson, and why men are still doing fine in society.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T08:56:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/74a/74ae952ebf8dc11b4d7c3aebdf17fe88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bubbly = Nae"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
