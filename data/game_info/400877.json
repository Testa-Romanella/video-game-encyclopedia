The player has the ability to \"camouflage\" himself/herself to hide from the guards. But when camouflaged, the player attracts the attention of other worldly being(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal is to hide from the guards and infiltrate the base while also evading the other worldly being(s) when in camouflage mode.</p>\n<p><strong>Lore:</strong></p>\n<p>\tWhile mining deep in the jungle, natives found a mysterious red diamond. Since nothing of this caliber had been discovered before, me and my subordinates were sent to the location to observe the gem. Soon we discovered that the gem had immense power behind it, like nothing seen before. With our calculations this gem, soon to be named the Gem of Chikara, could power an entire continent for thousands of years; this gem was the answer to the energy crisis we were looking for! Oh, how could we be so foolish?</p>\n<p>\tThey called me a mad man. I know what I saw. The gem\u2019s power surged through me, and when I attempted to shield my face from its blast, I saw a different world before me. Well, not entirely different, but my world, our world, had turned blood red. Before I knew it, I was being chased by these creatures akin to what one would call\u2026 a demon. These \u201cdemons\u201d got closer and closer, until I finally attempted to shield myself again and was brought back to the real world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\tI attempted to tell someone, anyone, what I had seen. Eventually, the local doctors chalked it up to radiation poison and had me kicked off the project. I know what I saw. I know what those\u2026 \u201cdemons\u201d want. I need to break back in with this new power and destroy the Gem of Chikara.</p>\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Aziztitu \"Azee\" Murugan<br/></p>\n<p>William \"Gavin\" Lacalle</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T02:00:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e89/e8943744111c8d14df63ac1d19bb25b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 352, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Azee", "Dragon_Swigy"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
