Together with her deadly companions she sets out to hunt down the ghosts of her past...<h3>Play a team of five unique assassins</h3><br/>In the style of the main game, you take control of five skillful assassins, including Aiko, to sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Aiko's companions are just as deadly as her:<br/>Hayato is an agile ninja, who clears the way silently with his sword and shuriken. The mighty samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat multiple foes at once. Yuki is a young thief, who places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate. The wise marksman Takuma, however, relies on his sniper rifle and distracts enemies with his loyal pet companion Kuma. <br/><br/><h3>Define your playstyle</h3><br/>Choose your approach when infiltrating enemy bases in hidden forest camps or lively Edo period towns.
