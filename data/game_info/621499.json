(SOLO)</p>\n<p>Linked Life is a 2D platformer\u00a0where the player's and enemies health are linked.</p>\n<p>In Linked Life, your own health and the health of the enemies you fight are linked. The first time you hit an enemy, the health of the enemy is set to the health of the player (minus one because you just damaged them). The way to gain health is the same. Each time you bounce on an enemy (you don't have to hit their head, it only looks for if you are going down), you gain one health with a maximum of five.</p>\n<p>To complete a level you must find the key, once you collect the key you then go to the lock, one you go over the lock while you have the key, then you will go to the next level. There are 5 levels in this game, and the last one has different music.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0did NOT make any of the sprites or the music. The sprites are all from kenney.nl, and the music is from Jonas Tyroller's Wowie Resource Pack. The only thing that I\u00a0did was choose what sprites and music to use.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this solo using the Godot engine, the only thing that I\u00a0had\u00a0originally planned was that the player's health and the enemies health were linked. That is how the game fits the theme.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:<br/></p>\n<p>ASD/ARROW KEYS to move</p>\n<p>SPACE/W/UP ARROW to jump</p>\n<p>I'm sure that there are more that Godot has by default.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T23:02:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68b02e14614459bcbca5a428024639e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["GamEsnitzhel"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
