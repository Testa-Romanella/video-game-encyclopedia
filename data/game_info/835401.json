The prompt table will slowly guide you through weeks of small moments that lead to loads of thinking to get your imagination and creativity cooking.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was built for the 'One Page RPG Jam 2022' and the theme of 'Exploration' where my brain instantly thought of the two most important things to explore: stories, and ourselves. So I took to this game being inspired by what helps me break writer's block and find inspiration - and I actually believe that playing this game could help you break writer's block in your own writing for a story - though I hold no responsibility if it sinks you into the depths of madness.</p>\n<p>To play this game, you only need a d20, a d6, a single coin,\u00a0and the way and will to write out an awesome adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>This game was created using the\u00a0Second Guess System by Gamenomicon\u00a0- which is utterly brilliant in construction - and inspired by their\u00a0Hard Case\u00a0game - a brilliant single page of construction and genre.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you like this, please check out my other single page solo journaling rpgs:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Welcome To Faraday\u00a0- a suburban horror story\r\n</li><li>The Seven Islands of Qoy\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0a mystical\u00a0kung fu tournament story\r\n</li><li>The Lighthouse at Kindred Rocks\u00a0- an eerie coastal town mystery\r\n</li><li>The Heist on Foley Lane\u00a0-\u00a0a revenge heist story\r\n</li><li>The Cave Outside Heltrap\u00a0- a fantasy cave clearing adventure</li><li>Escape From Isla del Mundo\u00a0 - a monster island survival adventure</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T07:33:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/853df0e4fe46411ff58ab8f1ce94ca62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ryanklindsay"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
