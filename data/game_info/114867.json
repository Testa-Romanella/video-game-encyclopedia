For no real reason, he can squirt ink out of himself. Doing so allows him to temporarily float in the air. However, ink is toxic to Squirt, so too much exposure to ink will make him explode.</p>\n<p>Made in 48 hours for the GMTK GAME JAM, Squirt is a brutally difficult 2D platformer with flying and gliding mechanics. However, using too much ink will cause Squirt to overload, so make sure to cool down by keeping his stubby feet on the ground.</p>\n<p>Use (WASD) to move around and press (SPACEBAR) to fly (controllers should work too, btw)</p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unity, Krita, Visual Studio, Auxy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d6b/d6b90268efa6a93f99a1bad4b7c8d219.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["portal17"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
