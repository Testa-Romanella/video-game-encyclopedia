It was submitted late, in the fall of 2020, as the author felt the need to slowly construct themselves anew (post-COVID-19 and post-a-semi-surprising-ADHD-diagnosis) before attempting to finish it. It was formatted and published using Twine, an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. It was inspired, in part, by an ex-lover who maybe/probably wrongfully claimed he was talented at sex but //did// live within hearing distance of a multitude of bird songs. Also, by all the writers cited. Also //also//, by Shea, who kindly offered feedback on a stuck first draft.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-27T08:49:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/803/803d9228f35b0f6df45cadef790f9297.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oldannotations"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
