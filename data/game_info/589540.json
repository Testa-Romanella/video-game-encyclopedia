The only catch, these villains are spread out all throughout the past and future. It would be an easy job for you but it seems your time travelling ship is malfunctioning. Every 10 seconds in sends you to a different time period. Will you be able to defeat all of time's most dangerous villains or will your time run out?</p>\n\n<p>This is my first game jam! I've messed around around and made some games in my free time but never actually completed anything. This is my first complete work, I'm sure it's a little buggy and the gameplay isn't too in depth. I made it in about 2 days time and I\u00a0would appreciate any feedback. Thank you for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-23T05:41:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/114/11439f5f9dc8af594c96b524f68fdcd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnimalFat"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
