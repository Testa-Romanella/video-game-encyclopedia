The theme of the jam was to make a violent genre non-violent. I picked the battle-royale genre, as it tends to be dominated by violent games, and Shell Out Showdown eventually came to life!<br/><br/>These other molasses game jam games are also on Steam:<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585350/Cooperative_Chess/<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603590/My_Cousin_the_Rogue/<br/>https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603520/Save_Data/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T03:57:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec828f41e70b171d30af819daab6d24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["manadream"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["BAD Collective", "manadream entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
