{"id": 542314, "slug": "red-fury", "name": "Red Fury", "name_original": "Red Fury", "description": "A fast paced arcade style action where you carve your way through enemies, becoming stronger as you are covered in their blood and from your own wounds. Nearly all enemies can be defeated in a few blows, including bosses, leading to intense battles that can be decided in seconds, and leaving little room for the pace to slow down as you charge from beginning to end. How the game develops changes depending on your performance, providing several endings and discoveries to make through multiple playthroughs.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T04:50:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb6b7ddc26d8cb9c88a82bda2fb36f12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aikkyo", "Pepper Democracy"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Pepper Democracy"], "esrb_rating": null}
