It has a sole intention of bringing living beings together to a time called forever. However, love also causes drama and pain. Experience a mindblowing steel loving text-based adventure starring multiple of your favourite characters and find out who the real star of love is.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>I have never made anything like this\u00a0and I have zero experience in any of this. Literally every simple step took me way too long. But it was fun. I hope at least one person plays and finishes this game. Thank you if you play it.</p>\n<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>I used sound effects from https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>I used several character drawings of Kyle Bosman as basis for some of the pictures</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-30T11:21:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8db/8db553e3124832a1aaaba1e400bf0db4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DarkPikachu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
