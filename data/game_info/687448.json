You in the role of the main character have to find the missing girl named Lilly. Take what you find to follow her traces and survive the lurking evil.</p>\n<p><strong>My intention</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This is the early development progress of my approach on a survival horror game. I had a lot of fun to arrange the assets and to construct an idea of a story. Please comment below, in case you want to insert your ideas of how this game should be. Thank you in advance!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Some remarks</strong><br/></p>\n<p>I made this demo with Unity using paid assets from the Unity Asset Store. Any donation is appreciated. It will be spend into further development.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>W, S, A, D = Movement<br/>Shift = Run<br/>Space = Jump<br/>LMouse = Shoot</p>\n<p><strong>Download and unzip</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the upload limit of 1GB i had to split the ZIP into 2 files. You can just download both and extract the first file with 7zip or similar tool. It should then automatically extract both files.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T05:11:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db2bd105fdb76fbe88c6e291e646f142.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ultra Wide Only"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
