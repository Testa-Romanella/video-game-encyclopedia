The depth is 4\u00a0moves (approx. 7^4 = 2401 future states calculated), because any higher makes the decision time a couple minutes at best. Using the\u00a0Connect-4 Starter Code\u00a0and these\u00a0Images for the Pieces to start, I coded the minimax algorithm using a rather basic evaluation function: I assigned the player's piece a value of 1, the AI's piece a value of -1, and empty a value of 0. The value of a line (four in a row) is the sum of the pieces in the line, and the value of a state would be the sum of all the possible lines. That's it! Then I added some cute customization like the pieces' looks and their random rotations, and here we are.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<p>\r\n  \r\n    Connect-4 Starter Code\r\n  \r\n <br/>\r\n  Images for the Pieces\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-25T04:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4cff3163a955869880bfee6d4021f5f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["yehf-bxsci"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
