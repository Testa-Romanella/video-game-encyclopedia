It's been a while now since I've released a game with everything going on in life right now. Spent a lot of time on this project relearning skills I lost from the break but I'm trying to work on spreading out my work load a bit more so I don't burnout like I did back after Dagger Toss. Took some inspiration from flappy bird on this project and just worked off a weird camera rotation bug that I ran into lol. Overall it was a frustratingly easy project. Thanks for sticking around and I hope you enjoy the game.<br/><br/></p>\r\nUpdate Notes<p>Screenshots coming soon.<br/>Downloads for\u00a0Windows/Mac/Linux coming soon.<br/>Developed In Unity 2020.3.20f1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T08:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a43/a43d013e6c12fa6db1540ec177b25223.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mitchell Todd"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
