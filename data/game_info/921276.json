The ending of the game has direct connections with this year's theme. Overall we wanted to have some fun making this project, so we just made crazy and sometimes stupid ideas come true. The gameplay and mechanics might be a bit raw at the first glance, the reason is probably that our ideas was a bit too ambitious for the time we had. But I think it's all about the process and having fun. So our team is happy to present you our game, hope you will like it.<br/></p>\n<p>GamePlay<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>VideoEndGame<br/>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PJ0HbEY9-5FHHgdjx0x2UZtTwnqbSG59/view?usp=share...</p>\n<p>Download for PC<br/>\u00a0https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kpW4doFnuJ37kwFulNeBcWI8mh6yJPPS/view?usp=share...</p><p>GlobalGameJamSite<br/></p><p>https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/thirstyplant-5<br/></p>\n<p>https://github.com/SerhiiHladkov/ThirstyPlant</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T21:21:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf3/bf307b31834a5e78decc4d71434e4591.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["D4NDY_0"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
