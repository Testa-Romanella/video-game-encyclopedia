Unlike many other \u2018end-of-the-world\u2019 games, Wanda is not about a tale of desperate survival but about finding companionship, love and hope in a wasteland.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wanda is a story-focused game but completely free of comprehensible dialogue. The entire story is told through the subtle interactions between the two robots and the environment itself in a \u201cshow, don't tell\" style.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Join this little adventure, solve mini-puzzles and witness the story unfold. Experience a whole new perspective of a post apocalyptic world through art-style reminiscent of a children\u2019s book and delightful soundtracks.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-20T17:28:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a9/5a98e6ae2a05125080c0de841ba343c4.jpg", "website": "http://www.kodotsgames.com", "rating": 1.83, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 126, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 9, "ratings_count": 6, "suggestions_count": 286, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 6, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kodots Games"], "genres": ["RPG", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Kiss"], "esrb_rating": null}
