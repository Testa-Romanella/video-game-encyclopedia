The enemies will generally approach the player from two direction on a 2D plane (the left and right of the player). Once they get close enough the player will be able to shine their flashlight on the shadows and revealing the enemy to be a normal object (destroying them and rewarding points.)</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u201d Key - Shine light Left</p>\n<p>\u201cD\u201d Key - Shine light Right</p>\n<p>Left Arrow and Right Arrow Keys (or LMB and RMB) can also be used!</p>\n\n<p>Programmer/Hero\u00a0Who Stays up till 6AM\u00a0 to finish a game: <br/>\t\tIndieManiaC\t(https://indiemaniac.itch.io/)<br/></p>\n<p>Music: \t\t\tDoof(Allen Opperman)(https://soundcloud.com/alleno-1)</p>\n<p>Art  pattaq  (https://www.facebook.com/colorfolcomics/)</p>\n<p>Designer:\tzettovyker\t(https://www.youtube.com/user/zettovyker)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Q.

Why is the game so short?<br/></p>\n<p>A. It's everyone's first time doing a game jam, so we are all learning as we go.\u00a0Also see above answer.</p>\n<p>Q. Why does this flashlight only work at short distance?</p>\n<p>A. Its uh... low on battery.</p>\n<p>Q. But shouldn't a low battery flashlight still work at full range?</p>\n<p>A. The character suffers from myopia.</p>\n<p>Q.\u00a0What is myopia?</p>\n<p>A. Nearsightedness.
