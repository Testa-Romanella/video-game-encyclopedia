If that happens, the island will <strong>run out of control</strong> very fast.</p>\r\nHow to Play?\r\n<p>The game is fully playable with the Mouse. Left Mouse drags the view, Right Mouse rotates the camera and the middle mouse controls the zoom. You can drag and drop the UI elements to add it into the scene.</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>This game was made in a few hours (like, 2 hours) for the <strong>GMTK Game Jam 2020</strong>!
