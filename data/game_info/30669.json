It is the sequel to BioWare&#39;s Neverwinter Nights, based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pencil and paper fantasy role-playing game. Neverwinter Nights 2 utilizes an adaptation of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 edition rules. Players create player characters to represent themselves in the game, using the same character creation rules as found in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. They may gain the assistance of additional party members, and they eventually acquire a keep that can be used as a base of operations. Neverwinter Nights 2 is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting\u2014in and around the city of Neverwinter. The story is mostly unrelated to Neverwinter Nights and follows the journey of an orphaned adventurer investigating a group of mysterious artifacts known as &quot;silver shards&quot; and their connection to an ancient, evil spirit known as the King of Shadows.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T17:35:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b62/b62e47a7a8bf28da08300aa9ec88f809.jpg", "website": "http://www.atari.com/nwn2/", "rating": 4.06, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 22, "owned": 42, "beaten": 81, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 50, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 12, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 109, "suggestions_count": 519, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 109, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Obsidian Entertainment"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Atari"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
