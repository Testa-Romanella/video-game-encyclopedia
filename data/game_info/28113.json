You will be tweaking your car components, testing them on track, setting your throttle controls, and finally racing your chosen car to earn coin and gain experience which will be used to unlock and buy higher level components for your car, enabling it to handle better and go even faster, or track parts to construct any of the 26 tracks with up to 8 lanes or create your very own custom made tracks from scratch.<br/><br/><strong>Before you do anything</strong><br/>Please read the Throttle set up section in the manual. VSC offers a unique configurable 3 key solution to control your car throttle. Understanding how it works, practising in a practise session, per lane, per track, and configuring it using the interface causes your settings to be recorded. These settings will then be used during a race, and are paramount for obtaining the best slot car experience. Soon VSC will further offer complete custom key binding which will enhance this feature even more.<br/><br/><strong>Single Player</strong><br/>At the start you will be provided with a basic car and set of track parts which will allow you to practise and compete in entry level races. As you get familiar with car handling and maintenance you will soon be winning races and gaining experience and coin. Before you know it you will be able to challenge the next level of AI opponents on longer tracks with more lanes at even faster speeds, as you work towards the ultimate level of Ace, racing at potential speeds well in excess of 70 km/h. Alternatively, you can spend your time and coin creating new elaborate custom tracks in the track editor. The options are endless.<br/><br/><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/>Race against friends in Multiplayer with your own personalised car. Host custom track circuits that you made, with your own set of racing rules and car configuration limits. Create your own <strong>car body mods</strong> and import them into the game for your friends to see and race against. While VSC offers its own track-set parts, it also offers full <strong>modding support</strong> allowing you to create your very own blue-print to track-set solution, to create any specific track you can dream of. If you find you do not have the track or car body you want to race with, and you are not a modder, the option to obtain your perfect car or track will be made available through the community of modders.<br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Player levels:</strong> Beginner, Regular, Advanced, Pro, Ace.
