It is the first video game I've ever made and the first time I've used C# or Unity. I learnt a lot while making it, and I hope you can learn something from playing it.</em></p>\n<p>This is a puzzle game, inspired somewhat by the likes of Zachtronics. The levels are intended to teach you about the basic quantum gates and how they can be used to manipulate qubits.</p>\n<p>Due to the focus of the game, knowing how matrices and complex numbers work would be very helpful. However, I\u00a0hope that the interactive experimentation available to a player allows anyone to solve the puzzles.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T07:15:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2ba0582079181a0ce8764a5840ce960.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["lumoslabs"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
