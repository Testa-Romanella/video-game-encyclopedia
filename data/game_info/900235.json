I'm Cameron, and this is my very first attempt at creating a game so please go easy on me! It is my goal with Tactic Legends to make this not only the most fun tactics game out there, but to bring it to mobile in a way that feels natural to play without requiring tons of time investment. Matches are designed to be shorter than most other games in this genre, and player vs player focused instead of a singleplayer focused story.</p>\n<p>I've developed this came by myself (mostly) using Unity and their Visual Scripting feature, meaning 99% of this game was created without a single line of code ever being written! It's taken me a little over a year and a half to get this far so I hope you'll enjoy!</p>\n<p>If you want to be apart of the development process, get a behind-the-scenes look, or just make friends with the small community Tactic Legends has gathered together, please join us on the official Discord server!</p>\n<p>With enough support, I hope to bring a bunch more features to the game, some of which include:</p>\n<p>- Custom map creator</p>\n<p>- Cooperative content</p>\n<p>- Single player content</p>\n<p>- Additional characters</p>\n<p>- and additional maps!</p>\n<p>Over 250+ hours of game development live streamed on Twitch and YouTube!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:25:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3df99d87896d59c86a26c9b479ab8cb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 209, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["camerondwills"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
