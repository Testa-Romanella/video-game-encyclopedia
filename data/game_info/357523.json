Filled with boxes and wacky physics.\u00a0At the moment I have only included 2 Sections in the build. More will come later when I release the final game.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD and Arrow keys both work.</p>\n<p>Press \"Space\" To jump. There is double jump enabled. Touch ground to refresh.<br/>You can never stop your Box. Only slow down or speed up.<br/>Q and \"Esc\" goes back and exit the game.\u00a0<br/>R is for quick Retry / Restart run.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Trailer\"</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>Feel free to send any feedback to josh@topswagcode.com or here in the comments.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:49:45", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["topswagcode"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
