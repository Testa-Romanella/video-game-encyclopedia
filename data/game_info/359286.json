{"id": 359286, "slug": "gravity-control-2", "name": "Gravity Control", "name_original": "Gravity Control", "description": "Gravity Control is a puzzle platformer where you don\u2019t control the player directly but indirectly by changing the gravity direction. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGuide the player to the wormhole that brings you to the next level. There are 60 levels to overcome. Each level challenges the player differently, some are more action-focused whereas other levels will need the player to use their brain.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBe surprised by obstacles that are needed to be avoided, like moving spikes and rotating lasers. By changing the direction of the gravity not only the player but also crates will move in the gravity direction. Some crates will operate the open and closing of nearby doors or turning the lasers on and off. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe stages will become more challenging the further you progress. How well the player is handling the floaty astronaut will determine if you don't crash into an obstacle. In later levels switching triggers on and off will require more thinking because the number of blocks will increase.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:43:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/157/1570385ac579d2a64421430b3213a8ff.jpg", "website": "http://www.nannings.nz", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Tuwi Michael Nannings"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NanningsGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
