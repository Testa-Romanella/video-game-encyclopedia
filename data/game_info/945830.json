You have a limited number of jumps so make sure you collect powerups to recharge yourself. Avoid obstacles and don't fall!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As my first mobile app, I decided to heavily lay into the general trend of mobile apps being simplistic and easy to pick up. The vast majority of time I spent working on this game was focused on tweaking and even removing features to minimalize the game as much as possible. With this design the game is so simple that you can learn and experience its entire gameplay loop in under a minute.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T11:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bf1/bf1c0f5ef8ef6c03300339bfd338090d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Zokie0"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
