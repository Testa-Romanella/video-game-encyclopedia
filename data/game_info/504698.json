The clock on the wall shows your current state, keep it low, you MUST keep it low.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:\u00a0\u00a0</strong>(ASWD /Arrow Keys)<br/><strong>Pickup:\u00a0</strong>Spacebar (hold)</p>\n<p>OCD feels like being stuck in a loop, someone with OCD may have an intense desire to resolve a mental conflict. When that conflict is resolved, the mind re-fires and the desire returns with full (or greater) force.</p>\n<p>You may wash your hands, then feel immediately as if their hands need to be washed again. It's not uncommon for people who suffer from this affliction to wash their hands so much that they permanently damage their skin. </p>\n<p>For me, I have not experienced this, but I have experienced the overwhelming need to confess (even though I couldn't think of what to confess), or an over analysing of my physical health (returning to the doctor weekly and not having anything to tell them), or an overwhelming fear that I was going to hurt someone I loved.</p>\n<p>All of these things were not rational, but they did affect me deeply and intensely and they would loop in my mind until I did mental compulsions to soften the edge. </p>\n<p>Those compulsions perpetuate the \"loop\" and it wasn't until I went to a psychologist that I was given the tools to escape the loop. <br/></p>\n<p><em>created in 48 hours by David McDonald for the Ludum Dare game jam.
