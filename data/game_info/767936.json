This project was made over the duration of 12 hours for a game jam. Its not a terribly advance game and feels like a terrible pong knock off but its fun to just play in the background when you waiting for something to download or update. <br/><br/>somethings like highscore may be a bit confusing to read at first as there's no text that indicates that its even the highscore, but I was trying to fit everything into a single script including textures so I had to strip it down to the essentials and only the essentials. This game only exist to prove the point that it is possible for even an idoit like myself to create a \"game\" in the size of a preview image.<br/><br/>controls:<br/>move left with\u00a0A, move right with\u00a0D<br/>to start press A or D<br/>and press the A or D to restart after dying</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-09T04:07:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45c6f77e161d627a36e3415cb4e5be7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stondonk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
