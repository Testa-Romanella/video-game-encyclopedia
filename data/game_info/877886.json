I created a custom song to play during the main menu section of my game. I used the composer feature in the app My Singing Monsters.\u00a0I was going to make a new background for my game for my first modification but my iPad kept crashing and deleted my progress.</p>\n<p>2. I\u00a0created a custom song to play during the levels of my game. I used the composer feature in the app My Singing Monsters. This feature acts as a soundboard with different instruments and vocals. </p>\n<p>3. I made level three more complex in comparison to the first two levels. In this level, you must jump on the head of your enemies to collect the key.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by: Kristina Malkowski</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T17:47:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/03a/03a51675629ba5d8fa8f66c19601cb6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["kristinamalkowski"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
