In order to escape the maze, you need to explore it and find weapons in chests, avoid traps, kill monsters and defeat bosses.</p>\n<p>There are three types of mazes, a stone maze, an ice maze, and a desert maze. In each maze you face different enemies and bosses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are multiple difficulty levels, so depending on your skill level you can select the one which fits your needs.</p>\n<p>There are also two different game modes. In the \"Monster Maze\" you need to fight against evil monsters and defeat a boss at the end in order to escape the maze. In the\u00a0\"Maze\" there are no monsters to kill, so you can focus on finding the exit of the maze.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Nineteendo</li><li>Skeffles</li><li>waza</li><li>Neat Games</li><li>Ness Codes</li><li>Text Guy;</li><li>SplatterHatStudio</li><li>JukeSir</li><li>Juliecorn</li><li>Fumix Studio</li><li>XenoScapeTeam</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play the game</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Use the W, A, S, D keys or the arrow keys\u00a0to move</li><li>Attack by pressing the left mouse button</li><li>Press E to access your backpack</li><li>Press 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to select the different inventory slots</li><li>Press B to delete a selected item</li><li>Press the \"Mute Music\" button while playing to mute the music</li><li>Press the \"Generate\" button while playing to generate a new maze</li><li>Loot Chests by running into them (sometimes they don't contain loot)</li><li>Kill the boss</li><li>Have fun!\u00a0:-)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Give feedback / Report bugs</strong></p>\n<p>You can give the developer of this game feedback and/or report bugs.
