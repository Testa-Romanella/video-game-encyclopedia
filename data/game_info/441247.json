{"id": 441247, "slug": "kings-sea", "name": "Kings Sea", "name_original": "Kings Sea", "description": "<p><strong>Kings Sea</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Kings Sea is a simple arcade-style fish simulation game based on an old game for the Apple II called \"Odell Lake.\" I made this in a single weekend in order to teach myself unity. You are presented with various encounters and have 5 actions to take. You get the most points for the best action in each encounter for your fish. For example: A trout may encounter a worm and choose to eat it. Your goal is to survive as long as you possibly can and get the final encounter.</p>\n<p>I may, if people want, add the ability to play as more kinds of fish, but this was, in the end, meant to be a very small and simple game. The game tracks your high score so you can play and try to beat your high score as well.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T07:15:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e9e/e9e6d2a5d0bba56b378fe3e179faf0ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Untrustedlife"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
