You\u2019re left to face the outside world alone, but this can be both difficult and amazing when you have autism. Just because you have it, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy life. Some things can be harder to do, but you can do some incredible things as well. It just makes even the mundane parts of life, an experience.</p>\n<p>\"An Aspie Life\" is an experimental adventure game that deals with the topic of Asperger's Syndrome. The game is centred around having to live with autism. The players actions in the game will have to adapt to how an autistic person sees the world. As every element of this game recreates how some people with autism perceive the world, therefore all forms of sound, graphics and interactions are intentional.</p>\n<p>Your mission, as the player, is to survive doing normal everyday activities and tasks. The goal of the game is to keep health and emotions at maximum level. These health and emotion meters will determine the ending of the game.</p>\n<p>In An Aspie Life, you, the player must follow the outlined daily routine... But I never said it would be easy. From shopping to gaming, all events and interactions impact your day. You must decide what the correct decision is to keep yourself as happy and safe as you can be.</p>\r\nAwards\r\n\r\nImages", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/04f/04f7af8175710b609ac93329917db479.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 203, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["enderlost_studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
