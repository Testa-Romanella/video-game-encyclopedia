This ensures that each time a new mechanic is introduced, the player is at the peak of the Darkside effect, thus keeping the player in a constant upward mental flow experience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <br/><strong>Storyline guidance</strong></p>\n<p>Each major level corresponds to a relationship in which a letter is delivered, such as a letter from a parent to a child, a letter to a loved one, or a letter to a close friend. At the beginning of each big level, a text and CG will show the different meanings expressed by each letter. But most importantly, the story leads to \"love\". The letters are not just simple words or messages, but also symbols of great emotion. </p>\n<p><strong>UI guidance</strong></p>\n<p>In the UI section of the game, there is a left half and a right half, which corresponds to the system interface operations and the in-game messages. The in-game messages include the number of letters delivered to the target, the minimum number of steps recommended for the player to achieve, and the size of the character. These three conditions correspond to the three objectives of the game, and when the player has completed the objectives, the number of stars in the UI on the checkout page will indicate the achievements the player has achieved.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T17:04:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ff/6ff55a9f264f5d249d92d5941451248b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 176, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gnt007484"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
