Wrath of the Dead Rabbit", "description": "<p>Skeletonized rabbit Ash lives in Hell, he&#39;s a prince of that place. Ash is busy recovering his hellish reputation - killing everyone in Hell, who saw his photo with a rubber duckling in the bath. Apparently, among the princes of Hell to play with the duckling is not common. Each monster, killed by Ash, opens the way to the next - totally Ash has to kill a hundred monsters. <br />\nAsh is chasing monsters in several spaces that have their own design. Among them there is a cave, a laboratory, a spaceship with a team of talking animals and a casino.<br />\nThe game is good for its mood - ironic and humorous, which is maintained throughout the game and is always surprised by an abundance of jokes and fancies. The game is full of surprises. Unexpected ways of murder, stylish crazy monsters, excellent finds for the hero. There is always something going on in the game - and not only with the hero. On the whole space of the screen, the world lives and turns into something previously unprecedented and exciting.</p>", "metacritic": 64, "released": "2012-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-22T16:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1c417b405a86ed7d92b903e0fcfd0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.44, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 268, "owned": 3546, "beaten": 54, "toplay": 22, "dropped": 132, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 293, "suggestions_count": 403, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 293, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC"], "developers": ["Arkedo Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
