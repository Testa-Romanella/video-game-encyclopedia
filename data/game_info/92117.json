For hopeless romantic Brian and struggling writer Lee, the pursuit of love has been difficult. That is, until they meet the heroine! Can she help fill their lives with romance? Maybe even find some herself?</em><br/><br/><em>Everyone's a fool in love, but the heroine is here to help!\"</em><br/></p><p>Fool's Helper is a slice-of-life romantic comedy that consists of a prologue that splits into two routes, each with two endings, a friendship ending and a romance ending. The player chooses which route they would like to play immediately after the prologue. Endings are determined by simple choices during the routes, such as how the heroine reacts to a situation.<br/></p><p>Please feel free to report any bugs or errors that you encounter while playing.</p><p>I hope you guys enjoy this short game! :)<br/></p><p><strong>UPDATE 5/9/17</strong>: Nanami made a Spanish translation of Fool's Helper and I've now included an official build with her translation and in-game credits.
