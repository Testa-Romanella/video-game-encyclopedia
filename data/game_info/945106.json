Brought to life by the AI powerhouse of ChatGPT, you'll find yourself torn between love and loathing for your wickedly smart AI adversaries.</p>\n<p>Step into the arena and prepare to schmooze and bruise your way through each encounter. With a silver tongue and quick wit, you can charm the pants off any foe - but not literally, completely SFW here - and if pants diplomacy isn't your jam, let your fists do the thinking and claim a pantsless victory covered in the blood of your witless foe. This is your chance to become the ultimate Turing Brawler champ, champ!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T05:44:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93c/93cd7cd0cd270fe5c1377341a35f02e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Turner Monroe"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
