By collecting rum barrels your alcohol level increases, it does slowly decay overtime unless you collect new barrels, the goal is to complete the level being as drunk as possible!Ultimately your alcohol level determines your speed, but it also gets increasingly harder to control your character the more rum you drink.\u00a0<br/>Dealing with that lack of control you try to make your way across the ship filled with plenty of obstacles and mean parrots.<br/>In further development additional levels featuring: a progessively changing enviroment depending on your alcohol level, more powerups and other enemies will be added. Furthermore we plan to add a scoreboard where you rank depending on the time you took to finish the respective level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T06:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fe/3febbcf79ce02b74ae6914560c9c5d32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["volltoll"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
