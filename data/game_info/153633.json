While exploring a new planetoid, Flix takes an unfortunate nosedive into a chasm. It's your mission to guide Flix up and out of monster infested caves in the hopes of getting him back to his rocket-ship and the sanctuary of his cozy doggie home. <br/><br/>Highly inspired by the wonderful 8-bit classics, Flix The Flea returns to an almost forgotten sub-genre of cutesome high-jumping platform games. With a host of challenging environments and features, Flix creates just the right balance of fun and frustration for a very entertaining &amp; addictive gaming experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f37/f3794055b94db6d4072a82d31110b257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Psychotic Psoftware"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
