The themes of the Soviets vs the monarchists stemmed from a red ship with a boxing glove looking far too funny with a Soviet Hammer and Sickle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game functions on a best of three round system and was programmed by hand in Unity with C#. The movement and momentum are all custom built, which works well some of the time, but would have really required more time to polish it. Expect strange results from extended ramming.</p>\n<p>Created at the University of Portsmouth\u00a0Game Jam</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/533/533bd49ad720d10f2d73abbbeae20846.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tiernoon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
