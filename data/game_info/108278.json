Levels have a number of control terminals which need to be switched off. Guards patrol the corridors, trying to take you down as soon as they see you. Can you wake up humanity?\u00a0<br/>\n</p>\n\r\n\r\nStory\r\n<p>Everyone listens to a voice called The Message. It tells you what to do. Because of a short circuit The Message stops and you find yourself in control of your own thoughts. The only way to help the others following The Message is by switching off the terminals throughout the building. The Message is looking for you however.\u00a0</p>\r\n\r\nGameplay instructions\r\n<ul><li>Control your character's movement with the WASD keys.\u00a0</li><li>Press E to interact with doors and control terminals.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Programming: Jip Sterk\u00a0(Extra Nice), Rando Wiltschek (Extra Nice)\r\n<br/>Game Design &amp; Animation: Nils Slijkerman\u00a0(Extra Nice)\u00a0<br/>Level Design &amp; Testing: Friso Roolvink (Grendel Games)\u00a0<br/>Art: Mitchel Bonnema (Critical Bit)<br/>Music &amp; Sounds:\u00a0Menger &amp; Meester</p>\r\n\r\nChange Log\r\n<p>08.03.2018:</p>\n<ul><li>Added message for doors (locked, press E, etc.) and when picking up keycards</li><li>Tweaked camera movement so the player can look ahead and see doors better</li></ul>\n<p>07.03.2018:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Added radar</li><li>Tweaked audio volume</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3bf/3bfb99ded063ceff72a614c47fc7c46e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["laserbrick", "CriticalBit", "ExtraNice", "gameplayguy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
