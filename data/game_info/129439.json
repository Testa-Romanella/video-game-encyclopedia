When you're attacking you roll for attack while the enemy rolls for defense. A successful roll is a 4, 5 or 6 (though items make successes easier!). Successful blocks negate successful attacks and the damage is the difference.</p>\n<p>If you have an attack or defense potion you can drink it to gain an extra 4 dice until the next round.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5b/c5bedd1c12dc3f2a827b7d6d48d21ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Josh Perry"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
