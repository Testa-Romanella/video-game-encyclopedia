It all depends on you that you're gonna go all-in for high damage, or you'll follow a more balanced approach. You can try different tactics to find out which playstyle fits you the most.<br/>After you'll die you'll lose your stuff and your progress you've made in the city, but you can keep your earned XP. After leveling up you'll receive more money to spend on weapons and more points to spend on attributes.<br/>There are several active and passive skills and all of them have their unique advantages. Be sure to try all of them to find out which of them are the most useful for your style.<br/>The game uses a first person perspective, so your enemies will stand in front of you. You'll not only see their health bar, but their wounds too, which will be different depending on whether it was caused by your knife or your gun.<br/>Also, injuries do matter: for example, you can do higher damage by aiming at their body, but severely injuring their shooting arm will cause a massive drop in their aiming skill.<br/>After a successful fight, loot your defeated enemies for money, food or bulletproof vests..
