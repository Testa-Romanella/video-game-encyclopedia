Thank you for looking at this page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gameplay :<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The game is a tower defense, monsters follow a path and you have to kill them with towers that you place. The main difference here, to respect the limitation\u00a0<em>\"The Player is his own enemy\" ,\u00a0</em>is that the play can choose whether he lets the monsters go to the village or no in order to gain population, power or money.
