You play as a shapeshifter, trying to figure out who you are as the Lucosan Royal Guard chase you down. Will you hide who you truly are, or will you fight for your freedom?</p>\n<p>This game was a student project, created in about 10 months for my Senior Project. It is a short, free-to-play mini-metroidvania. In it, you play as Rez, a shapeshifter who must keep their ability secret. Your Ruirui form is highly mobile, yet struggles in combat. Your Lucosa form is powerful, but cannot move as effectively. Change between the two in secret to navigate an intricate, dangerous world. With 6 core upgrades, 9 optional upgrades, and nearly 60 rooms to uncover, there is much to see in the world of the Lucosa.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T11:27:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22f/22ff8505821054975bffd7e43b4a782a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nam3y123"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
