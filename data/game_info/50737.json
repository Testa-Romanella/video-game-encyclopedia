Sporting a wicked new ensemble and somehow familiar pigtails, the titular Umbra Witch must face a mysterious evil using her signature guns and time-slowing Witch Time ability. This time, invading manmade bioweapons called Homunculi find themselves in Bayonetta\u2019s crosshairs.</p>\n<p>Tap into Bayonetta\u2019s naughtier side with Demon Masquerade, a new ability that channels the demon linked to her weapon allowing for some exciting action options, not to mention some hair-raising combos. She can also summon her demonic darlings like Gomorrah, Malphas, and Phantasmaraneae during battle, unleashing their demonic powers in the heat of combat and in new, larger-than-life battles where you directly control the action.</p>\n<p>Fight your way through the streets of Tokyo, the mountains of China, and many other locales! Along the way you\u2019ll meet a virtual coven of Bayonettas, each more fabulous than the last. You\u2019ll also slash and slay as Viola, a feisty witch in training who fights with a sword and a capricious companion, the demon Cheshire. Find out what fate awaits Bayonetta, and if this arcane alliance can really save reality!</p>", "metacritic": 86, "released": "2022-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:52:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c30/c30ac50cb13096f5402250bf666a321c.jpg", "website": "https://www.platinumgames.com/games/bayonetta-3", "rating": 4.24, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 66, "owned": 32, "beaten": 59, "toplay": 292, "dropped": 13, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 62, "platforms": ["Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Platinum Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
