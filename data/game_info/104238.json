Get firewood and bring it back to your home before you freeze in the cold!</p><p>This game was made in about 3 weeks.

The money goes into developing the next one/live streaming daily.</p><p>- PATCH NOTES -</p><p>(1/9/16 @ 12:41am) If there is no collision model on a bridge you walked into, download the latest build!</p><p>(1/9/16 @ 10:41am) Fixed a bug with collision models not registering properly. I believe the SFX in the game starting up silent on first bootup until changed bug has been fixed, if someone could let me know, that'd be great. Also the menus are fully displayed at all times now, and there's an option for enabling and disabling Depth of Field.<br/></p><p>(1/12/16 @ 11:06am) Changed credits to be displyed along with the controls screen upon starting the game. MAY have fixed the sound bug. Fixed awkward collision model in cabin. Added 'SFX' text back to options slider.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c33/c33a6dc5942cfc8f078be4ba03438cea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["The Cooper J"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
