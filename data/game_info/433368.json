First you should play through the tutorial. If `tutorial` doesn't give you what you're looking for, try pressing `TAB` in a new line to see a list of commands. Each command has a documentation that can be read using `man [command]`.</p>\n<p>If you're wondering about services and requests, use `man list` to see all that you have unlocked. Then `man [request/service]` will tell you how to handle them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T05:04:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebc/ebcb317af486d1f71a7b1e66e39a6da5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["smeanox"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
