It is a 1 to 4 player couch co-op free for all. With 3 programers working on this I did not work on every system. I worked on systems such as health &amp; healthbars &amp; health packs, attacking ( shooting, bullet spawning, dealing damage), powerups &amp; crystal spawning, Player spawning,\u00a0\u00a0endgame event, other small changes. The gameplay flow includes selecting the amount of players and starting the game. you are then launched into the first of 3 rounds, during this round you start by running around killing other players and AI, you are able to heal with health packs and destroy crystals to gain power ups both of which are placed around the map. After a period of time a speical power crystal spawns in the center which give one of 4 extremely powerful powerups. After the crystal is spawned it will start a hidden countdown which will teleport all players into the center for a final battle. after one person is the last person standing the scorboard will show with hidden values. you then repeat the round 2 more times. once this is done it shows the final scoreboard and each player and AI's total score. you will then be returned to the main menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>how to play - (Note, using a xbox controller)</p>\n<p>1) Unzip the download &amp; click on \"Beak Betrayal.exe\"</p>\n<p>2) plug in a controler for each person playing</p>\n<p>3) click the A button on play</p>\n<p>4) click A on every controller that is going to be used &amp; once all are collected press LT</p>\n<p>5) move with left thumbstick &amp; shoot with right thumbstick</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-13T05:21:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/792/792f2378522971f0943d81ec9bad0b54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RT40111"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
