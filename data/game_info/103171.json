Players must manoeuvre their way through levels using the controls XCVB. You play as an L shaped arrow where the controls are: X to left and right. C to up and down. V to go in the direction of UP or DOWN. B to go in the direction of Left or Right. Get to the end of the levels. The game gets faster as you go along. Since being released it has received over 70,000 plays on Newgrounds as well as posts on Indie Statik and Gameological Sawbuck Gamer.</p><p>\r\n\tWelcome to XCVB FULL. Take a look at some of the free flash versions to see what you're getting yourself into with this one. Imagine them but improved. For anyone who buys this version I guarantee you another free game (but usually paid) of mine in the future. Most like SUPER XCVB. Which I hope to have out soon. </p><p>\r\n\t This game is rewarding to those players good enough to be rewarded. To those not, it scoffs at your shitness. Have fun. </p><p>Programming, Art, Game Design and Sound Effects by David Ryan</p><p>Menu and Game Music by Jarryd Atomsmasha Nielsen</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-12-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f5/6f53d3b76c791d93db354a4d63ffa8a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Ryan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
