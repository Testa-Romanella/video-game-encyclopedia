Sweet cherubs knowing nothing of the world. The extent of the cruelty man commits is rebuked by their muddy pen. You would die for them - you would absolutely kill for them. Treachery from hungry neighbors, soldiers, and hog thieves is a nightly horror which rattles your mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swine is a scenario for use in the\u00a0Violence system by Luke Gearing and -as far as I know- is compatible with his game, The Country. It can be played solo, but is better\u00a0commiserated with friends.</p>\n<p>Made by Mark Conway.<br/>Assets from the public domain.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T06:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/62e/62e2b5ae1c593ebc59f2572e5411e3b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blark"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
