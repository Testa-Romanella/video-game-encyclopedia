The theme is out of control, and this fits that theme by not giving the player control of their speed. The ship can only get faster, never slower, and when you turn it keeps going until you cancel it out by turning the other way.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to move as far away from the starting point as possible in any direction, while avoiding asteroids and other space junk in the process. Your space ship gradually speeds up over time and becomes very difficult. If you can reach a score of 1 million, you're a legend.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T18:12:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/757/7574dc6ec7f05fd47fd8156cf0ee36fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 103, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LethalChicken"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
