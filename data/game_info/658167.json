{"id": 658167, "slug": "ponpai-gameplay-prototype", "name": "Ponpai (Gameplay Prototype)", "name_original": "Ponpai (Gameplay Prototype)", "description": "<p>This is a prototype for a monster-collecting game that I'm making. Naturally, it's not exactly finished, but I wanted to get feedback for the battle system I currently have working.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>The game will open on the team selection screen. Choose any six ponpai by dragging them into your party (slots on the right).</p>\n<p>In the overworld, use WASD or the arrow keys to move, and shift or space to run. The green square lets you swap out your team again, and the red squares are enemies. Ignore the building, it does nothing.</p>\n<p>Battles are turn-based, and have three of your ponpai fighting against three enemies. You can move the currently selected ponpai with WASD or the arrow keys, then choose an attack by clicking the buttons at the bottom of the screen (this will end their turn). Instead of an attack, you can also click one of your reserve ponpai to swap them into battle (which will also end the turn). You can hover over any ponpai or attack to learn more about them. You may also run into status effects, or tile traps that heal, damage, or block ponpai standing on them.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy! Any constructive feedback would be much appreciated :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T06:52:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c9/0c9367b33830f1a3e289317111724616.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ponpai"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
