There are many approaches, and we combined establishing trust, breaking trust and something that all of us humans have - personality.\u00a0 Just like you can\u00a0 build up trust with someone you know, you can build up trust with the High Five Dudes.\u00a0Just play around with the simulation and see how different choices produce different outcomes.</p>\n<p>Each Dude has different\u00a0personality and reacts differently to player\u2019s actions depending on the character's nature, mood and previous interactions. This creates a rather complex system of building relations and trust with each Dude individually. </p>\n<p>The project is one in the series of rapid\u00a0prototypes made in less than a week. The intention of\u00a0making\u00a0games in team of 3 in extremely short development cycles was learning the\u00a0methods and theory in order to develop game ideas into testable prototypes\u00a0as quick as possible.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T04:24:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/85d/85d0e754a5fdcbee89e113b6a699bf34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["krzesimir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
