We are connecting a Top-Down Shooter with Telephony as a Service, and we will deliver a game that will interact with you through your phone. Get ready to jump into something new, and help our team to shape something new!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn this first version, there will be ONE STAGE and NO TELEPHONY SYSTEM. The Early Access will allow you to help developers shape two fronts: (1) Testing core mechanics like the GRAB and Throw system, different types of guns, and stage improvements; and (2) connecting all that with telephony.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe will have a Game Designer focused on Telephony interaction, and you'll be able to give us feedback on how it could be successfully implemented. We will also have a gameplay designer that will improve and change core mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe plan to deliver 16 stages, a comic book, and Telephony as a service, and putting it all together in the right way is the reason the game is on Early Access.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-23T04:00:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ba/9ba1ca210274a9309ec8d4b86b69b261.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Duaik Entretenimento", "Reload Studios"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Duaik"], "esrb_rating": null}
