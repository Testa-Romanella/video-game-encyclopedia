As the newly promoted commander of a combat vessel, you must lead your crew through operations in the outskirts of the solar system.<br/></p>\n\n\r\nWidespread use of high energy signal jamming and stellar phenomena have rendered most guided weaponry useless. Direct your own fire control and intercept hostile projectiles with the Mk1 eyeball.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounter your opponents by issuing tactical maneuvering orders in real time. Exploit blind spots and weak points, or simply evade incoming attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalyse and adapt to different opponents. Talk, navigate or fight your way through encounters, but beware; retreat isn\u2019t always an option, and mistakes can cost you dearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom performance optimizations to design, this game is intended to be enjoyed on a mobile device first.
