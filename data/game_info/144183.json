{"id": 144183, "slug": "the-machine", "name": "The Machine", "name_original": "The Machine", "description": "<p>The Machine is my\u00a0first game so I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>The game features beautiful pixel art and animations with\u00a0376 hand drawn sprites. The sprites will scale well, (in other words,\u00a0the graphics will look best) at the common 16:9 resolutions. If the resolution is a multiple of 320x180 then the art and animations\u00a0will look best. This includes 1280x720, 1920x1080,\u00a03840x2160, etc.</p>\n<p>The game features chiptune (8-bit, old-school) music from the brilliant\u00a0Eric Skiff. With 10 tracks from Eric's album Resistor Anthems, your ears will be entertained throughout the entire experience.</p>\n<p>The Machine is about attention to detail. That lever looks like it opens the door to the exit but it really closes the door indefinitely (at least until you restart the level). You'll have to think carefully before taking action. The game is about understanding and reverse engineering The Machine to make your way to the exit.\u00a0The levels escalate in difficulty fast so you'll feel like a genius when you finish the last one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ac/8ac657f2dd77cb933d68222e336b768b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Indi Kernick"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
