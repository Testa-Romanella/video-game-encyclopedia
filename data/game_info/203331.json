It came in a pack of games for the Mac, many of which I spent hours playing. More than that, this game touches on how I used games to let me escape from the troubles of real-world problems and get lost in another reality.</p>\n<p>emulating bugdom was quite fun. especially modeling and texturing the squirrel, it was pretty fun to mess around and make something wonky/low-res on purpose. On the other hand, baking textures and just texturing stuff in general was a pain in the ass.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/670/6707d038102b36bab32542c0a7eb347c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kariomart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
