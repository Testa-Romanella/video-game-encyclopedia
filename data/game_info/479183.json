If you're a fan of portal, you'll love this game.</p>\n<p>*Disclaimer* :\u00a0The production of this game was entirely done in a week for Brackey's Game Jam 2020.2</p>\n<p>As you traverse through your space ship, you must unlock each door to get to the next room. How do you unlock these doors?\u00a0 Well, in order to solve each puzzle, you realize you must go back in time to look for clues, get past debris, air holes, and many more obstacles.\u00a0\u00a0You must use your rewind ability, watch your oxygen levels, and health simultaneously as you try to solve our puzzles. And YES, every puzzle is solvable, don't give up.\u00a0Even if it means that you must \"trap yourself\" in the present state ;)</p>\n<p>There are many different mechanics in the game but we didn't make a tutorial intentionally. We want YOU to figure out how your ability works &amp; how to solve our 10 puzzles.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>E - Interactables</p>\n<p>Q - Rewind</p>\n<p>TIPS:</p>\n<p>A lot of things in the game are interactable, which includes the following:</p>\n<p>Buttons |\u00a0Switches\u00a0 | Turret Switches | Cubes | Symbols | Oxygen &amp; Health Packs</p>\n<p>When you use your rewind ability, after moving in the past you teleport back to your original position in the present.\u00a0This is key to solving some levels.</p>\n<p>Turrets are activated in the present but deactivated in the past. Unless you turn them on in the past ;)</p>\n<p>While in the past, your ships hull isn't breached, which means you don't lose oxygen while you're in the past. This is key to managing your oxygen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hull Breaches decrease your oxygen loss rate substantially.\u00a0DON'T GO NEAR THEM in the (present state).</p>\n<p>In order to get access to some cubes you must use a cube (maybe even multiple)</p>\n<p>Creators:</p>\n<p>Jake Ritz &amp;\u00a0Eli Paulk</p>\n\n<p>Music made by:</p>\n<p>A.L.L.I.S.O.N - Arthur Tessier</p>\n<p>Above are 2 out of the 10 soundtracks we used for this game.</p>\n<p>***THE MUSIC IN THE GAME WAS NOT CREATED BY US****</p>\n<p>Total Track List</p>\n<p>Blue\u00a0Eyed Ghost</p>\n<p>Hyjal</p>\n<p>Wave</p>\n<p>Cure</p>\n<p>Horizon</p>\n<p>Haze</p>\n<p>Degradation</p>\n<p>Childhood</p>\n<p>Fantaisie</p>\n<p>Subtract</p>\n<p>We wanted space vibes for our game and we reached out to an artist by the name of\u00a0A.L.L.I.S.O.N.\u00a0Arthur gave us permission to use his music in our game since we have no intent of selling it on steam or other platforms.\u00a0We just wanted to make this game for the game jam and for fun!\u00a0We have proof via email and Instagram of him giving us permission if anyone has an issue with it :)\u00a0He also can't wait to try it out!\u00a0He was stoked that we wanted to use his music!</p>\n<p>His Instagram: @alison_sythns</p>\n<p>I'd highly recommend listening to him. To my knowledge, his soundtracks are available on all platforms.</p>\n<p>SFX attributions:</p>\n<p>All sound effects do not belong to us; however, they are royalty free and we also edited some to our liking.</p>\n<p>Fun facts:\u00a0</p>\n<p>When we built the complete game for the first time, nothing worked.\u00a0Builds do not like OnValidate() functions!</p>\n<p>Enter into the DEV MODE!</p>\n<p>At the main menu, if\u00a0you press shift, backspace, enter simultaneously, you enter into DEV MODE. Entering into dev mode, you don't lose oxygen and all doors are unlocked. On your numpad, each level is assigned to the corresponding number. Level 1 = 1 on the numpad. 0 is level 10.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game has roughly 2000 lines of code across 27 scripts!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T09:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d5/8d5dc497b3bd2dfced63c37fe75dcd7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Jelli Studios"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
