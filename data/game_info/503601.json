Each loop iteration decreases your health, and you'll have to start over again if your healthbar reaches zero.<br/></p>\n<p>Join one of the goofiest and cutest characters ever created in a short platformer and puzzle game about finding freedom!</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Move your character around with A and D or with the keyboard arrows.</p>\n<p>Use your action by pressing space. Your action will change upon use, following a loop pattern. Each time the loop is repeated, you'll lose a battery. Try to think before you act!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T08:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f39/f39d0c5fe71111ada714113437bf4194.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Carlos Manuel Pozuelo - Pink shard games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
