A game that involves driving around, painting the ground, and battling it out with other drivers. Think if Mario Kart and Splatoon had a cross-over. Making this game for One Game a Month I knew I wouldn't have enough time to put in everything I want to, so I'm releasing this as a full demo that you can play! I plan\u00a0 on working more on this in the future, with much more content including:</p>\n<ul><li>More maps!</li><li>More items!</li><li>More car types! (Heavy, Middle, Light)</li><li>Local Multiplayer!</li><li>Whatever bugs you all find...</li></ul>\n<p>*Note: If you minimize the window at any time during a match, the match will immediately end. Sorry. :(\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs, like the game, or just want to tell me what you had for lunch today, leave a comment below. I appreciate it! (Even the lunch thing)</p>\n<p>Try playing with more teams and larger team sizes for complete mayhem! <br/>*If you play the small battle room with the full 12 cars... well let's just say there will be a lot of damage.<br/></p>\n<p>Happy racing!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff2/ff26c19f833b014bca121b44bd91db0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["rdkrause"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
