Players score points by clicking on the targets as they spawn. Once a target spawns it has 3 seconds before it disappears. Once a target disappears the player loses one of their 3 lives. Once the player has run out of lives the game is over and the score is displayed. The longer a player can last without losing a life will directly affect a score multiplier.<br/></p>\n<p>\tDuring the game a player can pause the game and start over if they want. The player can also change the color, shape, and size of the target, as well as making it spin. The player may also change the speed of the game with a slider on the bottom left. \r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T15:33:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/978/9782635f996f47b67ec899cfbf8d7655.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brandonhunt"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
