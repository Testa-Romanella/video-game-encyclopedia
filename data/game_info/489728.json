Pressing Escape will bring up the TIC-80's built in menu - this should also not be considered part of the entry as it cannot be modified.</p>\n<br/>Known issues<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Boz can sometimes teleport through chickens when pushing against them</li>\n<li>The ball can sometimes be teleported away when jammed into a corner by a chicken</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T04:12:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/853/8538e51bdf865cc6919c1196e54d2087.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["jf1x", "Larner"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
