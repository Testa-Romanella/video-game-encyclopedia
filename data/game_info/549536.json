Repair broken turrets to destroy the bots before they reach your base! Then use the kits they drop to build more turrets and repair the laser tower and destroy the enemy base! Good luck!</p>\n<p>Bug: There is a bug that shows you need 150 of each kit to win, this is a bug! You only need 50 of each (i.e. you need to drop the number of kits required to 100 for each type)</p>\n<p>There is also no menu cause we ran out of time on that one and forgot about it xD</p><p>Controls: WASD to move engineer.
