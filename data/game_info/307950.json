She whom you love is waiting alone and terrified. Abandoned? The task is simple, make it home to her alive.</p>\n<p>This game is difficult. The concept is simple. Get from spawn to the exit. However, it's not a straight run and gun. Your cannon rotates around your ship and you have to time your shots. Plus, you only get five rounds for each level. Fear not, you can reset the level if you run out of ammo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-08T06:17:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3df/3dfc617ef5b1f84bd352bf76889e94f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DigitalSnow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
