It will be a series of \"True crime\" mysteries with an irregular periodicity. The cases are around 60 pages long and are based on classic pulp magazine crimes. This series revisits them transforming them so that they can be played as a Special Agency Case: characters, locations, plot, motivations, conclusions... a unique style that picks up the ways of True Detective. The first issue of this series is #1 The Swamp: six pre-generated characters, twelve witnesses and suspects, three blueprints, 16,000 words and 60 pages.<br/><br/> &lt;<in 1968=\"\" 1969,=\"\" a=\"\" agents=\"\" alienated=\"\" although=\"\" american=\"\" among=\"\" an=\"\" and=\"\" are=\"\" as=\"\" bodies=\"\" charge=\"\" city,=\"\" culprits.=\"\" deaths=\"\" escape?=\"\" everything=\"\" evidence=\"\" finding=\"\" for=\"\" implicated,=\"\" in=\"\" is=\"\" killer,=\"\" memphis.=\"\" midwestern=\"\" motive=\"\" move=\"\" mundane.=\"\" murders=\"\" near=\"\" occur=\"\" of=\"\" one=\"\" or=\"\" pile=\"\" points=\"\" same=\"\" seems=\"\" soon=\"\" succeed,=\"\" swamp=\"\" tasked=\"\" the=\"\" them=\"\" they=\"\" this=\"\" through=\"\" to=\"\" two=\"\" up.=\"\" will=\"\" with=\"\" witnesses=\"\" woman=\"\">&gt;</in></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T11:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d75/d75a203a30725bd352d5e1256ae58fc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Juancho Duma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
