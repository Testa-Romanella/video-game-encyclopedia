It's not anywhere near finished , and it's not anywhere near what I want it to be- but despite that , I am still proud of it . <br/></p>\n<p>I'd like to thank the LazyDevs discord community for helping me out , and MedievalMore for the incredible card art once again .\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'll likely make a post-mortem and will update the page when it's made . If\u00a0 anyone is interested in any of the techniques I used for animation I'd be more than happy to share them , flick me a message on twitter any time .<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><strong>Made in about a month in Pico8 by Louie Chapman\u00a0<br/>Gorgeous card icons made by MedievalMore</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T16:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ac/2ac31970bf0d5a1d36d87b011bd815d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Louie Chapman"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
