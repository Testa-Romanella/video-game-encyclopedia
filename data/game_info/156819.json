Jump through the trees to catch flies and keep your health high. But do not fall out of the trees, gravity is not your friend.</p><p>A simple action/platform game based on the classic Atari 2600 game, Frogs and Flies. Nothing too complicated, just beeps, boops, and chunky pixels. Made as a first experiment with Phaser, and therefore it is most definitely rather rough and unpolished.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:21:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf4c059ee81c0cda97375ea35a49b8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PicoFoundry"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
