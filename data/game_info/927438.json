Why is the PC version paid?\r\n</p>\n<p>Because I need to pay the bills (in the future).\r\n</p>\n<p>2. Why is the Android Version free then?\r\n</p>\n<p>ADS.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. Will the game be released on other platforms such as Steam, Google Play Store and Apple App Store?\r\n</p>\n<p>It really depends on its performance here at itch.io, but I do wish to release them there one day, at the very least\u00a0on Google Play Store.\r\n</p>\n<p>4. Will the game be updated regularly?</p>\n<p>I don't usually update my games, but since this is my first commercial game, I think I might make an exception.</p>\n\n<p>Developer Comments:\r\n</p>\n<p>Hello everyone! This is my first commercial game, so go easy on me (laughs).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think the game turned out pretty well for such a short development time (2.5 weeks). That's right, 2.5 weeks! It may seem short, but I really tried my best to complete this game.</p>\n<p>It's pretty obvious, but this game is inspired by classic horror arcade games such as Granny and Evil Nun, so fans of these games will probably enjoy it.</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope that fans of the horror genre will enjoy what I have developed.\u00a0Also, all ideas and suggestions are welcome and greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n<p>Tips:\r\n</p>\n<p>NOTE: Lower game graphics if there are performance issues. (REMEMBER: You can also disable reflections and shadows in-game) (Most shadows are disabled at LOW graphics quality)</p>\n<p>1. You can hide in lockers.\r\n</p>\n<p>2. The enemy can only see its front.\r\n</p>\n<p>3. You can hear the enemy. (Remember to wear headphones!)\r\n</p>\n<p>4. The enemy can hear you. (Be careful!)\r\n</p>\n<p>5. There are 2 escape methods. (For now, at least)\r\n</p>\n<p>6. \"Walk +\u00a0Crouch\" to reach greater heights! (Especially when you can't jump)\r\n</p>\n<p>7. Remember! You can always try custom difficulty settings! (Yeah, I suck at game balancing)</p>\n<p>8. There are objects in objects! Get it? (No? Don't worry, you will, someday...)</p>\n<p>9. YOU CAN NOW ENABLE RETRO SONY PS1 / PSX GRAPHICS! (I used to play the original\u00a0 Sony Playstation back in the day, those were good times alright)</p>\n<p>10.
