Through advances in technology and magic, its inhabitants created a harmonious society, rid of disease, destruction and evil. All was well within the land of Aer... Until the Shadowlord came. Once a mere man with a voracious thirst for knowledge and power, the Shadowlord explored where no other dared, forsaking his humanity for absolute control. Summoning forth creatures of evil and attracting the most despicable of men, he created a powerful army and conquered Aer, engulfing it in pain, suffering and death. With the populace kept weak and divided through brutality and fear, few dare to openly challenge his reign. But now, The Council of Five, a leadership of Aer\u2019s wisest rulers and mages, has selected a powerful general to unite its people and challenge the Shadowlord\u2019s rule.
