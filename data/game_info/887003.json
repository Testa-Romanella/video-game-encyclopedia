Therefore, you're hacking a Penth Hexagon using some retro-style hacking device with bright green consoles. <br/></p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>The in-game manual could be enough for some players, but it leaves a few aspects undefined on purpose. If you don't want to fill the gaps on your own, here is a short overview about how this game is intended to be played. In a sense, it is a spoiler.</p>\n<p>Every level (called <em>component</em>) consists of some encoding machine. It turns the text input into some encoded output. For instance, you run it with \"hello\" and get \"ohell\" as an output.<br/></p>\n<p>To clear a level, you need to decipher the <em>access keywords</em> (encoded keywords). You do that by typing the non-encoded (original) keyword into the <em>input</em> text field.<br/></p>\n<p>How would you know what to type in there? This is an actual gameplay: you need to figure it out on your own. You have an encoder simulation device at your disposal. It can encode any input using the same algorithm that was used to encode the keywords. The encoded keywords are listed in the right section of the interface. You can try to backtrack their transformations individually.<br/></p>\n<p>The text input is controlled as you would expect it: type some letters in, remove text with <em>backspace</em>, move the text cursor with <em>arrows</em>. <em>Enter</em> runs the simulation with the current input value. <em>Space</em> pauses the simulation. <em>Tab</em> toggles between the normal and terminal modes. <em>Escape</em> always works as a \"go back\" button.</p>\n<p>You unlock new terminal features with your game progress.<br/></p>\n<p>The progress is saved automatically.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>There is no \"credits\" screen anywhere in the game, please see CREDITS file for license-related information.
