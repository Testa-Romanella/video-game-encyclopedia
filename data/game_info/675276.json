Deleted the locker background.\r\n </p>\n<p>-<strong><em>(NOT A UPDATE BUT)</em>Beta Version 1.0.3</strong>: Had to be taken down for a few days to be fixed fully in the backdrop transitioning and movement bug. As such, animations for the Avatar are removed (sad). Fortunately, it was just an error that I made and was fixed quickly and the locker background was uploaded again.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>-Beta Version 1.0.31: Smoother animations for walking and the (not telling you) key animations added. Now with the usage of arrow keys!\r\n </p>\n<p>-Beta Version 1.0.4: Wow it's god and a spirit. Place of worship added. Pray that this game goes viral. More bugs fixed btw.\r\n </p>\n<p>-Beta Version 1.0.5: Yay posters\r\n </p>\n<p>-Beta Version 1.1(finally)[had to skip a few versions]: Yay now finally have the EWC, easter eggs, and a start-up menu.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>-Beta Version 1.1.1: EWC OFFICIALLY K\u00d8MPL3TE!
