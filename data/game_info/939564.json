Understandable, but what happens next on the planet you landed on will change you forever.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Check out Nobuyuki's music here!</p>\n<p>https://nobuyukijohnson.bandcamp.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T19:38:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e24/e24b9e5519adf0023a8355dcd3b90789.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yerboi1995"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
