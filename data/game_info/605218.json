The only way to reach the top door is by the incomplete ladder.\u00a0In order to receive the missing piece\u00a0of the ladder to reach the door you\u00a0have to destroy the black void in which is\u00a0shooting the fire balls at you. The key will help you along the way.\u00a0If fire balls are coming from two locations;\u00a0use x and up arrow to destroy the different voids. This game is only a prototype; and I am not completely sure what I want to do with it yet. Suggestions/Likes/Dislikes on this project\u00a0are appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T09:10:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ee/5ee4cf19e82be2a3a78dfc2f711f141d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vince1102"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
