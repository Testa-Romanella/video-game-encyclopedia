And it's also the first chapter of Don Potato's adventures. I used sprites and randomly generated environments instead of tiles for the procedural levels for this.</p>\n<p>It may change or become something else. There are many features like upgrades that I didn't integrate.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T04:40:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd3ed6c310099de27151fc539759c63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 184, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["DonPotato'sGameLab"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
