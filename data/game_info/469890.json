Just kick back and hopefully you will enjoy it. As it's very early access, I\u00a0am focusing on trying to hone in on the interface and menu. Any hints/ideas/etc. are welcome\u00a0in the comments below. Expect a lot of tweaks, revamps, and optimizations as it goes. I\u00a0am working with the aim on not inadvertently\u00a0invalidating prior save games.</p>\n<p>Intro<br/></p>\n<p>You awaken unsure of where you are, or even who you are. Something has gone wrong, as your entire body screams in agony. The area you are in, is in ruin but is the world?\u00a0Will you be able to\u00a0piece together who you are? Where you are? Why do so many people seem to know you? Why don't you recognize anything or anyone? Can everyone be trusted? Are any out to play you for their own ends? Will some be out to ruin you?<br/></p>\n<p>Background</p>\n<p>This is an interactive fiction game created using Twine and Sugarcube. Currently it is just the prologue (maybe 2k words)\u00a0and is to prepare for Chapter 1. As an interactive fiction, this\u00a0game is\u00a0somewhat on rails; you will be along for the ride but will be able to customize the MC, some\u00a0NPCs, parts of the world, and some freedom in how to react to situations. A 'Character Profile' develops and will track some personality decisions,\u00a0as well as how other NPCs might perceive you.\u00a0There may even be some romance options in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>As of right now, there are\u00a0no 'your character is dead'\u00a0game over screens. It wouldn't make sense for that in the prologue, and I\u00a0don't anticipate it happening at all. It's not a choose your own adventure, per se, so you should be able to get to the end. But who will survive? Will you leave the world a better or more chaotic place? Do the ends justify the means? A\u00a0snarky retort to a sarcastic character\u00a0might be just what is needed to motivate them that a gentle word won't. Irritate or anger them and they might just decide to\u00a0plot to get you. Everyone has their own motivations, and they won't all be yours.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Saves (in-browser or offline) are stored in the browser cache.
