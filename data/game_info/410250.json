To that end, the two players, each on their phone, have to pick up the broken pieces of the porcelain objects and put them together. Each player sees half of the shards with textures and half as silhouettes. The second player sees the opposite. Players can only move their own textured pieces, so they have to cooperate to solve the puzzle.</p>\n\n<p>Credits :</p>\n<p>Lucile Cossou - Programmer</p>\n<p>Damien Blanchard - Programmer</p>\n<p>Mina Perrichon - Art\u00a0director\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin Poirier - Game designer</p>\n<p>Eddy Briand - Game designer</p>\n<p>Paul Waline - Sound designer &amp; Composer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:42:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07f/07f5e4da0a4edf5c024a38e187faa303.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LLucile", "mina mina"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
