You can use any key on your keyboard to attack, but beware, it can only be used once! That is, unless you kill enough lost souls to gain it back!</p>\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<ul><li>Press any key that isn't grayed out to move to that key's position</li><li>Kill ghosts to fill your control bar</li><li>When your control bar is green and you hear the alert press \"Ctrl\" to regain control of lost keys</li><li>Regaining control will allow you to proceed to the next wave and will reset your special keys.</li><li>If you loose control of all your keys or run out of health (Shown on space bar) it's a game over!</li></ul>\r\nSpecial Keys:\r\n<p>Some keys behave different than the rest, these are called \"Special Keys.\" Special Keys are powerful tools, however, they can only be used once per wave so use them when they are most valuable</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Control:\u00a0</strong>Pressing control when the control bar is full allows you to regain all deactivated keys and progress into the next wave.\u00a0<strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0You don't always have to press control as soon as it's activated. Moving to a better position before pressing it can give you an advantage.</li><li><strong>Shift:\u00a0</strong>Pressing shift will allow you to randomize which keys are usable on the board. *Ahem, It shifts keys around.\u00a0<strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>You will still have the same number of active keys when this is done</li><li><strong>Alt:</strong>\u00a0Pressing alt will alternate which keys are active. All deactivated keys will become active and all active will become deactivated. Use this one carefully!</li><li><strong>Space:</strong>\u00a0Pressing space will vanquish all ghosts and give you some health from each one slain.\u00a0<strong>Note:</strong>\u00a0The amount of health you get back varies\u00a0based on the selected difficulty level.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T04:00:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe4759a73e823643aca2888b3f53e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Zacksly"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
