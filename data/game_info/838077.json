Basically, the robot finds the shortest way to his goal but he can't see wood + touching wood kills him. So you have to move metal boxes around so that his shortest path to the goal doesn't make him touch wood.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T19:11:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e0/8e0e305830d0b72aa62d85741f477671.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["234zu"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
