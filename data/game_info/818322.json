Beating up Enemies does not deal Damage but rather fills your Dicometer. Roll the Dice to unlock Weapons and Magic to defeat your enemies and reach the end of the Game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>How to play</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Beat up Enemies to fill your\u00a0<em>Dicometer\u00a0</em>(The blue Bar under your Dice Tray). Hit Enemies to fill your\u00a0<em>Dicometer\u00a0</em>and level it up. When pressing \"Q\" you roll the\u00a0<em>Dice</em>. The highest number you can roll is based on the Level of your\u00a0<em>Dicometer</em>. After rolling your\u00a0<em>Dice\u00a0</em>you can unlock a Weapon for a Short Time. Now go and defeat your Enemies!\r\n</p>\n<p>BUG: When rolling a 1 you have to restart (Die) because you cannot unlock a Weapon nor reroll.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game was made by two people in 48 hours.\r\n</p>\n<p>While all of the Background Assets were premade, Characters, Enemies and Animations were made by us.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Environment Assets:\u00a0https://anokolisa.itch.io/high-forest-assets-pack\r\n</p>\n<p>Alagard Font:\u00a0https://www.dafont.com/alagard.font\r\n</p>\n<p>Sounds:\u00a0https://vfx.productioncrate.com/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:12:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/884/88418297285320ccc8d74b6e89fdf806.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lohegrim"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
