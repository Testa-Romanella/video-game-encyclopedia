Players must dribble and pass the ball towards one end of the field and try to score a goal by forcing the ball into the opposing team&#39;s net. When the player&#39;s team has the ball, the player can either dribble the ball across the field, kick the ball towards the goal, pass the ball in the air to another team member, or kick the ball forward in the direction that the player is currently facing. When the opposing team has the ball, the player can switch between different team members on the field, or slide kick their opponent to dislodge the ball from their control.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-24T07:54:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Genesis", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["SEGA"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["SEGA"], "esrb_rating": null}
