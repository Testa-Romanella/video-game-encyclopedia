Just type in a number or a word (followed by Enter) to progress through the game!<br/></p>\n<p>- Over 80,000 words!\r\n </p>\n<p>- Occasional bursts of twisted humour!\r\n </p>\n<p>- Multiple endings!\r\n </p>\n<p>- Marginally larger than 300kb to download!!\r\n</p>\n\n<p> <strong>PLEASE READ!!</strong> First and foremost, I apologise for the lack of a save feature. I have not included one due to my limited programming knowledge, and furthermore, I never expected to make the game this long in the first place!\r\n </p>\n<p>Honestly, my original plan was to make this into a simple ten minute game. One year of writing later, and it has turned into something a little bit bigger...\r\n </p>\n<p>Expect the first playthrough to last 1-2 hours long. Additional playthroughs will be subsequently shorter, since the player will (hopefully!) have a better understanding of how the game works.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-08T08:26:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb1/eb18e0f7e1379aedcdfee465297a8d35.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bobby Zeal"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
