Following the City's\u00a0expansion of urban sprawl, the player visits hand-animated vignettes of various San Marcos locations from my childhood. The only button to press is the space bar, and you only get one photo to send in for review. And finally, every aspect of the game except for the camera shutter sound effect (from FreeSound.com) was my own device, and soon there should be a full score to accompany the game.</p><p>**For some reason the game lags when watching the animations for the first time but runs just fine for subsequent runs... working on fixing that</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-06T04:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/878/878310b8534da4b76b1c72531c2e3095.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["bostonmoreland"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
