Well, this is a game largely based on such nonsense and the madness that only comes from the mind of an ADHD 5 y/o girl.<br/><br/>This pinball / billiards hybrid game challenges you to send a rotund unicorn around a randomly generated maze to eat all the cupcakes and rack up the points! The game is never the same twice and is effectively INFINITE!<br/><br/>This game is still in the early phases of development. Many more features to come!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T05:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f43/f43623303ee0be43a5edadd0ed9eaf2c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PunkyRoo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
