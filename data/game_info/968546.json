Think of it as a scare simulator. Don't expect a storyline; just one primary challenge: DON'T SCREAM. It's simple enough for anyone, even your mom. Seriously, challenge your mom to play!<br/><br/>If you scream, you restart. DON\u2019T SCREAM is an Unreal Engine 5 short horror experience inspired by '90s camcorder found footage. Made by two indie devs. The challenge is simple: explore the mysterious Pineview Forest for 18 minutes without screaming.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, right? But there's a catch. Time only progresses as you move, and you cannot predict the scares. You must calibrate your microphone in-game so that every whimper, jump, or even a minor squeak is registered as a scream, increasing the challenge. With dozens of dynamic scares, each playthrough offers a unique experience.<br/><br/>It\u2019s the perfect game to scare the pants off your friends and family. Our lead playtester (also my wife) is currently in a clinic recovering.<h3>MICROPHONE REQUIRED TO PLAY</h3>DON'T SCREAM challenges not just your nerves but your voice control. Here's what to expect:<h3>1. Calibrate Your Microphone:</h3>Set it up in-game. It's not just tech setup; it defines your challenge. A mere squeak or quiet gasp should be flagged as a scream, causing you to restart.<h3>2. Mind Your Voice:</h3>You can talk during gameplay, but keep it low \u2013 slightly softer than normal. Too loud and it\u2019s game over.<h3>3. Play Fair:</h3>You could bypass calibration to shout through scares, but it'd spoil the thrill. For a genuine horror experience play as designed.<br/><br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: WE ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY UNDERWEAR THAT MAY BECOME UNUSABLE SHOULD YOU PLAY OUR GAME.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-02T07:53:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e20df41efd40b6568acbdbf378e15045.jpg", "website": "https://justdontscream.com/", "rating": 2.62, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "beaten": 11, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 8, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 8, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joure & Joe"], "genres": ["Indie"], "publishers": ["Joure & Joe"], "esrb_rating": null}
