You will fend off the many entities trying to stop you. Collect the rhombic shards spread across the different worlds to purchase upgrades and equip more powerful weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn a departure from the typical shoot'em up, Kestrel does not force the auto-scroll mechanic that is present in the majority of the genre. Patience and strategy win out over speed and brute force. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith over 50 upgrades and infinite lives, Kestrel puts you in a position for success. A top down shoot'em up with bullet hell and RPG elements, Kestrel attempts to scratch an itch that you might know you have.
