{"id": 456641, "slug": "dungeon-escape-itch-ezspecial", "name": "Dungeon Escape (itch) (EZSPECIAL)", "name_original": "Dungeon Escape (itch) (EZSPECIAL)", "description": "<p>Dungeon Escape is a simple Zelda-like game (dungeon component) developed for a master's thesis. The purpose of hosting the game on itch is to collect player data so that I can research ways in which to adapt the game to a specific player type. If you're interested in helping, please follow the steps outlined in here. While you can play the game for however long you want, helping me should only take about 15 additional minutes.\u00a0<br/></p>\r\nGame Mechanics\r\n<p>The game can be played with keyboard or with a Xbox compatible controller, please unplug non Xbox compatible controllers because they interfere with the game and cause the character to be stuck walking in a direction. You can use non Xbox controllers with software that emulates their behavior (joy2key, DS4Windows, etc.). Also, there's no mouse support in the game, menus cannot be clicked.</p>\n<p>The game features combat rooms and puzzle rooms. In combat rooms you have to defeat all enemies to progress, while in puzzle rooms you might need to reach the exit blocked by the pots to progress. Please note that in puzzle rooms, the darker floor tiles are obstructions to the pots but not to the player.</p>\n<p>The objective of the game is to get to the stairs on each floor, the game continues <strong>infinitely</strong> through procedural generation of the dungeon floors. The floor layout is generated to resemble labyrinths so dead ends exist and serve no purpose other than to sidetrack players.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>\n<p>WASD / Arrow Keys -&gt; Walk<br/>Space -&gt; Attack<br/>ESC / P -&gt; Pause/Unpause<br/>Enter -&gt; Select Menu Option</p>\n<p><strong>Xbox controller</strong></p>\n<p>DPAD / Left Stick -&gt; Walk<br/>Start -&gt; Pause/Unpause<br/>A -&gt; Attack / Select Menu Option</p>\r\nHow to help my thesis!\r\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br/>Download the game (Windows or Linux)\u00a0and play until you game over or are done with the game (the game never ends, if you want to quit you can safely close the game window).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br/>Inside the game folder you downloaded, a \"<strong>UserLogs</strong>\" folder should be created. If, for example, you played on the 15th of May at 15:00 then you should see 3 files named \"2020-05-15 15 00 00 GUID.txt\", \"2020-05-15 15 00 00 Log.csv\" and \"2020-05-15 15 00 00 ProcGen.txt\". I need you to email those files to \"ei11056@fe.up.pt\" with the subject \"[THESIS] Player logs\".</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 (and final!):</strong><br/>Answer a questionnaire about the game experience. For this, you need to open the \"2020-05-15 15 00 00 GUID.txt\" that contains the <strong>play session ID</strong> which is important for the questionnaire to identify your play session.<br/><strong>Very important:</strong> for each time you press \"Start Game\", the game generates a set of 3 files, the questionnaire is about a specific play session which your <strong>play session ID</strong> identifies. This means that your opinions should be focused on that specific play session.<br/>You can find the questionnaire here: https://forms.gle/rT87vePLgCpxJEdz5</p>\n<p>You can email me the files and answer the questionnaire for each play session you created (set of 3 files inside \"UserLogs\").</p>\r\nClosing Remarks\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully go through the entire process to help me out. I know the process isn't the most streamlined it could be, it's really appreciated!</p>\r\nDisclaimer\r\n<p>The data collected is completely anonymous and will only be used for research related to my thesis. The play session ID is needed to link the files you send me to a questionnaire but is otherwise non-identifying.</p>\r\nSpecial Thanks\r\n<p>All assets are CC0 and are linked here, along with the playlist that helped me learn how to code for Unity.
