More playable characters and new dungeon floor types are currently being planned for future free updates, so keep an eye out in the future! We appreciate the feedback and will use it to improve the game even further.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Dungeons of Alethrion</strong> is a dungeon crawler roguelike game based on the YouTube animated series <strong>Tales of Alethrion</strong>! Play as epic heroes from the show, each with unique abilities. Play it alone or grab a friend to help you tackle the dungeon chambers in adventurous couch co-op!<br/><br/>Randomly generated layouts and different environments will make each dungeon floor unique so that no adventure will be the same as the one before. You'll vanquish enemies that will drain the <strong>monster meter</strong> to open up the dungeon exit. Collect treasures along the way, but watch out for bosses that want to squash you! <br/><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Wilhelm</strong> -  A legendary vampire swordsman. He moves quickly and fiercely in the dungeon chambers thanks to his ability to turn into a dark cloud and pass right through the monsters lurking about. <br/></li><li><strong>Vito</strong> -  A legendary mage that holds the power to vanquish large groups of enemies with his powerful spells that he can shoot from a distance.<br/></li><li><strong>Gaya</strong> - A powerful forest nymph, able to fend off enemies harnessing the power of nature! While running, she can leave behind a vine wall, perfect to make enemies easy targets for her wind gusts and powerful lightning!<br/></li><li><strong>Tira</strong> - A skillful assassin with an arsenal of blades at her disposal. Enemies will be overwhelmed by her flurry of attacks, and her backflip makes her quite elusive as well. She can even throw kunai while airborne!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li><strong>Cadaver Crypt</strong> - A regular floor that is full of zombies and some spiders. Later floors will have different types of zombies, big and small. It's also the home to animals you can recruit as pets, like wolves, bobcats, and lynxes. Throw them some zombie meat to tame them and have one at your side. <br/></li><li><strong>Enchanted Library</strong> - A regular floor that takes place in a magical library that the gargoyles and wisps call home. The magical wisps look small at first, but they can fuse together to create a much more agile form! Also on this floor is the blaster wolf, a pet you can tame with magical fruit you find. <br/></li><li><strong>Spider Nest</strong> - A boss floor that is inhabited by numerous spiders, most notably the Spider Queen! She's a ginormous beast that will follow you and make sure you pay the price. Cocoons full of baby spiders are also present here. <br/></li><li><strong>Spectral Sanctum</strong> - A boss floor that is ruled by the Elder Gargoyle. A fancier version of the library, this floor lets the Elder show off his abilities, like creating the wisps! Stop the mastermind behind it all. Or is it just an illusion..?<br/></li><li><strong>Treasure Floor</strong> - Take a it easy with a treasure break! Grab as much as you can, and there's no time limit so take your time. The shopkeeper is common here so spend your treasures on some goodies!<br/></li><li><strong>Bonus Room</strong> - This extra room can be found from a treasure exit or by using a magical warp flute item. Although these rooms are small, they have the best treasure in the game. Some rumors say that the fairy goddess was spotted here!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Play as one of the four heroes from the epic webseries, Tales of Alethrion! Wilhelm, Vito, Gaya, and Tira are all playable. <br/></li><li>Have a friend join in local co-op play.<br/></li><li>Soundtrack with remixes based on songs from the show. <br/></li><li>Monsters from the show along with brand new ones, like the Elder Gargoyle and many minions.<br/></li><li>Detailed pixel animations and unique tilesets for the various floor types.<br/></li><li>Wild animals you can tame to join you along your adventure.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>P.S.
