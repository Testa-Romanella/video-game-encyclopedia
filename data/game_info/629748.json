{"id": 629748, "slug": "zweite-kasse-bitte", "name": "Zweite Kasse, bitte!", "name_original": "Zweite Kasse, bitte!", "description": "<p>Hello there!</p>\n<p>In Zweite Kasse, bitte! you're a cashier in a busy supermarket, doing your everyday work. Today however, there seem to me a lot more customers than usual. Might it be the special deals? As per supermarket lore, having to open a second cash register is shameful and disproves your ability to handle your job well. It's you against the time.<br/></p>\n<p>That said, try to type in as many words (customers) as possible before the queue gets too long. Should it reach that point, it's \"Zweite Kasse, bitte!\"<br/><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the miniBeansJam 7 (\"Night genug Zeit\", or \"Not enough time\") within 48h. As I had to work over the jam weekend, I had little time to actually create something, so I decided to go with the meta approach of turning my work (which made me not have enough time) into a minigame that somewhat suits the topic, in my opinion at least :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits </strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>[Code]</strong> Sebastian B\u00e4hring<br/><strong>[Sprites &amp; Art]</strong> My lovely girlfriend who did not want to be named<br/><strong>[Ambient Sound]</strong> \"People at the supermarket ambience\" via mixkit.co<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T14:08:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e54/e54dff4208e136695d61499ca1b2b723.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Yauxo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
