I love Spaceteam, but it gets boring pretty quickly and the text is a problem for kids and non-english people. So I wanted to make something a bit deeper: a small adventure with some simple naval strategy and tactics.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tCommunication is a key part. Needing to work together is what <em>can</em> make this game great. You'll be with a group of friends, each with the game on their phone. You join the same ship and have to fight enemy ships. On your vessel are 4 cannons, one helm (to control the ship) and one scouting position at the top of the mast. That's it for now while testing the basic gameplay.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tSteering the ship at the helm is important. The cannoneers can only aim the cannons up and down -- not to the sides! So the ship's side has to face the enemy as often as possible. When at a cannon your view is poor, so you don't know what's going on everywhere else. The scout can help with that. He has a good overview of the situation from the mast and can tell the cannoneers when to switch side and can tell the captain when a ship is pulling up behind them.</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>In this video I recruit some AI pirates for my ship (pretend they're other players) and fight the enemy ships. In the end I tweak some variables to change the water.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tto do\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>explain the different parts of the game.
