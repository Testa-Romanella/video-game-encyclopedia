The game consists primarily of collecting gacha toys and battling with them.</p>\n<p>Upon its initial release the game received mediocre reviews from critics and very little advertising. Due to these circumstances, it was not commercially successful, although it has gained a cult following with numerous high fan reviews. Capcom themselves seem to consider the game as one of their favorites, as the official Japanese website is stocked with concept art, videos, and screenshots of the developers messing around. There is also a toy and manga line in Japan though it is extremely rare.</p>\n<p>In March 2012, Capcom reprinted copies for the GameCube in Japan 9 years after its original release, which stirred talk of a possible future sequel to come. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2003-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:40:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa4/fa45f711fc7219da981a40e209d69e1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["GameCube"], "developers": ["Capcom"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": null}
