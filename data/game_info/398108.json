I have been a software developer for more than ten years now and I want new challenges, while reviving my passion for gaming.<br/></p>\n<p>Play the game and try to reach dungeon 25!</p>\n<p><strong>Please leave a comment and rate this game!</strong> Any Feedback helps me really a lot!<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>But don't forget<strong>:<br/></strong><strong>THIS IS A PROTOTYPE!</strong> It has bugs and not much content.</p>\n<p><strong>Sound recommended!</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Mechanics:</strong></p>\n<p>In every dungeon you need to find the stairs to the next one. The deeper you get, the more dark and dangerous the dungeons become. Find items that help you with fighting enemies or finding the exit. Every five dungeons there is a safe room (violet floor) where you can activate a shrine to set a checkpoint and spent skill points. When you die, you'll be resurrected here. You'll lose your items, experience and unused skill points though. Go back to where you died to reclaim everything.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Move: arrows keys, wasd or left side of screen on touch devices<br/>Attack: space key or right side of screen on touch devices<br/>Use stairs/use shrine in safe rooms: E or click/tap<br/>Use pathfinder: Q or click/tap in the items bar</p>\n<p><strong>What I want to work on next:</strong></p>\n<p>Better GUI/Sprites: Currently almost everything you see is taken from itch.io's assets section. Since I'm a developer and not a designer or pixel artist, I could need some help with that.<br/></p>\n<p>More enemies/traps/puzzles: Currently there are only snakes, a deamon guarding the stairs, flamethrowers in the walls and a time bomb. The game needs many more types of danger. I'd also like to implement some puzzles that need to be solved in every dungeon before you can go further. In general... more content!</p>\n<p>More narrative: The narrator needs to say more and actually tell a story.</p>\n<p>Mana/Spells: Currently there's only the sword. More ways of attacking enemies are needed.<br/></p>\n<p>World Record: I want to keep track of a global record for the deepest dungeon some reached.<br/></p>\n<p>And I have a lot more things on my list, to make this an actual game worth playing.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T04:27:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b6/7b6cd0aef965cab492616cd503f19a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["mkt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
