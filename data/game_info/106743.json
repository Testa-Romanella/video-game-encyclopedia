Unfortunately, it has affected poor Ky, who has nothing to do with the curse. So of course, she must find the source, but so many people need help, and just what can she do? Well, she simply must help! From person to person, she goes. Of course, it's all optional. If she so pleases, she could go straight to the source of her trouble, but it's so hard to say no to the people. The wood cutter, the apothecary, the kitten enthusiast; so many people needing so much help.<br/><br/>For the Winterruption game event, I can assure you that there are no dragons, or trolls, or succubi, or any sort of whimsy in this game. It's quite as serious as you please, thank you very much. If you play the game straight through, I dare say that it might take as few as 5-10 minutes, but if you give the side quests your full attention, who knows how long you might be delayed, and that would be terribly inconvenient, would it not?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ebb/ebb1faa81d26f13304a8914dc782faaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pianotm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
