This mod is based on cartoon animation \"LEGEND of KILLY WILLY... (Poppy Playtime Animation)\" by Gametoons and also inspired by this mod\u00a0https://gamebanana.com/mods/342042\u00a0 and this one\u00a0https://gamebanana.com/mods/342214. It's technically part of MAIN mod https://gamebanana.com/mods/285137. For covers I used FL Studio for Killy Willy and UTAU for Player. By the way, noises that Killy Willy made in his episode was not been good for cover so I used voice of Hypno from GT episode so technically Killy Willy is Hypno.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Fla and Samples are available.\r\n</p>\n<p>Alternative link:\u00a0https://gamebanana.com/mods/344273\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T06:04:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4a2/4a274d8491584e290d53b2ca43a62b3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiamGlow"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
