Dark Force has been completely destroyed and the constant turmoil that has plagued the Algol system is now gone (...or is it?). What has become of the world?</p>\n<p>On the planet Motavia everything was as it should be. The ancient technologies that had caused so much havoc were once again hidden from the human eye and temptation. A new political order has settled in society. In addition to this new society, a new type of ore has been discovered and a new organization, The Defenders, emerge. (A rough translation of the original Russian description.)</p>\n<p>Hahn has continued his work as a scientist, and has risen to being Director of the Academy. He has done a lot of growing up following the end of Phantasy Star End of the Millennium. No longer needing to hide behind Lyra/Alys' skirt, he has become a man in his own right. Expanding beyond biology as his sole scientific expertise, he played a large part in the construction of a hydro power station that is far more than it appears. He has not neglected his combat training either, becoming quite effective at destroying machines.</p>\n<p>Incredible experiments are being performed somewhere in the world. Science has advanced far beyond what was conceived in the basement of Motavia's academy. Bio-monsters have begun to reemerge. If it isn't Dark Force making his regular return to destroy the Algol System, where would these monsters come from? More than that, a way to resurrect the dead has been discovered. How can these things even be related to one another?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is not only the familiar faces moving the world this time. A young woman named Emma is in training with The Defenders. Our prototypical good-for-nothing heroine is kept in line by her older sister Jain, a full blown Defender. Emma is such a hard worker that she doesn't see anything wrong with lazing around outside for a few days while their job waits for them. It will still be there a few days from now, won't it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twenty Years Past explores the future of the world after PS4, bringing back some familiar faces to tell a new story in the changing Algol system.<br/>Music album<br/>- by Lokatorhttps://lokator-studio.bandcamp.com/track/living-planets-voice-in-space</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4b5/4b5e4ad448ae37e5a27c3eceac436614.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Retroreloader @ Return learn games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
