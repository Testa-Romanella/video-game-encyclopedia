The follow mode was only available on enemies and enemies followed the target using the shortest line segment. The new script will allow any attached game object to be moved.<br/></p>\n<p>1. Player guns overheat. If fire button held down player fire rate slows linearly until max firing delay is reached after 5 seconds. If mouse button is released fire rate will return to normal.</p>\n<p>2. Accuracy rating display. Accuracy is calculated as hits / shots fired by player and is updated in real time!\u00a0Accuracy affects the score multiplier.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. Dynamic environmental obstacles - Flying asteroids that will periodically fly through the game screen and smash anything in the way</p>\n<p>4. Dynamic enemies: Enemies that move in circular orbits and sinusoidal pattern s making them hard to hit.</p>\n<p>Also enabled collisions for enemies so that if player\u00a0runs into enemy sprites they will take damage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-04T12:06:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45f/45ffd651dfce6abb2664528135e68342.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SerenDipity"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
