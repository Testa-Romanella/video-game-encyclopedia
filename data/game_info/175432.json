Delgado is on a mission to retrieve Fatherbean's hat which was stolen by some very bad beanos.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to beat all enemies and pass through all obstacles in the level. The task is made harder by optional targets that you can shoot at to gain points and by various quick-death scenarios (rising water level, waves of fire, being targeted by mortars). Those mechanics try to constantly keep you on the move.<br/></p>\n<p>The lower your final score, the better. The final score is calculated using passed time, from which your points (gained by killing enemies and shooting targets) are deducted. If you score below a certain threshold you will be awarded a gold medal. Beating one level unlocks access and story of the next level - beat all levels to win the game. Try to unlock all achievements while you're at it.</p>\n<p>While you play the levels, the story happens as a series of conversations.<br/></p>\n<p>There is a tutorial level available. In the tutorial, Commander Josh will explain to you how to play the game and control the character.<br/><br/><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>arrow keys - movement</p>\n<p>ctrl - shoot weapon / throw grenade<br/></p>\n<p>space - jump</p>\n<p>escape\u00a0 - pause<br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:\r\n</strong><br/></p>\n<p>  Programming and assets not mentioned below: Mikolaj Panasiuk\r\n  </p>\n<p>Music: \r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Coolbeans Theme \u2013 Polybius (https://soundcloud.com/user-641624452)</li></ul>\n<p>Sound FX : \r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>Gunshot sounds \u2013 Game Audio GDC Bundle (https://sonniss.com/gdc-bundle-license/)  </li><li>Explosion sound - https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/explosion-10070/  </li><li>Pain sound \u2013 thecheeseman (CC License) (https://freesound.org/people/thecheeseman/sounds/44430/)  </li></ul>\n<p>Models:\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>M4 and Grenade - 7XF Design (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/guns/modern-weapons-pack-14233)   </li><li>Medieval cannon \u2013 art georg (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/medieval-cannon-61834)  </li></ul>\n<p>Fire and Explosions: Unity standard assets\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df5/df5e4b0afeac753fbae028d8d1bb9b13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["grzala"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
