Every year, the tribes would send their best hunters to compete against each other in a test of skill, endurance, and strength. The winner of the Great Hunt would be crowned the champion and would lead their tribe for a year, commanding the respect and loyalty of all the other tribes. But there was also a darker side to the tradition; the tribe whose hunter performed the worst would be subjected to a sacrifice. The stakes were high, and the competition was fierce, but the glory of being crowned champion was worth it all. This year, the Great Hunt would test the limits of the hunters and determine the fate of the tribes for years to come.</p>\n<p>Though cheating and killing was forbidden, some hunters resorted to these tactics to win. The stakes were high, and the competition was fierce, with hunters plotting against each other and constantly on guard. This year, the tension was palpable as the hunters gathered, each with their own agenda, setting the stage for the deadliest Great Hunt yet.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS<br/></p>\n<p>- Slug hit - 1 points</p>\n<p>- Slug kill - 3 points</p>\n<p>- Bat kill - 5 points</p>\n<p>- Hunter kill - ?? points<br/></p>\n\n<p>KEYBOARD</p>\n<p>- WASD or ARROWS KEYS to Move</p>\n<p>- J to Fire</p>\n<p>GAMEPAD</p>\n<p>- LEFT STICK to Move</p>\n<p>- X to Fire</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Developer: @arielsan</p>\n<p>Music by @esti_uy\r\n<br/></p>\n<p>Asset pack by @penusbmic <br/></p>\n<p>Extra props assets by @pencilwing and me<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T22:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/10f/10fabda5c8605c6c3d6a03ded45aa108.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["arielsan"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
