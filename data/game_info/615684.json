It is a top-down dungeon crawler type game, heavily reminiscent of the DOOM series. It consists of 3 levels, all to be completed as fast as possible sequentially. Other than that the only way you'll find out about it is if you download and play it now!</p>\n<p>Thank you to anyone who has downloaded it and played it, I hope you enjoyed it for the 6 minutes of gameplay that it gives you :)\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T07:09:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d3e/d3ea892c2debaf81cc47aec9c0590bc7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BIGDUGGAN"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
