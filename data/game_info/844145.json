{"id": 844145, "slug": "wrist-lock", "name": "Wrist Lock!!!", "name_original": "Wrist Lock!!!", "description": "<p>Face to face*, engaged in relentless battle over control of the computer's mouse. A fierce push-pull that turns into a pull-push and back again. After the dust settles, after many lives have been lost - who will come out on top? Who will be declared the victor of <strong>Wrist Lock!!!</strong>?</p>\n<p><strong>Wrist Lock!!!</strong> can best be described as a tug of war platform fighting game. Both players place their hands on the computer's mouse and try to drag the mouse-controlled enemy monster towards their respective character. Once their character jumps and lands on the monster, THEY are the ones who become mouse-controlled, and it's an opportunity to bounce off of the opposing player's character to reduce their life meter to zero - but! It's also the other player's chance to drain THEIR opponent's OUCH meter by having them land in the same place where the enemy monster lays stunned. And if neither manages to seize victory before the timer runs out, they're in for an explosive finale...</p>\n<p>Want to make a game easier or harder to win for one player? Want to make a game winnable in only one specific way? The amount of lives and ouch meter for each player, as well as the timer, are adjustable - including the option to make them infinite.</p>\n<p>For those not interested in using the mouse, the game allows use of the keyboard arrow keys and the left thumb stick of an X-Box controller. There is also an option to turn on visual assistance that will provide text-to-speech on the menus and in-game sound cues to help players know if they are above the enemy monster or the opponent.</p>\n<p>Grab a friend, both of you grab a mouse**, and play <strong>Wrist Lock!!!</strong> today!!!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This game is local multiplayer only. There is no single-player mode.<br/></p>\n<p><em>*while keeping an eye on your screen or monitor<br/>** or keyboard, or controller as outlined above</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-29T17:57:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/780/780b4be5d38f4dd2555b90510ed3872a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 121, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scroungin' 4 Catsup"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
