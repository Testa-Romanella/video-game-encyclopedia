The game is best experienced with little beforehand knowledge so I will keep this brief. This game is a work of fiction, taking place in a fictional setting and forgoing realism. However, some of the events in this experience are based on very real truths and events of the past. This game is somewhat experimental in nature so feedback is appreciated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T15:17:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69f/69f572f44334a1f958b3e378234e1ccb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Superporkchops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
