The world was saved\u2026 or so it seemed. Whilst keeping a low profile, Elleria began to notice strange occurrences \u2013 ominous dreams, a persistent weakness, and mysterious portals coming out of nowhere. <br/><br/>Before long, she and her allies find themselves in an alternate timeline \u2013 a timeline where events took a grimmer and more depressing turn, with familiar characters no longer being the same, and Elleria herself being at the centre of it all. <br/><br/>Wanting nothing more than to simply return to her home timeline, Elleria will have to face her fears, her lineage, and herself, in order to overcome treacherous hazards, eldritch secrets, fallen angels, overwhelming odds, and maybe, just maybe, save others in the process. <br/><br/>To check out the original Atonement title, please head on over to the existing store page: http://store.steampowered.com/app/385070/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-17T06:54:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d45/d4547085e475bd136f8c80449f22fbdc.jpg", "website": "http://www.newrealitygames.co.uk", "rating": 2.11, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 11, "owned": 366, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 34, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 337, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astronomic Games"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["New Reality Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
