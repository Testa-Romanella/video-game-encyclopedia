However, there is a catch, every time the hero lands on a dice it loses on hit point. Once. dice loses all hit points, it disappears, soo keep an eye on the dice number.</p>\n<p>To call these magical dice, the player will have to ring the bell and summon the hand! The hand will toss the dice, and if the hero does not like the resulting configuration of dice, they may ring the bell again to clean, and again to have the hand throw a fresh set of dice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Beware Though! There are a few hazards in Dicey Deeds, avoid goblins and avoid falling into pits.</p>\n<p>The music was accessed legally via soundstripe.\u00a0The artist is Nu AlkemiSt. The sounds were also accessed via soundstripe.</p>\n<p>Here is my twitter for those interested in following me there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is my first GMTK game jam entry that I have actually finished.
