Currently it is still in development and we\u00a0would love any thoughts and feedback.\u00a0All that's required to play is two\u00a0controllers (PS4 preferred), though any controller type should work, and speakers or headphones.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This demo contains the multiplayer sewer level with four spells from the pyrology spell school. You battle your opponent and the first to three kills wins. While you are free to traverse the level at your leisure you can only harness the power of the beat to unleash spells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spells can be chained together. What does this mean? So if we have the following four button spell combos ABAB\u00a0\u00a0and ABCD \u00a0(imagine these are different buttons a controller). We can cast both these spells in six beats pressing ABABCD without skipping a beat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To protect yourself you can equip a shield, which will dispel any lasting effects such as burning and protect you for a limited number of beats. Try to use it sparingly though as you won't be able to use it again for four beats, and it will prevent you from casting.</p>\n<p>The basic controls for currently are (based on a PS4 controller)</p>\n<ul><li>Movement - Right Stick or Directional Pad</li><li>Shield -\u00a0\u00a0Shoulder Triggers</li><li>Spell Casting - Triangle, Square, Cross and Circle Buttons</li><li>Quit - Keyboard Escape Key</li></ul>\n<p>For this demo the spells available to you are:</p>\n<p><strong>Ember Burst:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Day Break:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cinder Wind:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Cauldron Bomb:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>We would appreciate any feedback you may have after playing the game, and have prepared a short survey that you can choose to answer.\u00a0\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckglUevKu_hE5p8ok0qMoccrO45v6s3zuXL7IK7Y19jnpq8g/viewform</p>\n<p>THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/907/907a74ba84054f31e794301a1de257db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Inner Circle Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
