He is trained by the famous sensei Makai, with the aim of not only mastering the art of the sword, but also to master the great power ruling the whole world: the \u201cElements\u201d. No one has ever been able to master them all, in fact, their power used together, is able to bend something even far beyond Makai\u2019s abilities: the \u201cSoul\u201d. Sadly, not everyone in the society sees the elements as a means to protect or to build. The \u201cKusho\u201d organization seeks their power to rule over the whole world. Thinking that Makai holds the answers to their quests, they end up killing him. Kukiro is now alone, just a young boy left in the middle of his training and without someone to guide him away from a path clear in his mind: vengeance. In this prototype, start experience the use of the kunais, as they will aid you in your quest: learn how to use the elements to move in the world with some tutorial maps and see how they will come in hand in your future adventure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Movement:</em> WASD</li><li><em>Kunai Shoot:</em> Right mouse button</li><li><em>Melee:</em> Left mouse button\u00a0</li><li><em>Jump:</em> SPACE</li><li><em>Select element: </em>MouseWheel or 1,2,3,4</li><li><em>Teleport to previous/next checkpoint:</em> K or L</li><li><em>Interact/enter door:</em> F</li><li><em>Restart Game: </em>P</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Team Members:</strong></p>\n<ul><li><em>Filippo Guadagnini</em><br/>\n</li><li><em>Iacopi Regoli</em></li><li><em>Simone Abate</em></li><li><em>Vanessa Tamma</em></li><li><em>Huo YiYing</em><br/>\n</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T10:43:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bec/bec6a9b413c668fee392af760fde39e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["POLIMI Game Collective"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
