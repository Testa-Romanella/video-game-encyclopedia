The specifications were that it must be fit for mobile and must follow the theme \"Start with nothing\".\u00a0</p>\n<p>I decided to fulfil these conditions by making the game very simplistic and in portrait to fit the mobile theme. And to fit the start with nothing theme I added an upgrade system so the player... starts with nothing.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0didn't create any of the assets but they were free to use. The sound effects were also sourced online and were free to use. However, I did create everything else from scratch including the music.</p>\n<p>I plan to use this as a prototype and keep working on it with the hope of publishing the full game on mobile.</p>\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>- Issue with collisions when starting a run</p>\n<p>- Soul absorb upgrade 2 appears to do nothing</p>\n<p>- Cannon upgrades appear to do nothing however, they decrease the reload time. This will be made clearer in future updates.</p>\n<p>- Speed up curse doesn't always speed the ship up as intended</p><p>- Exit button doesn't actually exit the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T09:39:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eea/eea91f07d4aec3adac9c351509cc8380.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sam98js"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
