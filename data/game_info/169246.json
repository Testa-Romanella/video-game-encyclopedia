You can grab powerups to help you and slap\u00a0the other players around, but can you outwit and out-slap your opponents? Good luck.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0made this game for my <strong>1gam </strong>challenge for the month of May, 2018.\u00a0 I\u00a0was the solo developer and used some free art assets available at opengameart.com and the Unity Asset Store.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls are detailed in the game. This is a local multiplayer game, so you can either have 2 people on the keyboard and 2 people with gamepads or all 4 people on gamepads.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a WebGL version and a Windows version. \"Escape\"\u00a0key brings up the pause menu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please let me know what you think. This game was inspired by an old childhood favorite of mine. Can you guess which one?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc1/bc10cc0e92eb26f5f375fdbd571d74dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ventedpennies"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
