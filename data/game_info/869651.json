In this puzzle game, you slide blocks across a grid to group them together by color to dissolve them. Once you clear all blocks of all colors, you move on to the next puzzle. The concept, though easy to grasp, becomes increasingly challenging as additional mechanics get introduced over time. The catch? There is no \"undo.\" Train your abstract thought, your observation skill, and forward thinking to elaborate a sliding plan and anticipate the outcome of your actions. Or you can retry from scratch and find the winning recipe in incremental steps. <br/><br/><strong>Slide, Group, Dissolve:</strong><br/>Slide cuddly, squishy blocks around to dissolve them and progress<br/><br/><strong>4 colorful biomes:</strong><br/>Unlock your way across colorful environments as you clear puzzles<br/><br/><strong>160+ puzzles:</strong><br/>Solve 160+ puzzles of varying complexity and difficulty<br/><br/><strong>Discover:</strong><br/>As you advance, tackle new puzzle mechanics and see how they change your gameplan<br/><br/><strong>Train your Forward-Thinking muscle:</strong><br/>Think, visualize and slide.
