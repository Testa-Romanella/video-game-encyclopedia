In an instant, the lightning traveled from my console to my controller before it finally got me! Everything around me seemed to become bigger, what was going on?! I couldn't move my body, out of control I started to move along the cord of my controller until I finally hit the console, everything got black\u2026<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>When I woke up I was in a familiar, but yet strange environment. Something seemed different, for some reason, I could only move in two dimensions. That\u2019s when I realized it, I was trapped inside my old favorite game!</em></p>\n<p>Enough with the cheesy story, Project Forward Scroller is a First-Person Platformer game in which I wanted to explore an old idea I had for a game. The idea is best described as a side-scrolling platformer viewed from a first-person perspective. I wanted to keep the mechanics from old side-scrolling platform games, while also trying to maintain their atmosphere. The game world is in 3D, but you can only move in 2D. I worked on this for 10 weeks as my final assignment at my school FutureGames. I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a1/2a16dc7ade38c62a48f514ec79431fd6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tobias Nylin"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
