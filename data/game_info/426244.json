This game has hand-drawn sidewalk chalk visuals to coincide with Silverstein's infamous verses. I hope you enjoy playing\u00a0this as much as I enjoyed making it! A huge thank you to Siobhan Gibson,\u00a0my fellow classmates, and my good friend Shel Silverstein.</p>\n<p>Soundtrack: \"What did I do to be so Black and Blue\" by Louis Armstrong</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T02:38:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/896/896aa40cbbd2adb804d50a3b46fa4c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knox's Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
