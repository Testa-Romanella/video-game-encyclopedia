You can drag them across the canvas or put them in a jar.</p>\n<p>In the left panel, there are five tools that help in the game. The first one adds health when you hover over the player, the second one erases the jellies (carefully, if you erase 15 pieces, you will lose), the third one - the jar-moves the jelly automatically to the jar, the fourth and fifth change the cursor.</p>\n<p>Be careful - jelly can teleport from the jar!\u00a0The marmalades are teleported out of the jar, but this can be controlled by tapping on the hand that sometimes appears above the jar. It will help to detain the most frisky of the jams for a while.</p>\n<p>You will win if you survive a wave of 150 jellies, but you will lose if the player runs out of lives.<br/></p><p>--&gt;\u00a0Made for Scribble Jam: https://itch.io/jam/scribble-jam</p><p>Limitations of jam:</p><p>- scribble/doodle<br/></p><p>- All text in game must be a made up language</p><p>Thanks for playing :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T14:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af44ec6b16a5e16e55edb5026bba7c69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Game Sunlight"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
