The design fiction was about exploring the question of\u00a0 'what would our world look like in the near future if the global surface temperature heated up by 2\u00b0C?' and\u00a0how this would impact our coral reefs through ocean acidification and coral bleaching. It consisted of three artifacts under a scuba diving company called Among Lost Paradise,\u00a0one of which was a VR simulation of what the experience would be like to wear the diving mask. The mask has augmented reality technology integrated in it to cloak over the bleached coral, though the technology is (intentionally) not perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This can be played without a VR headset (you can move around the level using WASD, however <strong>it will not look the same as it does in VR\u00a0(fog colours disappear and glitch effects do not appear in this mode)\u00a0\u00a0</strong>and the movement is intended to only be at the teleport points set in VR. To see what the experience would look like in VR, please watch this video:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-10T03:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7ba/7ba57f0e98ad4c04ddf4bdabcc61711f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 162, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JacazzaJade"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
