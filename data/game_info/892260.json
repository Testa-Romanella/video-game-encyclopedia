People are always on a search for a new challenge, but one person goes to the extreme. They have traveled throughout the world until they have stumbled upon Keylite\u2019s Dungeon. The dungeon crawler has passed away when trying to clear the dungeon, but has gained an infinite number of lives as a possessed suit of armor. The player will travel through the many levels of the dungeon, collecting keys along the way to open up the way to the end. The player is encouraged to explore and find secrets across their journey. Maybe they will find enough to become the ruler of Keylite\u2019s Dungeon\u2026</p>\n<p>Note: Ladder is only\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Navigate menu with arrow keys and space to select\r\n[W] - Interact with sign\r\n</p>\n<p>[A] - Move Left\r\n</p>\n<p>[D] - Move Right\r\n</p>\n<p>[E] - Interact with weapons on ground\r\n</p>\n<p>[Shift] - Dash\r\n</p>\n<p>[Space] - Jump / Double Jump / Wall Jump\r\n</p>\n<p>[Esc] - Pause\r\n</p>\n<p>[R] - Quick Reset\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Project Managers\r\n<ul><li>Alexander Lee\r\n</li><li>Vikas Mejari\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Artists\r\n<ul><li>Alexander Lee\r\n</li><li>Andrew Boban\r\n</li><li>Luke Dujmic\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Programmers\r\n<ul><li>Vikas Mejari\r\n</li><li>Andrew Boban\r\n</li><li>Alexander Robinson\r\n</li><li>Luke Dujmic\r\n</li><li>Vikas Mejari\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Other\r\n<ul><li>Tile Set got from David G\r\n<ul><li>https://incolgames.itch.io/dungeon-platformer-tile-set-pixel-art\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Music from Alexander Nakarada\r\n<ul><li>https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com/royalty-free-music/celtic-fantasy\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Sound Effects from various creators\r\n<ul><li>https://pixabay.com/\r\n</li><li>https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/metal/\r\n</li></ul></li><li>Background from TexMexxx\r\n<ul><li>https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/7wdjye/occc_parallax_background_for_my_dungeon/\r\n</li><li>Messaged and got permission from the creator\r\n</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Post-Mortem\r\n</p>\n<p>\u2014\r\n</p>\n<p>\tDuring this project, our group encountered a lot of ups and downs when creating Keylite, but the main problem we had was time management. We never planned any time to meet and solely work on our game. We always procrastinate till the last minute and the game never got fully completed like we wanted. We planned for there to be 5 different worlds, but had to cut 4 of them out and only have a dungeon world simply because we did not manage our time correctly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\tSome of the ups that we had were being able to effectively get the amount done in the few days we gave ourselves. We were able to split up the work decently so that everyone had something to do when we were working on the game. We successfully completed the first world of Keylite except for the boss.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T10:13:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce9/ce9af6d696323c010bd28e16a6a5eb10.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Keylite"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
