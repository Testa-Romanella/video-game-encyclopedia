This is a small vignette about being on a dark train at night and the shapes made by lights passing the window. </p><p>I've never really done anything before using 3D lighting or Unity's inbuilt animation system, so this was just a small test to learn that stuff. I might come back and do more with it in the future. I like the idea of having to try to read a book in this annoying light or something.</p><p>Mouse to look. Escape to quit. </p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #9 or 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/58c/58c713e547473e667a41279b70ccf328.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
