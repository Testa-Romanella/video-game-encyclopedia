You also control a cube. Each face of the cube has a different power. They are useful. It's also in space, because space is cool. <br/></p>\n<p>I recommend checking out the\u00a0How to Play section\u00a0and\u00a0playing the Free Play mode to get a feel for how the game works before jumping in to the main game. <br/></p>\n<p>This game is a work in progress. Currently there is a Free Play mode, and two levels (subject to change)\u00a0in the main game. I will update with more levels as I make them, with more enemy types and powers. As you'll notice, two of the cube faces\u00a0  don't have any powers. If you have any ideas for what they could be, as well as other ideas for enemy types, obstacles, light puzzle ideas etc (or a better title), please let me know in the comments.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits: </strong></p>\n<p>Title font: Cube by Fenotype (dafont.com)<br/>Electronic Videogame Music by DHSFX (Unity Asset Store)<br/>Starfield Skybox by Pulsar Bites (Unity Asset Store)<br/>TZ_Futuristic Panel Textures Lite by TeenZombie Software (Unity Asset Store)<br/></p>\n<p>Sounds:<br/>Door unlock:\u00a0DoorSet by qubodup (opengameart.org)<br/>Powerup: SoundPack01 by wobbleboxx (opengameart.org)<br/>ShootingSound by B.M.G (Unity Asset Store)<br/>Projectile impact: Myself<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T03:43:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/daa/daafbddf17b9db52e76cde02ab0338d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["James27"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
