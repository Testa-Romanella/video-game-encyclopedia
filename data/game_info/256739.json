The Theme was swipe. I just wanted to get my feet wet in unity and sprytile using the tiles from a previous game i made called Ulma.\u00a0 You play as a rival tribesman from the Tiger tribe attempting to steal (or swipe) treasures from the bird temple.  Future planned functions were: a character select screen that operates like Tinder complete with character profiles. you would swipe right on the character you want to play. Available charicters would have been: chibi laura croft, indianna jones, carmen sandiego, and perhaps the swiper form Dorra the Explorer. I had lots of other levels in mind as well as hazards and things to avoid and simpler key based controls <br/></p>\n<p>you control the character with the mouse and WASD keys. The mouse rotates the character. left mouse button jumps.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0f/e0f078eb417253a4ab9467bb1e520347.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["geekdude"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
