{"id": 397728, "slug": "tortolian-tourney", "name": "Tortolian Tourney", "name_original": "Tortolian Tourney", "description": "<p>Tortolian Tourney is a 2 player competitive racing game inspired by the classic 3D racing game Sonic R, originally launched on the Sega Saturn. Play as sea turtles who suck at swimming and make your way under waterfalls, across suspended bridges, and through volcanic valleys. The best part is, you get to eat donuts while doing so! The more you eat, the faster you go. Use items to annoy and slow down your opponents; pick up lifebuoys to swim faster in water. Your lap times are recorded so you can see your improvements, as well as how fast you beat your opponent by. To simulate the best racing experience, Tortolian Tourney\u00a0 is controlled via joystick controllers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-13T02:54:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/826/8261f30450cd8f855c965702e7d4b3f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arjun Jaishankar - Game Design Student"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
