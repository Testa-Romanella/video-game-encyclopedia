Collect Carbomite from fallen foes to power up your primary fire or to fuel your super weapon!</li></ul><br/><br/><br/>Starr Mazer: DSP was born as a passion project during the development of its bigger brother, the point-and-click SHMUP hybrid, Starr Mazer. Originally, Imagos Softworks teamed up with veteran development studio Pixeljam to craft a demo environment to test weapons, enemy attack patterns and space combat. When both teams couldn\u2019t stop playing the single demo level they designed, they knew they were onto something very, very special. <br/><br/>Shortly after, Don Thacker and Miles Tilmann started working tirelessly to crack the code and turn the little demo into a unique fully featured experience. After playing Rogue Legacy, Don was inspired to craft an elegant roguelike game loop to add a refreshing update to the shooter genre. Thus the DSP MkI Corp was founded and a perilous battle that pitted thousands of pilots against the G\u2019ell invasion was born!<br/><br/>A unique game mechanic alone isn\u2019t enough to be memorable. So to bring the world to life in stunning pixel art, the team enlisted Starr Mazer art director Maximo V. Lorenzo, lead artist PixelPiledriver, background artist Christopher Pariano and programmer Justo Delgado Baud\u00ed. Arcade High also joins with an intense synthwave soundtrack to round out the experience and take what was once a single demo test level into a fully realized shoot\u2019em up experience!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hi there! It\u2019s Dan, Playism\u2019s senior content manager. Starr Mazer as a whole is a project I\u2019m very close to and I wanted to say a few words about it.<br/><br/>A major cornerstone of my video game experiences growing up was sitting in front of the TV playing hours of Life Force, R-Type and Gradius. What enraptured me about these games were the stories they told in their boxart, levels, the kinds of enemies that appeared, the bosses and the way they implied humanity\u2019s imminent extinction. These were stories that not only came alive in my imagination, but that were also clearly communicated in pixel art that was not always so clear. Despite low-fi graphics, the experience was profoundly hi-fidelity.<br/><br/>It was a trend that I didn\u2019t feel followed the genre as a whole. Cave took SHMUP story-telling to new heights with Mushihimesama and Death Smiles; Treasure did so with Radiant Silver Gun and Ikaruga. However, I felt the stories in those games came across quite differently as my attention was drawn toward moments and bullets rather than stages and bosses. Impressive as they were, my focus was simply on other things\u2014like not dying horribly.<br/><br/>As I came to know Don\u2019s work in film, such as his shorts and feature length film, Motivational Growth, I understood where Starr Mazer: DSP\u2019s strengths in story came from. And talking with him about classic and modern games I finally understood how Imagos Softworks and Pixeljam were seamlessly blending modern roguelike designs with old school, horizontal, SHMUP story-telling.<br/><br/>Starr Mazer: DSP will be my first personal experience with Early Access and I\u2019m thrilled to see where this adventure goes. I can\u2019t wait to undertake it with you.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-09T23:07:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c17/c17aa27aedb39d15d9d0a46fef4cd095.jpg", "website": "http://starrmazer.com/dsp", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 24, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 15, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 382, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Pixeljam", "Imagos Softworks"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["AGM PLAYISM"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone"}
