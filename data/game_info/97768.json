Scotch is an exploration robot designed for investigating subterranean fungus. On his latest mission he is sent into a volcano to collect samples of a strange violet mushroom, the presence of which is quite unusual for its location.</p>\n<p> On his way through the hot underground network, the volcano suddenly starts erupting! Scotch's escape algorithm is immediately initiated - you need to get him out of there!</p>\n<p>With his trusty gunboots Scotch can blast off into the air at a nausea-inducing velocity. The ammo for his boots however is scarce and he can only carry one bullet at a time, making extended mobility a luxury.</p>\n<p>You'll need to make the best out of what you have and chain your precious gunboot blasts into additional jumps, bounce off of fungal foes or go through boost rings, all while avoiding lava and bottomless pits in the game's 13 levels.</p>\n<p>Almost each level has a goodie - a shiny star collectible in a tricky spot you can try to get if you dare. Collect all of them for a special ending screen.<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the HeartJam 2018, with the theme of scarcity being reflected in the scarcity of Scotch's blast jump and the limited ammo capacity for it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Left and right arrow keys - Move left and right<br/></p>\n<p>SPACE or Z - Jump or gunboot blast if you have ammo</p>\n<p>ESC - Exit game</p>\n\n<p>pm2k - Coding</p>\n<p>HappyHead - Art</p>\n<p>Minichibis - Music</p>\n<p>Cover art by Sisi</p>\n<p>Special thanks to SAKYUBASU and Bub<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec7e9c3a1c352d7b45d96f611218aeed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HappyHead", "pm2k"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
