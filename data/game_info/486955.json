Moreover, this little game is also designed for kid\u2019s entertainment, to transform a\r\nboring painting into a funny game. During the process of experience, children will practice their\r\nimagination of painting skills. Considering children aged from 4-8 are beginners for using the\r\ncomputer, the rules won\u2019t be too complicated to understand. Parents can help their children\r\nsave the picture and print them out and keep those images as a souvenir for children\u2019s\r\nmemories.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-31T03:14:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a23/a23fb9bef619abf6cff46ff4aff42a81.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nina jiang"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
