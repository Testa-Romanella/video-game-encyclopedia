There has to be some way to escape!</em><br/></p><p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong><br/><em>The desert is a huge, hot , nasty place not built for humans. But, we are capable of surviving in harsh conditions. You must search out water, food (look for prickly pear cactus fruit), and maintain your heat by drinking to cool off. And of course... find a way out!</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong><br/><strong>Move: </strong>WASD / Left Stick<br/><strong>Jump:</strong> Spacebar / A Button (Xbox)<br/><strong>Interact:</strong> E key / B Button (Xbox)<br/><strong>Toggle Objectives &amp; Items Screen: </strong>TAB / Y Button (Xbox)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note from the developer: </strong>So this was my first solo game jam. Normally I just do art, and decided to challenge myself by doing... everything else too. I also didn't start until Monday afternoon, so I lost a good 3.5 days of development time. There's a bit still missing from the game such as voice-overs that were recorded and an in-game how to play section that would better illustrate things, as well as a few animations and sequences. I will be continuing to update this project post-submission to add the rest of the things I didn't have time for. Still, a learned A TON this week and feel much more confident as a developer.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:38:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe57f162414fd766a1ab07047c11f80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jordan Neff"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
