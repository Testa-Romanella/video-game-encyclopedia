{"id": 99717, "slug": "brottas-land-2", "name": "Brottas Land 2", "name_original": "Brottas Land 2", "description": "<p>Released after the critically acclaimed Brottas Underground but taking place several decades beforehand, Brottas Land 2 follows the continued adventures of Fatso Brotta as he once again steps up to take out the horrible bug menace plaguing his land, but this time, there's more than just a simple insect infestation to worry about. Something else is afoot in the land of the Old Maidist Homeworld!</p><p>Also, the economy has gotten way WAY better?? There's money everywhere! It's pretty great.</p><p>Brottas Land 2 improves substantially on all aspects of the original game's design. Featuring updated graphics with more than 4 colours, as well as an updated game engine (it saves!!!), more levels with more varied level design and gimmicks, as well as a full story complete with cutscenes similar to those used in the critically acclaimed Brottas Underground, Brottas Land 2 is sure to please.</p><p>The game also contains twice as many secrets as the original! Lucky you! Find them all and you might just get something special! ;A</p><p><strong>Something to note:</strong> The game auto-saves on every map screen, and no sooner!! So if you get halfway through a world and decide to stop, just remember that you'll have to start that whole world over again, even if you're near the end!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/928/92841c638c13846e046c46f46e17efab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["G0ATFAC3"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
