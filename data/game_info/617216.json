Submission to GMTK gamejam 2021.</p>\n<p>How does the game adhere to the theme:\u00a0THAEM uses waypoints to create a path for the player, which it also used to interact with enemies (bullets). The behaviour of all of the components of the game (player and the bullets) is related to the behaviour of many other components. Hence, they can be considered all to be linked together. Also, I have gotten an ungodly amount of liker errors when compiling the game, which alludes to the theme as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Made using C++ and\u00a0piksel. <strong>After the gamejam voting closes</strong>, and after I find a better workaround for one very annoying problem, I'll put the code on GitHub (with a link here, of course).<br/></p>\n<p>P.S.: Works best on Chrome / Firefox. Not so hot on Safari, alas.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T05:38:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b68/b687f4069e032b84685515e0535c5cdf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcinKonowalczyk"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
