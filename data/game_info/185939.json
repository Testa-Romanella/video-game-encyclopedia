One thing I tend to find when finding a good version to play is they tend to be very visually busy or just tiles with numbers which is why I've tried to create a minimal clean aesthetic by using only colours.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>Move Tiles\u00a0-Arrows / LMB + Drag the direction you want the tiles to move.</p>\n<p><strong>Aim of the game</strong></p>\n<p>Push two matching coloured tiles together to upgrade them. Keep doing this until you create the ultimate tile!! Or at least until you run out of moves to make.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Programming, Art &amp;\u00a0Animation: Rob Brooks</p>\n<p>Audio:\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/pro-sound-collection</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5f/a5f80faeed1dcb02ca905b3a935ff7f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RobBCreates"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
