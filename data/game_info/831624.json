After Carla is killed on the battlefield, her soul is kidnapped by a cruel god. Can you save Carla from a fate of torment?</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul><li>4 main endings (One main ending includes\u00a03 sub endings with up to\u00a03 variations of each sub ending). The best ending is extremely hard to find and the true end requires a certain action.\u00a0Note: Some sub\u00a0endings may become unobtainable depending on your actions. These sub\u00a0endings only offer minor changes in text.</li><li>Automatic puzzle completion. Fail enough times and your character may attempt to solve the puzzle themselves!</li><li>Gallery and Music Box. After completing the game, you may access the music box and the gallery.</li><li>Partially voiced. Certain key lines are voiced!</li><li>Struggle system. If you lose your MC's trust, they may attempt to wrest control from you!</li><li>Lore. Many parts of the game include pieces of lore that you may find.

We have added certain bugs to the game. On purpose.</li><li>Definitely not secretly a portal to another world that will cause your very soul to be captured by a malevolent entity of eternal torment. You are definitely playing a game and not a remotely controlled person through an interface that just looks like a game.</li><li>Hidden character. Can you find the cameo appearance? That is definitely not canon since she is from an entirely different worldset and wouldn't be able to appear in this world? Or perhaps she is just another person that happens to be\u00a0very similar?</li><li>NG+ This game has NG+. Or does it?</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T18:00:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1db/1db0b07e0278d66e55e6a3d6f16e63d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AI Sin"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
