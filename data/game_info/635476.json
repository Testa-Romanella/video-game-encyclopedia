Took a little while to make and some of the assets were free on Unity. The music is clearly not by me, but I think everyone will know the song. I made this as a present for my cousins B-day and as a project to help me learn how to make better games. I added a downloadable version as well\u00a0 just in case the browser version doesn't work for some people. On the downloadable version, it may bring up an error saying that the firewall protected your computer. I don't know why it does that, but all you have to do is click more info, and then click \"Run Anyways\". That should allow you to play the game without any issues after that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T05:23:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ae/5ae8e4e5d1942b0146aeb057fabeffde.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Nitecrwler25"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
