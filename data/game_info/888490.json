The theme for this game jam was 'Clich\u00e9s' so our clich\u00e9 was 'Shop till you drop', a game where the player will shop until they drop and cannot play anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For this project we aimed to make everything ourselves, however the character models and their animations as well as all sound effects/music we didn't make ourselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>This is our first time publishing a HTML playable file and we used Unreal 4.23 to do it. There appears to be an issue where the game has to be in full screen to work but the HTML buttons will still appear on the screen unfortunately.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Developers:</strong></p>\n<p>Giles (Level/Game Design):\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/gileswright/\r\n</p>\n<p>Leighton (Technical/UI Design):\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/leightonauld/\r\n</p>\n<p>Chris (Environment Artist):\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-pile/\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T11:30:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9c/b9c99c04a8c2cc90c0c368b9487337a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GilesGameDesign", "Axldy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
