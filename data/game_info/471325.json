Currently the game doesn't have music (waiting for DSPGraph), however try this sound while playing!</p>\n<p>This is my very first complete game made using Unity Dots, or Data Oriented Tech Stack. This allows for the writing of safe multithreaded code that can be compiled with Burst to native computer code. In layman's terms: shit's crazy fast.</p>\n<p>The rendering of objects is done via the Hybrid Renderer V2 which supports Material Overrides. All objects use the same material with their color overwritten so they can all be gpu instanced and batched together. Not specific to Dots but\u00a0again: fast stuff.</p>\n<p>All UI has been created using UI-Toolkit, which allows all UI to be drawn in a single draw call. It's just all fast, okay?!</p>\n<p>Currently the BallSystem (incidentally the most intensive one)\u00a0is not taking advantage of Dots because it needs to complete early so it can play sound. In the future I would like to play the sound using DSPGraph (Dots Audio). This is currently in development with little documentation on how to use it.</p>\n<p>Naturally with all this potential for faster / more lightweight games, I'd like to continue improving my skills with these technologies. I believe this project\u00a0to mark an important step on that path.</p>\n<p><strong>View the code for this project here on github!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-24T03:27:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4c7/4c74e4559a4a7f938f18d7c75ccca192.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CaseyDeCoder"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
