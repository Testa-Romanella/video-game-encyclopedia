Welcome in the dark with some lights which will remind you some classic real coster. <br/>Psychedelic sound, stressfull atmosphere, weird feelings, this is what we call a coaster.<br/>To prevent some comment, yes you can see pixels sometimes, but or you had pixels or you had to download 5 Gb for a roller coaster... we made a choice. <br/>Also, we made it using physical conditions, using throttle or brakes for the train, which means none of the speed you will feel is virtually made, it would be the same in real. The only differences with a real one are : no wind in your hair, and no heart attack. <br/><strong>Just have fun :D</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:02:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9fe24b9f910487d2d59c5ed14c43bfe.jpg", "website": "http://maestro-creations.fr", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Maestro Cr\u00e9ations"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Maestro Cr\u00e9ations"], "esrb_rating": null}
