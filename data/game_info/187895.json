I decided to try out my skills anyway at the ludum dare 40 compo only to realize how hard of a project this could be, I didn't have nearly as much as i was planning on adding. it has no audio or graphics just a basic unity shapes but i functions and that's all i can really hope for with my current knowledge level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36b/36bdde01410c247e6a62fed185cb4d4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nerdyreader12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
