It is a game in which you have to transform an element by using other elements to get the asked result. (If you have doubts about what's the goal of the game, don't hesitate to watch the video).<br/></p>\n\n<p>I simplified the game a lot, because the game jam's duration was very short, and I wasn't always available. I also think there are still some bugs, and I couldn't build the game in HTML.<br/></p>\n<p>In terms of design, I think it is far too easy, and i'm afraid I am not really in the theme (It's only chemistry because you have to transform elements). So, I know I could have done better, but my first idea has been cut due to the difficulty to use a plugin that would have been perfect for it. But, i'm proud to have more than 3 levels this time. Still, the main problem is that I don't know if it's easy to understand how to play without seeing the video.<br/></p>\n<p>For programming, I am not the best, but I am glad to see that I have accomplished something that is playable.</p>\n<p>For the art, the 1 bit constraint was really hard, I have done my best to have something that is understandable in terms of signs and feedbacks, for the game to be played without explanations.</p>\n<p>In terms of sound, I was working with chiptune VST for the music, but I have done something else with it, that pleased me more.</p>\n<p>So, I don't think it's my best game, but at least, it is playable, there are arts and sounds, and multiple levels that helped me improve my level design skills I think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-14T02:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/474/474e91be8330eececae9b855cb988584.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["scratchinartist"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
