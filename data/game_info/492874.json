When you click a cube, it changes its colour and all its neighbours, so to make all the board to share the same colour, you have to think in advance.</p>\n<p>The first 3x3 board is very easy, but you can select more difficult boards. Use the buttons on the top to play bigger boards or with more colours.</p>\n<p>Colours go from a minimum of two to a maximum of four.</p>\n<p>Boards go from the smallest, a 3x3 board, to a strainful 7x7 board.</p>\n<p>While the small 3x3 board offers no difficulty at all, the bigger the board the more disheartening the game gets. But if brain games are your thing... give it a try.</p>\n<p>The WebGL version have a problem with the lights, everything looks too bright for my taste, so I recommend using the PC version.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a extremely simple game I made in a few hours just to test my skill with Unity a while back. One of my very first tries with the engine, but originally developed with Android in mind. I hope you can enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-11T14:22:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/954/9545a71b1bc4b1465fc1f944965842c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Cimeto"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
