While this may seem challenging without fingers, there are portals, power-ups and brute strength on your side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gain points for every sheep you hit into a barrel within the time limit. Use portals to quickly send sheep around the map. Challenge yourself with power-ups to get more sheep spawns or faster sheep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Built in Unity. Tested to work on HTC Vive, Occulus Rift and Lenonvo MR. Supports Room scale and Stationary Standing. Please allow at least 1.5m in front of yourself and to the side to ensure safe game play.\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-28T04:18:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b58/b58e7a8f8b5a4a9b8bcf0e03d72135e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nebbia"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
