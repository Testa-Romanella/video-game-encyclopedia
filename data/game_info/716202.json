Explore 5 exciting levels, find the fastest route, grab all coins, slay all enemies and master the game!\u00a0Can you S+ every level?\u00a0</p>\n<p>This has been a short side-project I made to clear my head. Thanks to the amazing people, who provide free assets to make short projects like this possible and enjoyable!</p>\n<p>Check out the awesome soundtrack by wyver9 here\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to visit kenney.nl for kenney.nl</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing, I would apprechiate a sweet comment or a rating &lt;3</p>\n\r\nKnown Bugs:\r\n<ul><li>Double Jump cancels when at highest jump-height. It's really annoying but I can't fix it for the life of me. Just don't be too greedy</li><li>Enemies sometimes be vibin\u00a0at the edge of a platform or even fall off it. #wontfix</li><li>If the game doesn't detect any keyboard input, make sure to have the canvas focused by clicking into the window.</li></ul>\r\nTips for better scores:\r\n<ul><li>You get double points if you don't get hit throughout the entire level. It's hard, but necessary for S+</li><li>To get the time-bonus, you have to finish the level in less than half of the available time.</li><li>Take your time to familiarize yourself with the level, you can reset anytime by holding R, it doesn't affect your score. You can even retry the level to replace a score, if you didn't make it.</li><li>Level 4 and 5 are designed to be infuriating. Just keep on training that muscle memory. Also try to memorize the fake-walls by closely watching enemies and coin positioning\u00a0;)</li><li>Using Q and E for attacking can save your ass, if you have to turn around quickly to fight off an enemy.\u00a0</li><li>[SPOILERS START HERE]\u00a0</li><li>The King Hing Thing chase-sequence doesn't affect your score. Your only objective is to survive.</li><li>For the most painless escape from Level 5, hold on to the key until the very end to unlock the keyblocks below the crown. jouble and cliem are just bait and not actually needed to finish the level. Your best bet is to pick up the key right before you want to finish the level, so you don't accidentally lose it on one of the many keyblocks.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-31T05:41:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdf/cdf18bff1b95496e3e6905aa3c7a4fb2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["meloonics"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
