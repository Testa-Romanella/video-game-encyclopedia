Well now you can, get \"legless\" with a friend in a 2 player duel (local play). <br/>\n<br/>\r\nKilled all your friends? That's okay, Endless Knight also features a single player experience with 4 difficulty settings and an absurd story!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEndless Knight is a fighting game inspired by the black knight scene from the Python classic \"The Holy Grail\". The game sees you cutting opponents' limbs off in a fight to the death!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe mechanics of Endless Knight are different from that of most fighting games. There are no combos or special moves, the focus is more on reaction and blocking than attacking as failure to block will have dire consequences.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnlike other fighting games, you can continue to fight after your arms or legs have been cut off, but you might find it to be somewhat of a disadvantage.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-08T02:07:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/240a3a08be4348510afd08d5adb6d974.jpg", "website": "http://willsykesgames.com/endless%20knight.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 301, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Will Sykes Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Will Sykes Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
