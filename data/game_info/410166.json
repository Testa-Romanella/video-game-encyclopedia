This game is a two player experience where one player is on the alien planet while the other is in a spaceship in space. Some weird interference keeps them from sending the pictures of their discovery and they have to communicate to each other how each alien letter looks like, in hope to be able to translate it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T04:23:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/225/225e58cb65ff9d5fd68b94e161cc556d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hekaton Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
