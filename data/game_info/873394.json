This will save the hassle of\u00a0getting device ip addresses. Tip: use Alt Tab to switch between clients while testing.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Objective:\u00a0</strong>Your goal is to create the strongest board to defeat and outlive your opponents. Do so buy purchasing\u00a0characters, strategising their positions and ranking them up. If you run out of player health, you lose.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>D\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Roll Shop</p>\n<p>F\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- Level Up</p>\n<p>E (Over Character)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - Sell Character</p>\n<p>Right Click (Over Character) - Inspect Character</p>\n\n<p>School Duel has staple mechanics to\u00a0the autobattler genre such as Income, Tiers, Abilities, Stats, etc that are showcased in the preview video.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Notes:</strong>\u00a0This game is a prototype for a gameplay experience\u00a0I envisioned a long time ago when I was inspired by\u00a0TFT and Super Auto Pet.
