This game is, in fact a mixture of 3 of our previous hits: Infinity Loop, Infinity Loop HEX and Current Stream.<br/><br/>The Loop ENERGY environment is very relaxing and interstellar, mixing a smooth soundtrack with beautiful puzzles which will blow your mind. In fact, this puzzle game has a lot to do with imagination, design, art, vision and metaphysics.

The apparent complexity is quickly replaced by clairvoyance and that is when fun begins! In order to complete the level, you have to rotate the objects so the ENERGY can pass through them. When all the bulbs were illuminated it means that everything is connected and your work is done. <br/><br/>How many levels are there?<br/><br/>Loop ENERGY is based on a logic of never-ending levels. Knowing this, you will never get bored solving the same puzzles; there will be an infinite number of puzzles to solve and everyone will play the exact same levels: If you are in the level 1000 and someone else is also on level 1000, you will be both playing the same exact level. <br/><br/>Do I need to pay anything to play?<br/><br/>Loop ENERGY is completely free and you don\u2019t need to pay for playing the game.
