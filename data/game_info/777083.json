And the new intern, Detective Raccoon, is a young, dumb and hot-headed pizza lover who is always sniffing for ways to bend the rules.  <br/><br/>The unlikely pair have to team up this summer to explore Nut City\u2019s neon-washed streets, meet its strange citizens, and tackle bizarre cases. Danger looms around the corner, but love also blossoms.  <br/><br/>Be careful of where to look and which path to choose, because all actions have consequences. Will Captain Fox and Detective Raccoon form a deeper bond, or part ways in bitterness?  <br/><br/>The future is in your paws.<h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>Crudely drawn but still lovable pixel animals<br/></li><li>Various unique locations with secrets to uncover<br/></li><li>Casual puzzles (sorry I don't know how to code)<br/></li><li>5 comical thrilling cases!<br/></li><li>6 endings!</li></ul><h3>CONTROLS</h3><ul><li>Mouse Left Click/Space Bar - Advances dialogue<br/></li><li>CTRL - Fast forward<br/></li><li>F - Toggles full-screen mode</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-27T05:35:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3542fa801653c29537f49b03bdf2d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "macOS"], "developers": ["looking4stupid"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["looking4stupid"], "esrb_rating": null}
