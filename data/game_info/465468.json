You will have to escape from the bad guys at first, but everything changes when you pick up a Gunbox. This item will give you the opportunity to attack, but not at your desire. You will be giving a random weapon (Pistol, Machinegun, Shotgun &amp; Gatling Gun) and you will have to wait until it shoots. Try to destroy the enemies before they destroy you.</p>\n\r\nMcCaroni\r\n  \r\n<p>This macaroni is your only friend in here, and has a lot to offer. Without a gunbox, McCaroni can run to everywhere and, the most important part, roll over the enemies. Use this ability wisely.\r\n  </p>\n<p>With a gunbox, you will be able to shoot the enemies during a random amount of time. Don\u2019t trust the gunbox, therefore it could give you a bad time.</p>\n\r\nMeatBull\r\n  \r\n<p>This meatball is your basic enemy. It will roll to you without stop, and you will have to defeat him before he defeats you. Take care of yourself, a bunch of this can put you in a lot of trouble.</p>\n\r\nChed\r\n  \r\n<p>The cheese is something special. He doesn\u2019t want to destroy you, just wants to chill. But as you will see, the map is very limited, so it will be a problem in your path. You can play with it to try to avoid the enemies, but is not an ally.</p>\n\n\r\nCherry\r\n  \r\n<p>The tomato chase you as the meatballs, but be careful being near them or hitting them. When they die, they tend to explode. This will cause you some major problems if you\u2019re unable to control them.</p>\n\n\n<p>You will have to deal with difficult situations, and the fact that you have no way to attack until the gunboxes appear will generate some problems. Have fun, enjoy the game and try to resist, everything will be okay unless the situation goes out of control.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n  \r\n<p>\u201cW, A, S, D\u201d for the main movement\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cSpacebar\u201d to dodge/roll\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u201cMouse\u201d to aim</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n  \r\nTACOS ENTERTAINMENT\r\nDavid Lozano (Programmer)\r\nAdri\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez (Programmer)\r\nVictor Valiente (Artist)", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T08:58:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f17/f17f7285015098faf7ef945163e92831.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tacos Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
