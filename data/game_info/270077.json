{"id": 270077, "slug": "runnget-itch", "name": "Run'N'Get (itch)", "name_original": "Run'N'Get (itch)", "description": "<p>'Run'N'Get' is a\u00a0runner with 2 modes that suits children: an infinite run in the 'Relaxing' mode and 'Nightmare' with 9 levels each is getting harder. In the beginning you can choose one of the three characters, if you want you can change your choice every time before each run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your main goal in the 'Relaxing' mode\u00a0is to run as long as you can collecting flowers and presents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your main goal in the 'Nightmare' mode is to collect candies, fight bosses, and\u00a0complete all the levels.<br/></p>\n<p>During your run, try to avoid all the obstacles by using the game controls: arrows or WASD and 'Space'. You can avoid them by moving the character up or down the lane or by jumping over some of them (not all) using 'Space' or sliding using the right arrow. If you hit any of the obstacles, your character will lose a life. But don't worry: you can restore up to 5 lives if you gather a Heart bonus (one life for each Heart). There also other power-ups in the game which allow you become invincible, speed up or attract flowers and presents.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/450/450c0ba28911df1e661af9ef04525668.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TonAme"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
