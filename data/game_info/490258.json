Inspired by Sonic games like Sonic Rush, and Sonic Generations, as well as Rayman Legends. Nina's core is reaching the end of the level as fast as possible while looking cool and stylish doing it! Being able to run on any open wall, Nina's all about quick reaction times and maintaining your combo. I was playing Rayman Legends on one of the later rescue levels when this core concept finally materialized. The kinetic feeling I got from making it through that level was something I wanted to make a game about. This is the first Demo of the game, debuting at next weeks Sonic Amateur Games Expo or SAGE.\u00a0 Knowing that there's going to be a lot of traffic on SFGHQ I decided to mirror it here. plus you get it a day early!\u00a0</p>\n<p>lastly it's still very early in development, quite a bit may change, and if there's a bug me or my beta tester haven't found, let me know!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T06:19:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ab1/ab1c98a00407153f460983369d9cc860.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phi9009"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
