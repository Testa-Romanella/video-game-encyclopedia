It's when it truly feels alive. The rich colours of the lights, the air thick with anticipation. It's like the whole city is dancing; It beats, pulses, with energy and music. </p><p>You know that weird hour? That surreal time of the night when it feels like anything could happen. The city becomes a playground, waiting to be explored. Strangers wander the circus together, never knowing what's around the next corner. Well, this is one of those stories. This is one of those nights.</p><p>BetweenUsGame.net || @BetweenUsGame<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2e/f2e121431dda3b144aa52a01a7adb2e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["JoshUnsworth"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
