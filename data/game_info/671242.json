No scores, wins, or game overs. How you play is up to you. <em>(You can also *not* organize them and let chaos reign!)</em></p>\n<p>This game was started during The Great Chaos Jam. I wanted to make a small game that gives you a sense of satisfaction, while letting you define when the game is \"done\".</p>\n<p>I hope you have fun poking around and let me know your thoughts. :)<br/></p>\r\nFuture plans for the game include:\r\n<ul><li>Adding more variety to objects</li><li> Creating more rooms with specific themes</li><li><strong>Updating the art.</strong> The current items are drawn using Gamemaker's sprite editor, while the howto section is hand-drawn using a tablet. I plan to stick to the latter style.</li><li>I'll update this section as my wishlist grows!</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Music is called Snowfall Final by shadydave at freesound.org</li><li>Created using GameMaker Studio 2</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-01T04:39:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c044c04acf214cde0e93d7390f8c65a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["marylikesgames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
