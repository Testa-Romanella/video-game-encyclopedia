Ever.</p>\n\n<p>As you are traversing the obstacle course, every ten seconds your environment changes, adding interesting challenges. Don't touch the spiky parts and don't get stuck on walls - and most importantly: try to reach a new high score!</p>\n\n<p>Controls are very minimalistic: use SPACE to jump, or SPACE in the  air again to activate your jetpack. Move your mouse to point your  flashlight.</p>\n<p>This game was created for Ludum Dare 51: \"every 10 seconds\".</p>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T17:24:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2db/2dbd6df11ed6b28647f7256c32ab250c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["UOT Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
