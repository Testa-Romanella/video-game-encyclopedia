You feel like you are stuck for days\u00a0in this endless hallway, many strange sounds start echoing through the hallway, sometimes you even feel like someone or something is watching you.\u00a0\u00a0As you run after each rest\u00a0,\u00a0closer and closer, to the darkness at the end of the hallway,\u00a0the lights start to go off behind you, one by one. Thirsty, hungry and scared you decided to run one last time. . .\u00a0And there it was, after all this time,\u00a0a door, waiting to be opened. You felt relief, but as you open it total darkness takes over. Feeling of presence and incredible fear takes over, lights in front of you turn on showing the same hallway, but something feels different . . .\u00a0 You are not alone . .\u00a0.\u00a0</p>\n<p>-This story can end in 3 ways</p>\n\n<p>-Music and edits by Caki Bell\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>-His channel: \u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCteR5bUAR3_r2WOsKL6fF-w/featured\u00a0(He makes amazing no copyright music please check it out!)\r\n</p>\n<p>-Check out my channel as well:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCALTliI3Xg1gxOGxEn_OkzQ</p>\n<p>\u00a0Join our discord server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/ErbEJ9U</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T06:45:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26e/26e364021c31c080624d7c828f149eb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 113, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PixelSpeed"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
