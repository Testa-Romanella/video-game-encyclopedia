Even if you have a custom port set, if it fails to connect it will try to use the 2300 port by default (to help with cases of the host not understanding networking too well.)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Weapons</strong><br/>available are:<br/>1. Revolver<br/>2. Magnum Pistol<br/>3. Sub Machine Gun<br/>4. Shotgun<br/>5. Laser Gun<br/>6. Rifle (think M16)<br/>7. Laser Blaster<br/>8. Crossbow<br/>9. Rocket Launcher<br/>10. Grenade Launcher<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>is like any arena shooter, you can move around the map and pick up weapons from crates and shoot other players.<br/><br/>A player can carry 3 weapons at any time and switch with the 1,2,3 keys respectively. Picking up a weapon you already have replenishes ammo, picking up a weapon when you have a blank slot puts it there, otherwise it will replace and drop your current weapon on the field.<br/><br/>Currently there is only 1 map, which contains 3 areas, the outside, inside of a small house, and a cave that runs from the lower left to upper right. The caves and main areas can't see or shoot or interact with each other, so ambushing players is good tactic if you can predict their movement!<br/><br/>As you gain more kills, you can unlock more of the weapon list to be available as your starting weapon when you spawn.<br/><br/>You can check ping, name, and score of all connected players using the key (see screenshots.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T07:00:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d055e9030297695294fc0ef2eab6c908.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaskedIntrovert"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
