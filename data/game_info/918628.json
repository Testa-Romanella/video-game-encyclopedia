I've been enjoying a lot of illustrations with\u00a0more dramatic perspectives so I\u00a0tried replicating something to that effect with the skewed\u00a0camera placement. To further exaggerate that perspective, I\u00a0brought the hand into view where the portrait is interacting with the frame.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0placed a couple lights through the scene to both hide the absence of a background, and highlight the main geometry of the character, like the eyes and pointing finger. After posing the lights, I\u00a0added a bit more playfulness with using\u00a0the mouse to nudge the camera a bit, giving the player a more active role in observing. (though interaction wasn't necessary for this assignment)</p>\n<p>I\u00a0decided to leave\u00a0the z-fighting from the geometry intersecting in since I feel it adds\u00a0to a sort of handmade charm in 3D real-time art.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T11:37:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8e/e8e627578103f255237cfc8ba1955f77.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eastoned"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
