The goal is to reach the finish line as fast as possible while keeping most of your gold.</p>\n<p>Your magnetic grappling hook will help you to slow down your minecart and prevent your gold to fall. You can use it on signboard and other metallic surfaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Control:<br/></strong>- <strong>Left click</strong> to launch hook on signpost and <strong>hold </strong>to stay hooked and slow your cart. If you stay hooked and\u00a0are too far from the signpost, the rope will break and you will have to wait for a few seconds to fire it, so you need to <strong>release </strong>soon enough! Rope is going from <strong>green</strong> to <strong>red </strong>to feedback the rope length.<br/></p>\n<p>- <strong>Escape</strong> to restart</p>\n<p>- <strong>Alt+F4 </strong>to quit the game (sorry about that &gt;&lt;)</p>\n<p><strong>Known issues:<br/></strong>- Broken gold system\u00a0making the game harder than intended and score not consistent<br/>- End game <em>(when the camera stops following the cart)</em>\u00a0: Leaderboard and score\u00a0<em>(time and gold related)</em> are not displayed<br/>- Sound glitch at the beginning if going too slow<br/>- Some signs are missing, some are misplaced<br/>- Fullscreen on some hardware can make the game slower, try launching it in windowed</p>\n<p>We are hard at work to improve the game and to make it better, we'll submit new versions after the jam !</p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong><strong>Art:</strong>\u00a0GLUu, marcel.lenoir, Marine_Anglade<br/><strong>Design: </strong>Aegard<br/><strong>Programming:</strong>\u00a0Arkmenrah, MaxiPoki<br/><strong>Sound:</strong>\u00a0NicolasDiteriks</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bc3/bc3336a4de8538f532291bf148946f78.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 325, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MaxiPoki", "Arkmenrah", "GLUu", "marcel.lenoir", "NicolasDiteriks", "Marine_Anglade", "Aegard"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
