We collaborated on the overall design and ideation of the game. My focus was on the art aspects of the game while Callum focused on the programming.<br/></p>\n<p>We aimed to create a fun endless runner using procedural generation of the level to keep the game interesting and increase the difficulty over time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We collaborated on the level design from a functional and story telling perspective. The levels were split into pre-designed segments that had models placed to convey the story of the game world. From the functional side of things we did this so that the game could be an endless runner with obstacles procedurally spawning into the world allowing for fresh challenges each play through.</p>\n<p>On the art side of things we were drawn to the low poly art style as it is something we both love and think it hold great potential for games. We decided to use an asset pack that matched the style we were going for and allowed us to achieve the snow theme we were doing.\u00a0An added benefit of the low poly art style was it allowed the game to have better performance on mobile platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T08:21:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8ca3fb3ffe62c0316ddd17a9a51691ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Vehlow012"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
