It's an endless runner set in the human body as you the player takes on the roll of heartburn (represented as a flame girl), shooting down and avoiding all necessary threats that are in your way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This my is my first 2D game I've made with a limited amount of resources on the free version of Construct 2 where it was developed while all artwork and animations were done on Photoshop. I hope you enjoy the game!!</p>\n<p>P.S. Yes, your little flame sidekick is most definitely a Gurren Lagann reference. Can't you tell by those rocking shades???\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/937/937135052af097df234271adf2e2d0f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mikey_Lawless"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
