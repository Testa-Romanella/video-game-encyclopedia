{"id": 6773, "slug": "sunset-overdrive", "name": "Sunset Overdrive", "name_original": "Sunset Overdrive", "description": "<p>2027, the metropolis of Sun City.</p>\n<p>The city is full of creatures, savage, aggressive and insane - these creatures were just ordinary townspeople a short while ago, but they abused the energy drink produced by Fizzco, in which something was wrong with the recipe. In general, loyal consumers mutated into monsters and now nothing can be done with them, only to kill everyone.</p>\n<p>The protagonist (by the way, who worked at Fizzco) is not constrained by any laws of physics, can move around the city in any direction, run on walls and wires, jump like a kangaroo and so on. This is not parkour, it&#39;s just complete freedom of movement. He also has a &quot;guidance system&quot; that shows him the way.</p>\n<p>In addition to the hero, several groups and singles of varying degrees of eccentricity are fighting monsters in the city. Monsters also do not belong to the same type. Monsters are many, they are very different and extremely unusual - there are, for example, creatures fused with water cannons or a bucket from an excavator. The hero&#39;s weapon is even more diverse than the monsters. Various weapons rush vinyl records, throw bowling balls, shoot teddy bears with pieces of TNT in their paws and this is not the whole list.</p>\n<p>The game has about fifty amps to move the hero and defeat the monsters.</p>", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2014-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-07T03:12:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c2e/c2eb6021a2596644b437e943612af25c.jpg", "website": "https://insomniac.games/game/sunset-overdrive/", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 186, "owned": 3234, "beaten": 391, "toplay": 129, "dropped": 272, "playing": 40}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 271, "ratings_count": 701, "suggestions_count": 372, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 707, "platforms": ["PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["Insomniac Games", "Blind Squirrel Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "THQ Nordic"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
