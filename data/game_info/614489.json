In the dark, the walls become mist (use your imagination, please :-D) and you can go anywhere. But the walls become real again when the light strikes them.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to extinguish the torches of all the intruders. You will lose the game if you are exposed to the light for too long. Be quick, and don't get out-maneuvered by the AI! Click to move.
