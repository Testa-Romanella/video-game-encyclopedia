It causes the flies to lose their colorful glow!</p>\n<p>You play as a small, busy bee shooting your magical pollen at the fireflies to cure them.</p>\n\n<p>This causes a lot of commotion in the forest, and attracts the attention of the other, unsuspecting forest dwellers, who will angrily attack you.</p>\n<p>Among them, to make matters worse, are your own brothers and sisters - and even your mother: Her majesty the Queen bee!</p>\n\n<p>So while you try to help, you become your own enemy.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can also calm the attackers with your pollen so that they retreat back into the forest.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The games mechanic and goal is fairly simple - yet it is hard to master.</p>\n<p>First and foremost you should try to cure as many fireflies as you can with your pollen. Cured fireflies (and only them) are raising your highscore.</p>\n<p>At the same time you have to calm the angry attackers and dodge their projectiles. So you will constantly have to decide what to give priority.</p>\n<p>To make your journey a little easier, cured fireflies randomly drop extra lifes. Collecting them let you survive a little longer.</p>\r\nOur Team\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Game soundtrack \"Jazzy Frenchy\" by bensound.com</p>\n<p>SoundFx from freesound.org and\u00a0 mixkit.co - edited with ocenaudio</p>\n<p>All gameart assets hand-drawn with \u2764 and edited with Krita by Humane Tiger</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-25T07:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fce48e7efb14146be369f3495e68fd2e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WillemH"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
