It's a round based, procedurally generated hybrid, combining its core shooter elements with score multipliers and colour puzzle mechanics.</p>\n<p>As you progress you unlock new ships with drastically different abilities, including the capacity to snipe, manipulate time, control enemy positions, become invincible or simply fling a beam of destruction across the screen.</p>\n<p>Advance through the games different modes that each put a very different spin on the core mechanics, and as you improve graduate to new and terrifying levels of difficulty.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you're kind enough to add a couple more dollars to your purchase, you will get a retrospective of\u00a0the development of <em>in Space</em>. This includes a written retrospective along with videos and twelve playable builds of the game going from the very first day of development all the way to being pretty-much-done.
