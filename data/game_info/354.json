Battle alongside our two heroes: The samurai Kaoru Tamanegi and the street fighter Broccoli Joe all across the Feudal Japan in their new adventure!<br/><br/>You can switch between characters at any point but bear in mind that, even if you are a lone wolf, you'll still need to combine both heroes in order to overcome all the enemies and puzzles that Kyurinaga is going to throw at you.
