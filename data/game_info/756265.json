The terrain is pre-generated with perlin noise on MagicaVoxel. The trees / grasses and all other elements are placed in real time by raycasting in an area around our hero. It has dynamic day and night cycle and many more details like wind changing direction and speed, a humidity system that affects the fog. Almost everything in the world is interactable/pickable/kickable since I hate static things on games. The combat is pretty \"meh\" and doesn't feel good. Also everything is climbable ( inspired by breath of the wild\u00a0) and you can go in every\u00a0 direction from the start of the game, which made me realize how hard it makes designing an experience for the player.</p>\n\n<p>That prototype was a great learning experience, I just decided to put it here because as I\u00a0revisited it, I\u00a0found out that it can still offer a feeling on the player just walking around and exploring. Just don't expect many stuff in it ^^ Also it can be a good experience for developers to find some inspiration!</p>\n\n<p>Everything in the project was made by me, except the music that I\u00a0found inspiring while making it and used it as a placeholder, decided to leave it in there since this project is just for educational purposes and the music of\u00a0takashi kokubo is so beautiful.\u00a0 &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T10:56:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0ffe2f345c8dccb638b9a8ab519ee42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 150, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rico"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
