The Game as you know must have been made in 48 hours. So It's not perfect. But the main idea is that this little boy is actually a grown up man who has his own house,own family now. By chance he found out a box full of old stuff, and old pictures of him. It made him remember his childhood and his teenagehood , his first love ( who became his wife ! yeah happy story ) and his old house. How to play: Level 1 : \" Tidy home\" The title speaks for itself. You need to tidy the house . And you're a little child. Children tend to put their hands in their mouth , so after cleaning ( only after cleaning) , what should you do? Level 2 : \" Where I met her\" . Yes he's supposed to be a teenager but you know, lack of time and stuff .. so .. you're stuck with the little boy for now. :D So what's the level about? He's at school, and he has a crush. Cute right? He wanna give her something, so he has to put it in her locker.. Which one is hers? Find out. ( Look for clues in everything) Level 3: \" Scared of the dark\" . You're in your bedroom but it's so dark there.. so turn on the lights. :) (Clues? There are 3 light sources in there. Find them and turn them on ). That's it ! have fun ! C&amp;C are welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T07:41:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d05/d05c4ef277d12a8155d22724d4f76d7d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
