Well now you can! You, Steve Starwell, can use shooting stars to defeat the encroaching mold, sent in by the meteor men to destroy Earth. Use your innovative, puzzle-solving brain to run, jump, and blast your way further into the meteor-king's heart! But beware, they know you're coming, so they've intentionally booby-trapped the entrances and made them hard to reach. Fortunately for you, Steve Starwell, they also need to get in, so each door is technically possible to reach. Stay strong, cool, and level headed, and you can make it to the end! Remember, only shooting stars break the mold.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T06:06:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f3cf98347865c88ecfa7b4c89024eb3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Monkey Barrel"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
