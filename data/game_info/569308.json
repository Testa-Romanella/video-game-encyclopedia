After using a Bash to get forward momentum, you can let go of all directional inputs to the side. This way you will keep all the Bash momentum as long as you don't hit a wall or touch the ground for too long. But don't worry, if this sounds too difficult, you can get through the game without ever doing this.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-24T03:11:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c7a261104aad9b66b01c37752531c30.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Komori", "Hannes Legner"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Hannes Legner"], "esrb_rating": null}
