{"id": 657, "slug": "happy-wars", "name": "Happy Wars", "name_original": "Happy Wars", "description": "<p>Happy Wars is an online multiplayer role-playing strategy; it also features a campaign mode. The game consists of matches: two 15-layers teams try to destroy the opponent\u2019s castle and protect their own.</p>\n<p>In Happy Wars you can choose between three types of characters: the warrior, the mage, and the cleric. They also have subclasses that define their specification. For example, Berserker is stronger than an ordinary warrior and more suitable for protecting lines. In general, every class has their unique abilities that can be upgraded with the in-game currency and real money. Wisely balanced teams have more chances to win battles.</p>\n<p>The key feature that differs Happy Wars from other MOBA-type games is that before you destroy your opponent\u2019s base you need to build yours. Bases are equipped with multiple weapons so it\u2019s hard to get close to the enemy rift. Besides the center, there are several control points; the most massive battles are usually held near them. However, the cartoonish style of the visuals makes such epic fights look funny, explaining the name of the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-10-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-02T00:16:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/45c/45cf373b371c1912613ff799a16e4fa2.jpg", "website": "http://www.happywars.net", "rating": 2.58, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 39, "owned": 1567, "beaten": 27, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 126, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 132, "ratings_count": 183, "suggestions_count": 583, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 184, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Toylogic"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Toylogic"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
