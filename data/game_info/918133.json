There is no tutorial so if you for some reason want to play this you should read this first. There's no actual microtransactions so you can just get infinite money by clicking the money buttons. The game is a simple fighting game where you attack with the left mouse button and dodge with the right mouse button. Use space to use healing potions (If you have any). Press escape to leave while in a battle.\u00a0Press F to fullscreen and S to unfullscreen. That is everything you need to know except that the game sucks and will never get updated. (Please don't) Enjoy :)\u00a0 ( :(. ).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T07:48:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2f4/2f4f6acb34ec7239e92d001e5fe59bf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Unknown_ 3200"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
