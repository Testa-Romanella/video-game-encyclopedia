A race to the finish, meal after meal!</em></p><p>This is a small project I made a few weeks ago, for Ludum Dare 34. The theme, out of the two for the competition, I chose was \"Two Button\". I wasn't able to finish for the deadline, but I wanted to put this out in some form. Definitely expect a small update or two in the future as well.<br/></p><p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong><strong>Submit</strong><strong>:</strong> Space Bar</p><p>Player 1<br/><strong>Left Hand: </strong>A key<br/><strong>Right Hand:</strong> D key</p><p>Player 2<br/><strong>Left Hand: </strong>J key<br/><strong>Right Hand:</strong> L key</p><p>INSTRUCTIONS<br/>Your goal is, using your left and right hand, to eat your list of food as quickly as possible, before the other player finishes theirs. To do this, you alternate between pressing the Left Hand button and the Right Hand button, filling up your Fullness meter. Alternate too quickly, you'll raise your Bloatness meter, shown as the clock symbol at the top. Alternate too slow and you won't feel full in the slightest!</p><p>Changing the difficulty changes how much food is on each player's list. </p><p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong><strong>Game Design, Code, Art:</strong> Bryce Williams<br/><strong>Art:</strong> Gunnar McBeth</p><p>Music Credits<br/><strong>Title Screen: </strong>\"Arpanauts\" by Eric Skiff<br/><strong>Gameplay: </strong>\"RottenMage SpaceJacked OST 09\" by sawsquarenoise<br/><strong>Results Screen: </strong>\"CopperNickle\" by UncleBibby</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e1/9e1b8de782b7639efefd7d2a4ec7dfad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["DynamicDonut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
