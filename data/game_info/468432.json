Art<br/>I decided to change the controls to EDSF and Arrow Key based for Accesibility. Apparently people in France don't have WASD. Also most cheap keyboards and older keyboards can't register more than 3 or so keys at a time, with the exception of some special ones like shift and alt. <br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Artist and Game Programmer: Safir</p>\n<p>Game Consultant and Play Tester: TheBoog</p>\n<p>Musician and SFX Designer: LiterallyHades</p>\n<p>Software used: Godot Game Engine, Aseprite, BFXR, Reaper, Kilohearts Snap Heap<br/></p>\n<p>The Explosion assets were made by <strong>Will Tice </strong>of <strong>unTiedGames</strong>.
