Gather resources, kill monsters, acquire new technologies and use your imagination to build crazy mechanical devices to conquer any challenges in your way.<br/><br/>You are stranded on a strange and forbidding planet, where survival is made difficult by hostile animals and plant life. From your home world you did bring a multitool, which is able to craft any kind of machine part - provided the requisite raw materials can be found. Relying solely on the technology you brought, you set out to explore a whole world. You can progress through the game by acquiring new types of steam-powered technology elements, that are necessary to delve deeper into the diverse biomes of the planet, and perhaps, ultimately, discover the means to escape. <br/><br/>You can construct any kind of machine of your own design - and any kind of machine can be simulated by the game's physics engine - and of course, designs can be shared with your friends.<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Explore randomly generated open worlds with both sandbox and story driven mode/play.<br/></li><li>Gather a variety of useful resources.<br/></li><li>Construct your own unique mechanical steam-powered machines and devices with only your imagination as the limit.<br/></li><li>Test your mechanical constructions versus monsters and bosses, will you survive?<br/></li><li>Create blueprints of your mechanical constructions, use them later or share them with friends and prove who\u2019s the mechanical mastermind.<br/></li><li>Acquire new technologies with the experience / level-based progression system.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Multiplayer and Co-op!<br/></li><li>More acts!<br/></li><li>More technologies!<br/></li><li>More monsters!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-25T18:23:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2e/d2e3b918bb4d425eea82cbd631c20eb6.jpg", "website": "http://www.mechanicminer.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 5, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 166, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stillplay"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["stillplay"], "esrb_rating": null}
