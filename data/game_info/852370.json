But as it develops, it turns out that the land is not so classic again, and the decisions made by the player can lead the hero into unexpected areas. In my opinion, the strengths of the game are the high non-linearity, the number of endings and the real influence of the player on the course of the scenario. <br/></p>\n<p>If You liked this game, You can find other my creations on site: https://adeptusrpg.wordpress.com/ \r\n    </p>\n<p>Also, You can \"like\" my game on the Facebook fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/Adeptus-101489662679412\r\n<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-16T20:02:34", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Adeptus7"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
