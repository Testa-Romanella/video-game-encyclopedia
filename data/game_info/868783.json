I was very entertained with the creation process around that subject. Some of the inspiration came from the games like <strong>20 Minutes Till Dawn</strong>.</p>\n<p>First sketch of the game was about a duel between two cultists. They would turn the sheep and then kill them to gain power and health. The more sheep killed at once, the bigger the multiplier for the gain would be. With enough power gained a cultist would become a demon with extremely high powers. In short: you kill the other, you win.<br/><br/>It turned out to be quite hard as it never occurred to me that, well, AI is very hard to implement. Especially if you want it bugless and well done (not very wise for a game jam, I know) and I did not want nor I had any experience in multiplayer systems.</p>\n<p>In the end I decided to create a shoot' em up (I lack terminology, apologies if that is a wrong genre) with elements of kind-of resource management.</p>\n\n<p>And yeah, I am aware that the trial has funny connotations but don't worry, it's not like Netflix - the trial never ends.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T10:43:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f06/f06fa888fc170a0228952eadb5310fa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dalajnikon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
