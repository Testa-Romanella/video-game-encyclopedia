Support will be included in a future update.<br/><br/>Nature Treks: Together is a place just for you or a place to connect with others using a combination of shape, color, and sound. Intuitively transition deeper to rediscover the benefits of expression, the value of emotion, and escape into a powerful sensory experience.<h3>A multiplayer or single player experience</h3>Immerse yourself into a world of peace, calm, and relaxation. Explore beautiful and detailed environments, alive with the relaxing sounds of nature. Re-energize yourself on untouched beaches or seamlessly dive into the cool clear waters. Join up to 16 people or relax and explore on your own.<br/><h3>Painting instruments</h3>Activating \"thought mode\" will give you access to a 'paint palette'. Using your index finger you are free to draw anything you imagine. Each line you draw also becomes a unique instrument based on the line color, width, and length of each stroke.<br/><h3>The creator and emotion halos</h3>Summon the creator halo to create and shape your environment. Throw the creator orbs to grow trees, bushes, flowers, and rocks. Alternatively switch to the emotion halo and express yourself using the emotion orbs. Envelop yourself and others in warm auras of joyful color, manifest your own personal rain cloud, or create awe-inspiring galaxies.<br/><h3>Fire side chat</h3>Nature Treks: Together is a place where users can rediscover the fundamentals of communication. Proximity-based voice chat is enabled around campfires. Gather and add wood to the fire, the bigger the fire the greater the distance voice chat is active.<br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T03:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06e1dd4b2b05a234db7c9d17ba8d48f3.jpg", "website": "https://greenergames.net/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 451, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["John Carline", "Greener Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Greener Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
