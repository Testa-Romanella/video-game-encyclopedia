The gameplay features color theory based puzzle and combat mechanics and gravity manipulation based puzzle and platforming mechanics. There are a lot of simple systems stacked on top of each other which makes it easy to learn, but difficult to master.\r\n</p>Features<ul>\n<li>Colorblind mode for those of us that see the world differently.</li>\n<li>Shooter mechanics that are based around color theory. Shoot infected pixel with their opposite colors to turn them white and make them a dead pixel.</li>\n<li>Platforming mechanics based around manipulating the gravity of yourself and other objects.</li>\n<li>Puzzle mechanics that involve gravity manipulation and color theory. Change the color and gravity of yourself and other objects to get through the levels.</li>\n<li>Full story told throughout a series of challenging puzzles.</li>\n<li>A drag and drop level editor with a logic engine that allows you to make simple or complex levels.</li>\n<li>Stereoscopic 3D mode for devices like the Oculus Rift.</li>\n</ul>Future Additions<p>\r\n\tDo not buy this game based on this list.\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>A central hub for the community to share levels with each other that can be accessed both inside and outside of the game.</li>\n<li>A secure online leaderboard for all levels within the game -- including those created by the community.</li>\n<li>A cooperative mode for playing with your friends offline and online.</li>\n<li>Team based online player-vs-player.</li>\n</ul>PC Master Race<p>120 Hz</p><p>\r\n\tPixel: ru\u00b2 is designed to be run at 120 FPS. If needed, it can be rendered at a lower framerate through the video settings, but it will still internally run at a smooth 120 Hz.</p><p>4K Display</p><p>Pixel: ru\u00b2 may look like a low resolution game, but it's actually designed for a 4K display. Anything smaller results in the graphics being scaled down to fit correctly. This means that instead of the graphics being stretched or duplicated for scaling up, they are blended together smoothly for scale down. This results in a much nicer looking experience for all resolutions.<br/></p><p>RGB Keyboard</p><p>\r\n\tHave a keyboard with RGB LED's in it? We designed Pixel: ru\u00b2 to take advantage of them by doing colorful effects while you play the game resulting in a more immersive experience</p><p>\r\n\tHere's a list of keyboards we currently support:\r\n</p><ul>\n<li>Corsair Gaming K65 RGB Mechanical Gaming</li>\n<li>Corsair Gaming K70 RGB Mechanical Gaming</li>\n<li>Corsair Gaming K95 RGB Mechanical Gaming</li>\n</ul><p>\r\n\tMore will be coming in the next few months.\r\n</p><p>Virtual Reality</p><p>\r\n\tEven though Pixel: ru\u00b2 is a 2D game it still has a stereoscopic mode that allows it to be played with devices such as the Oculus Rift. This feature is still in development and needs additional work.</p><p>\r\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development.
