{"id": 111615, "slug": "seltani", "name": "Seltani", "name_original": "Seltani", "description": "<p>\r\n\tLaunch Seltani in its own window\r\n</p><p>\n<em>Seltani</em> is an online, shared, text-based, open-source fan project based on the Myst series of games. In this environment, players can create and share explorable worlds.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can think of \r\n\t<em>Seltani</em> as a modern take on MUDs (and MUSHes, etc). Instead of an old-style command prompt, you explore by clicking links in a hypertext world. (You still have MUD-style text chat, of course.) You build new worlds using a wiki-like markup system.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can also think of \r\n\t<em>Seltani</em> as a massively multiplayer Twine game (although it uses a different engine based on Python). Or you could think of it as an all-text <em>Myst Online</em>.\r\n</p><p>\n<strong>Seltani is not associated with or supervised by Cyan Worlds.</strong> This is a fan project. I created it back in 2013 as an experiment. I don't accept money for <em>Seltani</em>. (Although if you want to support further development of the open-source engine that powers it, please contact me!)<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tA quick tutorial:\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYou can register a (free) account or explore as a guest. Guests can explore, collect linking pages, and chat, but you must register in order to build.</p><p>\r\n\tIn the Information Booth, start by taking a booklet. (Click the link.) You can then step into the changing room to set your (text) avatar description and pronouns.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tYour location is always described in the top pane. Close-up descriptions appear in a pop-up center pane. The bottom pane is a timeline of events and chat messages.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe right-hand column is your linking booklet. When you find a linking book, you can copy the link into a page of your booklet. In this way, your collection of worlds will grow. Some worlds are shared; some are private; some can be explored either way.\r\n</p><p>Start by exploring the Seltani District, which acts as a starting hub. You will find links to more worlds and collections of worlds. Some are puzzles, some are just for exploration.</p><p>\r\n\tTo build new worlds, find the Ascheta link in the District. (Or, for a shortcut, click your name in the header and then select \"build permission\".)\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\r\n\tA map of the Seltani \"hub\" district\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d6/1d6f580c44ca925341794d142a543d16.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["zarf"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
