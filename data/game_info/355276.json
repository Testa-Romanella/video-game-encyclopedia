The dragon will always run, all you have to do is press the up button or the down button at the right moment.<br/><br/>Try to catch all the apples to get three stars at the end of the level. These stars will be useful for the progression of the game. Your health points affect the number of stars.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:42:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c1/8c1e3d81e359b16d73e92ccbc3cb505d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS"], "developers": ["Christopher Legare Roussel"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Christopher Legare Roussel"], "esrb_rating": null}
