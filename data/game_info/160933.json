This project was started as an assignment for my course \"3D4Games\" at Digital Arts and Entertainment. The current version is a working prototype of the core\u00a0mechanics, using placeholder art. The level itself is also fairly quickly put-together, and ramps up in difficulty quite quickly. Furthermore I'd like to experiment with different styles of cameras, as I'm not satisfied with the current Top-Down gameplay.</p>\n<p>The goal for this project, is to expand upon the current version [essentially a prototype], add more ways to manipulate time [already implemented but currently unused], and create a fun, but challenging gameplay experience in the vein of Portal.</p>\n<p>Any and all feedback\u00a0would be greatly appreciated!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/819/819b96d110ac4584b3785e7f54ac4c4f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 120, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glenn van Waesberghe"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
