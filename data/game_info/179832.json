Whenever you hit the board with your darts, you get runes that are used at the end of your three throws in order to select which spell you'll cast. Most spells deal damage to your enemies, some will heal you or give you boosts. Others are to be discovered!</p><p>There are 50 enemies to defeat, each with their strengths - and sometimes weaknesses. Whenever you defeat an enemy, you level up, gaining new runes, more health or more spell power. If you die, you start over from the beginning, with new enemy encounters, rune placements and opportunities for success.</p><p>Magic Darts is very simple to play since all you do is press Enter and watch darts go! How many enemies can you defeat?</p><p>This game was created for the NES Box Art Jam and my inspiration is Magic Darts - a game that, now that I look at it, is only basic darts. No magic there!</p><p><strong>v2</strong><br/></p><ul><li>Fixed ending-related bug</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c59/c59196284897ec81b00f93a4af87b06f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["poik007"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
