With this ball you get powerups, ammo, time, defense or control. If you lose every ball, you lose. But if you destroy the enough objects in the screen, or the wall, you can get a new ball, but for each ball you get, it will be more difficult, like the wall. Check if you can survive and destroy every wall to reach your objective, that is... destroy every wall.</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>[Joystick(XBOX360)]</p>\n<p>Pause: Start</p>\n<p>Player movement: Left Stick</p>\n<p>Fast movement: X</p>\n<p>Slow movement: A</p>\n<p>Shot Laser: Right Trigger</p>\n<p>Slow time: Left Trigger</p>\n<p>Hold ball: R Button</p>\n<p>Activate Barrier: L Button</p>\n\n<p>[Keyboard]</p>\n<p>Pause: Intro</p>\n<p>Player movement: wasd / Arrows</p>\n<p>Fast movement: K / Z</p>\n<p>Slow movement: L / X</p>\n<p>Shot Laser: Space</p>\n<p>Slow time: N / Ctrl</p>\n<p>Hold ball: J / Left Shift</p>\n<p>Activate Barrier: E / C</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-21T06:23:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/33b/33bbe67d3a80d635970e67f160fc525c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaviDice"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
