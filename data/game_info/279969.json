If they crash, its game over. So you have to be quick with your fingers to move this road block so that the race continues, no one crashes, and you can rack up some points! The racers depend on you, the people of the entire galaxy are watching, do you have what it takes to have the longest race without any crashes? <br/><br/>Space Road Block is a simple yet very challenging game that has a very retro, atari feel to it.
