Inspired by the theme 'fight or flight' we thought it was funny to have a flightless bird as our protagonist who had no choice in the matter he could only choose to fight.\u00a0\u00a0We were plagued with technical issues and really didn't get much in in the way of features. What we ended up with\u00a0is more of a funky chicken walking simulator.</p>\n<p>I really like the art Dave did for this, he also whipped up the\u00a0 funky beat with his kaossilator.</p>\n<p>This is my second HTML5 game and my first\u00a0using the CreateJS Framework. There is some fun beat detection going on that I'm pleased with. The window lights\u00a0 and\u00a0the moon and stars all react to\u00a0 the beat of the music as do the dance moves in the idle cycle. Sadly the cat villains never got coded and they just die in place on start up. If you turn around and walk to the left at any point you'll soon find the hole in the world and one cat who's still twitching. We never got to the actual fighting part at all but I think I'll likely try to at least make it playable.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3a9/3a930823955bf4260ed380d06b94c4d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Stevebro"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
