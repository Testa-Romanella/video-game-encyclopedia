Using the resources and land available, each giving different perks, land control is the utmost priority.</p>\n<p>Balance your needs to defend your land with your ability to expand beyond your borders by managing your resources and maintaining your strength upon the board!</p>\n<p>Conquer Chaos is quick to play, with games taking between 2 - 10 minutes. An effective time killer for those who are bored.</p>\n<p>This is my first graphics-based game, and feedback would be greatly, greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 1.1: Balancer</strong></p>\n<p>- New Difficulty: Dominion</p>\n<p>- Existing Difficulties now much, much harder to balance the game</p>\n<p>- You can now use SPACE as the Next Turn hotkey!</p>\n<p>- Redone GUI. Everything is easier to read now, from game to How to Play Menu!</p>\n<p>- Attacking is much more balanced: attackers lose some strength when attacking tiles: Tactical retreats are much more viable now.</p>\n<p>- Pressing 'F' now brings up FPS, difficulty, and how long you've been playing.</p>\n<p>- Fish give 3 additional water tiles from 2.</p>\n<p>and finally, several bug fixes that make the game an overall better experience!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c77/c77262f7f2a868fa6f8127e3a2a40bb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 85, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Leogic"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
