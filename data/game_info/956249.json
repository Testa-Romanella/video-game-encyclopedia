The gameplay aims to mix brawling and platforming with a pixel-art look and feel. Several play modes are available :\u00a0<em>Regular</em>\u00a0(hit points and healing spots),\u00a0<em>Insta-kill</em>\u00a0(one hit, one kill), and\u00a0<em>Bump</em>\u00a0(where attacks are replaced by bumping opponents' head). Victory conditions can be set at the beginning of a session, involving a maximum number of point to be reached, and/or a session duration.<br/><br/>Players can select one of the available characters. The same character can't be selected more than once.<br/><br/>In each game mode, players have access to their character's superpower. To activate it, the player must to double tap the \"Down/Special\" control. It will unleash the super power. Each character has their own super power. Some are very powerful, some are just annoying and finally, some may seems useless but it depends a lot on of the arena. Superpowers have recharge time (in order to avoid spamming) and duration.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T12:06:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b94/b94ac0e409f2fc17ea6a0e9b208012a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 425, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Casual Garage Coder"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
