So I opened <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> for the first time and created this small prototype in <strong>two weeks.</strong></p>\r\nWhy Klonoa:\r\n<p>I always loved <strong>Klonoa </strong>with his <strong>Sonic</strong>-like design (it's like <strong>Tails </strong>cool brother) but with such a <strong>dynamic design</strong>, I thought his games was kind of <strong>slow and rigid</strong>. So I was thinking about a <strong>faster gameplay</strong> and it ended up like a mix of <strong>Klonoa </strong>and <strong>Quake </strong>(almost called the game <strong>Qulonoake</strong>).<br/></p>\r\nWhat's next:\r\n<p>I know I'll disapoint a lot of people, but I'm <strong>not planning on contuining</strong>. I had an idea in mind and I just wanted\u00a0 to see how it would play. But maybe  <strong>Bandai Namco</strong> will see this, think it's good and send me a <strong>cease and desist letter</strong> before <strong>making their own Klonoa game</strong>...<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li><strong>Move</strong>: WASD (ZQSD also work)</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Spacebar</li><li><strong>Double jump</strong>: Spacebar while grabbing an enemy</li><li><strong>Shoot</strong>: Left mouse click</li><li><strong>Aim</strong>: Right mouse click</li><li><strong>Go to last checkpoint</strong>: R</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Made by Antoine \"Taldius\" Semblat</li><li>Character models come from The Models Resource</li><li>Environment elements come from Kenney asset bundles</li><li>Special thanks to <strong>Genroa </strong>for the UE4 expertise and code refactoring</li><li>And a big thank you to the<strong> Klonoa fans</strong>.
