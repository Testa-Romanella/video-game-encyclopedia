I was given a random item and told to create a story and history for it. i received a fluffy cotton ball and came up with the idea of light battling dark and began to plan out my game narrative and character design. in the beginning  i was unsure about my character's design. it started off human and female and by the end of the design journey it became a glowing genderless dog. i had a lot of fun with this game using different religions and mythologies to create the game world. the names are a mix of hebrew and hindu the art style is a mix of american and japanese, the villains are a combination of them all.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>Keyboard:</p><p>Movement:WASD </p><p>                                                                                                Jump:Y </p><p>                                                                                                            Light projectile:T </p><p>                                                                                              Heavy projectile:R</p><p>PS4:</p><p>Movement:Analog </p><p>                                                                                         Jump:X </p><p>                                                                                                            Light Projectile:R1 </p><p>                                                                                          Heavy Projectile:Square</p><p>Updates:</p><p>Art Assets replaced, Screen shake added, Damage effect added, boss fight added, Screen wrap added.
