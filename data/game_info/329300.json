There are a few bugs in the current build that I\u00a0wish to iron out in the near future and an additional gameplay system (or two) that I\u00a0might implement in the future. It's still somewhat of a work in progress, but\u00a0I\u00a0hope people can enjoy what's here right now!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T05:14:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6c/f6c211b00a8726800b7965eecf0e350b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["oneal-dev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
