The game is free for you to play so no reason not to join the race! <br/></p><p>Glitch is not an ordinary racing game. What makes Glitch racing so different from other racing games?</p><p>1 vs 1 competitive racing and music discovery is the answer to that question. In Glitch racing you can play online versus other racers in a competitive, invasion based racing world. <br/></p><p>The purpose is winning, of course. That's why you can also practice by yourself to prepare for a race!</p><p>Win by collecting boosts and trying to bump each other off the track.</p><p>As you race, you'll be listening to brand new music made by artists that deserve to be discovered. Bookmark the soundtracks that you really like and then buy them for yourself to listen to whenever you want!</p><p>And the best bit is that Glitch is completely <strong>FREE</strong>.</p><p>Win or lose, it's your choice.. Kick ass.
