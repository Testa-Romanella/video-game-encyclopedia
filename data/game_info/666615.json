Sketching real buildings she'd seen on her own travels. The game was initially inspired by the Swiss mountains, where the houses are made from\u00a0dark brown wood, decorated with bright red flowers outside the windows. So cartoonish and too beautiful not to draw, this became a huge inspiration.\u00a0Considering the Swiss flag looks like five pixels arranged together, creating pixel art happened naturally. It's a tribute to a truly beautiful country, which still has an authentic feel and a culture that seems so delicate that one wonders if it will still remain, and thus must be recorded and preserved. From that, the game has developed beyond the high mountains, and into fantastical lands, where dreams and reality become blurred. For are they not but one and\u00a0the same?\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T03:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/977/977ceb42e2dd0fdcedc533e39245f1cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["antonianimations"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
