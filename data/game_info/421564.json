For each memory the player collects, we present them a part of this musician's past and after the player restored all of his memories, they get to see the whole story complete. Depending on how the player does, a special memory might be shown at the end of the game that could change the perception of what actually happened in this musician's life.</p><p>Short trailer for the game:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Link to the GGJ page of the game: https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/kioku-2</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-23T04:20:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/86998b0ecf0aa6ee30d7c7ddbff50bc1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CSDiabo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
