Any bit of information coming into the brain (aside from smell &amp; vision) comes in through the brainstem, and it is only through the brainstem that the brain can influence how we act or what we say.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This app will focus on the groupings of nuclei that serve the cranial nerves and we hope we can simplify the structures on which you rely on so much.<br/></p><p>The Build a Brainstem app was created as part of a research project for the MSc in Medical Visualisation &amp; Human Anatomy of the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) &amp; the University of Glasgow (UofG). The app was built by Sinaoife Andrews, MSc student of GSA &amp; UofG, with supervision &amp; contributions by Dr. Matthieu Poyade of GSA &amp; Professor John Paul Leach of UofG.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-09T08:04:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40f/40f7a8b5b6be7c744878f685290e75c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["sinaoife"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
