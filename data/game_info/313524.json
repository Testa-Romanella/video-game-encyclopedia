It's mostly narrative-focused, which means that exploring and clicking around the environment is encouraged, as it provides more details of the story (no pixel hunting though, promised!). Because the total play time is only around 15 minutes, there's no save function.</p>\n<p>Move the cursor to the top of the screen to access your inventory, click on an item to select it and right-click to deselect it.
