A game based on casual theme, this game provides you a tough challanging environment where you have to collect all the coins in the level without hitting any of the enemy.<br/>You start off as a ball in a Lego Maze, with a ton of enemies moving around. Your only aim is to collect all the coins in the level. Though this is a casual game, it is not meant to be played casually.
