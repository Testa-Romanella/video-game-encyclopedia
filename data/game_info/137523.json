The theme of the jam was \"Everybody is dead\".</p><p>I chose to read the theme literally and starts off the game with humankind being destroyed by nuclear war. All this is seen from the Grim Reaper's window, and throughout the game you will control him in an effort to collect all the souls. </p><p>The game is really short, but it does tell the story I wanted to tell. Though the game could easily be extended upon with more levels.</p><p>-------------------------------------------<br/>CREDITS<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/>Everything in this game was made by me, Simon a.k.a.
