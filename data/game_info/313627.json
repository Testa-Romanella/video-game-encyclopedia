{"id": 313627, "slug": "the-list-nikki-bee", "name": "The List (Nikki Bee)", "name_original": "The List (Nikki Bee)", "description": "<p>The List is a light-hearted adventure game with simple platforming, a few minigames, and a focus on dialogue. It should take 2-3 hours to finish. Due to the length, and amount of reading, I recommend playing it over multiple sessions.</p>\n<p>Should you need help progressing in the game, or if want to make sure you find every item, there is an extensive walkthrough included.</p>\r\nLinux Compatibility\r\n<p>You can play The List on Linux using WINE! The game has been completely playtested using WINE on Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>If you are using 64-bit Linux, and the game starts without any sound, you might be missing 32-bit libraries for your default sound device. As a common example, if your setup is PulseAudio on 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu, you can install 32-bit libraries using the apt-get utility:\r\napt-get install libpulse0:i386</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>The List is a game by Nikki Bee. You can find more by me on my website.</p>\n<p>The entire soundtrack was done by Christopher Psukhe. It's included with the game in medium quality Ogg Vorbis format, as well as the original MIDI format. It's also available in other formats on his Bandcamp!</p>\n<p>Further credits are available in \"Credits.txt\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T06:35:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cae/caee778421e6e5a0774e7410243738e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 181, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Nikki Bee"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
