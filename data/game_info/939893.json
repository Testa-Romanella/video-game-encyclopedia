It also had to feature an opening cutscene, an animated door and a third-person controller.<br/><br/>For the continuation, I also had to add detonation/impact, which I did with a shooting powerup that will allow the 2D character to shoot and destroy certain blocks.<br/><br/>Controls are displayed in the bottom left corner in game.<br/>PS: Heavily inspired by Super Mario Odyssey for visuals, gameplay and sounds.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T04:51:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5f8/5f85816106a992a2c2fe2b20b84a6f9c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MikeNoLife"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
