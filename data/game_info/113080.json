Build upon real scientific data, Termitia brings you in the depths of an underground termite nest.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe player takes control of an intervention brigade agent sent to rescue the scientific team in charge of monitoring the termite nest. Only reflexes, a good sense of orientation and the ability to quikly grasp how the termites nest and it's occupants function can allow the player to succesfully carry out his\u00b7her mission.<br/>\n</p><p>\n<em>A</em><em>s Termitia is a non profit pedagogical project, <strong>you can download it for free</strong>. But the project' team has many ideas to improve the game, so will you! So, <strong>don't hesitate to donate </strong>any amount you wish and we will use that money to add cool new features or to launch a crowdfunding campaing to developp a whole new artificial collective intelligence for our termites. </em></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>We are a cultural, \r\n\tscience-based non profit organisation. The idea of this game came out of the discussions we had with the Animal Cognition Research Center' team. They gave us their trust, and generously shared their knowledge with us and the iTolosa development team. Together, and thanks to our co-producer Universcience, we developped Termitia. And now we hope you will enjoy discovering the incredible termites nets architecture, realize that termites are far more than nasty pests that eat wood, just as we did working on this project!\r\n</p><p>\n</p><p>More informations about the project can be found \r\n\there . </p><p>(<em>All in french at the moment, but I'll try to translate soon</em>)\r\n</p><p><em>Warning : this game contains scenes that might not be suitable for young audiences </em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/36c/36c1da6ab2e51889edbf85cc157f64c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 152, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Science Animation"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
