It was later released for the Atari ST and MS-DOS. It was developed by the UK-based company Fissionchip Software, and published in Europe by Addictive Games and in the USA by Cinemaware. Unusually for a video game, the game is based on a play, The Kristal of Konos, written in 1976; the authors of the play worked together with the game developers and the play was never shown in theatres or on film before the game's release. A dialog introducing the setting recorded by Patrick Moore, who introduced both the game and play.</p>\n<p>The player takes the role of a pirate named Dancis Frake, on a mission to recover the \"Kristal\" on behalf of the Kring of Meltoca.</p>\n<p>The game features a number of different classic game genres merged: fighting, space flight/combat, and (to a limited extent) LucasArts-style point-and-click adventuring.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a95/a956722a8cf7692b0313083cea662b93.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 3, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 290, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Commodore / Amiga", "PC", "Atari ST"], "developers": ["Fissionchip Software"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Cinemaware", "Addictive Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
