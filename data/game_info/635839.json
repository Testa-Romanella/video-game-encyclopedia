This is our first project. From the beginning we wanted to create a program, similar to classical board games, that we can play together, with some additions:<br/></p>\n<p>First, procedurally generated maps.</p>\n<p>Second, an ability to watch battles between computer controlled opponents, without our input.<br/></p>\n<p>The program is written in C, with only SDL library used for graphics.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T07:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af09c7627a79bdc3888ca37642c200dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["armies and castles"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
