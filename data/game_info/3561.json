The primary task is to explore the caves, collecting as many treasures as possible, avoid the traps of enemies. </p>\n<p>A spelunker can whip or jump on opponents to defeat them, can pick up items from the ground that can be thrown at the enemy. You can also set various traps and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to move through the caves. A notable feature is that the levels are randomly generated and grouped into four complexes &quot;areas&quot;, each of which has a different set of items, enemies, terrain types and special functions.</p>\n<p>The player may also encounter girls who are in difficulty. They can be taken away and attributed to the exit. If you successfully perform this action - health will be replenished. You can unlock the girl as a playable character; the gameplay is identical, except that, playing for her, you meet spelunkers on the way to salvation. Another aspect that can be unlocked - &quot;Tunnel man&quot;, which is present the mattock instead of the whip.</p>", "metacritic": 90, "released": "2012-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-06T12:05:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fad/fadc4be043ed07904012d47cd02671e4.jpg", "website": "http://spelunkyworld.com", "rating": 3.69, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 208, "owned": 3721, "beaten": 158, "toplay": 82, "dropped": 407, "playing": 41}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 79, "ratings_count": 632, "suggestions_count": 410, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 636, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "PC", "PlayStation 4", "PS Vita"], "developers": ["Mossmouth"], "genres": ["Indie", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Mossmouth"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
