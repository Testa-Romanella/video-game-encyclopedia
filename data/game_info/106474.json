Made for Yuri Jam 2016.</p><p>Story:</p><p>\"You wake up, disoriented. Oh, right.</p><p>You were about to be hit by a bus. Did it hit you? Are you dead?</p><p>As you start to gain more or awareness, you hear a voice near you. Looking down, you see a blue katana.</p><p>It was talking.</p><p>...Maybe you are dead.\"</p><p>Currently, it's a bit of a dungeon crawler. Also, an RPG, though there's only one currently.</p><p>Basically everything is placeholder, and it lacks music/sound effects, but I don't think there's any bugs. If there are, please leave me a comment so I can fix it!</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Art/Writing/Dubious Coding: Me</p><p>RPG system: Cheerymoya</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/542/5427311059a839ce4100a319390244af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mink"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
