Most levels will require you to create specific number of molecules using all of the atoms in the room. Others will require you to create specific molecule, e.g. water\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t How to play <br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe goal of the game is to solve puzzles by forming molecules via bonding atoms. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIn order to form a complete molecule, all atoms within the molecule must be satisfied.\r\n\t(If you are familiar with chemistry, it is known as the octet rule.) \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor example, hydrogens require 1 bond to be satisfied.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can form a molecule by bonding 2 hydrogen atoms. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tOxygens require 2 bonds to be satisfied.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tYou can form a molecule by double bonding 2 oxygen atoms.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tNitrogens require 3 bonds to be satisfied and carbons require 4 bonds to be satisfied.\r\n\tYou can form a molecule by triple bonding 2 nitrogen atoms.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tHowever, 2 carbons alone may not form a molecule as 3 is the maximum number of bonds between 2 atoms.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe following is a sample puzzle in the game.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t What's not finished? <br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t I think I finished the basic structure of the game. I, however, want to add more levels, more mechanics, and polish the game in terms of visuals, audio, and level progression. \r\n\tMy ultimate goal is to publish my game to Steam and Google Play. \r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t Credits <br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tI want to thank following people for allowing me to use their assets.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p><ol>\n<li>\r\n\thttps://www.freesound.org/people/rhodesmas/\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSound effect after solving the puzzle. \r\n\t</li>\n<li>https://www.freesound.org/people/LittleRainySeason...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tSound effect after failing the puzzle.\r\n\t</li>\n<li>http://kenney.nl/assets\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tNumber of visual and audio assets were used.\r\n\t</li>\n<li>http://www.dafont.com/des-gomez.d3925\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tDes Gomez/prada12988@yahoo.com\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tCreator of Slime Season and Potion Fushia font. \r\n\t</li>\n<li>https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1951/audi...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tNumber of audio assets were used \r\n\t</li>\n<li>http://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/72352/going-...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tGoing To The Moon by LivingInSilence \r\n\t</li>\n<li>http://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/91797/relaxi...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tRelaxing Synth by HxnHxHxn\r\n\t</li>\n<li>http://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/98499/future...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tFuture Bass Pluck by ebae \r\n\t</li>\n<li>https://thenounproject.com/\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBomb by Edward Boatman from the Noun Project\r\n\t</li>\n</ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cc/9cc841a73e8c9c559f3c1e5571bec9ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["MidnightBisons"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
