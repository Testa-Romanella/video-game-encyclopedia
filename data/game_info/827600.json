{"id": 827600, "slug": "war-of-the-geeks", "name": "War of the Geeks", "name_original": "War of the Geeks", "description": "<p>War of the Geeks is a game made\u00a0in 48 hours\u00a0by Anthony Tambrin (copet80)\u00a0and Min\u00a0Guo during\u00a0a hackathon.</p>\n<p>It's a (very) casual\u00a0action battle game, but there is neither blood nor gore\u00a0here, only armies of\u00a0cute sprites fighting each other and spewing out stars upon being hit.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>Choose\u00a0one from six available\u00a0teams to play with, each with a unique weapon and attack,\u00a0and command your team units to battle against five opponent teams all at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When your team \"kill\" other team units, they transform into your units, growing yours and shrinking them. Your mission is then: dominate the other teams until all of them become yours.</p>\n<p>Strategise, dominate, and win!</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Use the mouse (or trackpad) to point at a specific location on the ground\u00a0(indicated by the war banner) to move your team units\u00a0to that point. Click the left mouse button\u00a0to command them to attack at that point.</p>\r\nDev Story\r\n<p>Thank you for reading up till this point. We salute you!</p>\n<p>The story behind this game is a playful take on the culture and interactions between\u00a0the dev teams that I was working with at the time, where they had healthy internal competitions on time and quality to deliver. During a short period of time before the hackathon, we observed\u00a0that we love broadcasting dev stats such as \"number of bugs reported vs fixed\" and\u00a0\"number of features shipped\". It was a period of experimental fun.</p>\n<p>Based on this concept of\u00a0\"competition\" between devs, we thought it would be fun to re-imagine these teams (which adopt wacky names such as Team Sword, Team Scissors, team Paper, Team Hammer,\u00a0Team Longbow, Team Rock)\u00a0wearing Viking helmets, swords, hammers, and axes, where they would be fighting\u00a0each other in a role-playing manner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So for the hackathon, we aptly named the character teams and set their weapons to be the\u00a0exact dev team name. Most of the team names conveniently signify their weapons and thus their\u00a0attack\u00a0patterns, except for\u00a0\"Team Paper\". After much deliberation,\u00a0we decided that the concept of\u00a0papers \"burning\" seems cooler than cutting\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-29T12:15:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/724/7241c2ba1a709a5fcdd3660182e5a9fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anthony Tambrin"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
