The game includes grim environments and unsettling ambience. Every aspect of the game is designed to present a story with symbolism\u00a0and analogies. The player will control a character who wakes up in a morgue and doesn\u2019t know where she is. The purpose and backstory will be discovered through minimal environmental storytelling and notes scattered around the environment. To progress, the player will need to solve puzzles while uncovering the truth behind the condition that the character is in. Storytelling and puzzles are interlinked with each other and will serve various purposes in gameplay. The focus is heavily on storytelling and providing a short but satisfying experience with impressive usage of story, symbolism, puzzles, music and sound and their implementation into the game experience to provide a realistic, relatable, and somewhat emotional narrative.</p>\n\n<p>The controls are simple and easy-to-learn. Since the purpose of the game is to tell a story through the usage of environmental storytelling and display of symbols through objects, the controls are suited to aid the goal of the game which is to create a slow-paced gameplay experience that will allow the player to observe the surroundings and make sense of the game\u2019s environment and story.
