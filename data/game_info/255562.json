To get off the tomato you need to pick up customers and force them to make a bridge down to the ground. It's too early in the morning and you don't have time to be stuck on a tomato so go get those customers!  <br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>In this prototype version you cant actually drive down the bridge of people. its just a little proof of concept so you can drive around and interact with things on the tomato.<br/></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is my first 3D game, made entirely in unity. Models made all in maya. Hope you enjoy it<br/></strong></p><p><strong>JAMES C. has a game out too called ROCKMAN'S UNIVERSE and its super cool</strong></p><p><strong>check it out here https://jamecz.itch.io/</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e8d/e8d23e1588f77115edb806cdb00b0976.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Roarty"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
