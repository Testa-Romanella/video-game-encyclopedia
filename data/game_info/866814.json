The theme was \"There was... and there was not.\"</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p>Mow your way through a flourishing environment filled with\u00a0trees, fences and distortion vortexes using a rapid firing minigun. Acquire points for each element destroyed, racing against the clock for a high score. Occasionally warp to a mirror dimension, void of all life apart from the Eye of Distortion. Find and defeat the eye in order to return to the dimension where there was life. It is only a matter of time before there is nothing, whether from the eye's doing or yours.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>WASD = Move</p>\n<p>Space = Jump</p>\n<p>Mouse = Look Around</p>\n<p>Hold Left Mouse Button = Fire Minigun</p>\n\r\nTeam Credits:\r\nTimothe Lafond\u00a0\r\n<p>Timothon#3678<br/></p><p>Programmer, Game Designer, Technical Artist</p>\r\nAbdallah Said \r\n<p>low budget RATIRL#7655<br/></p><p>UI Programmer, Level Designer, Sound Designer</p>\r\nLe Cherng Lee\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n<p>KuroiRaku \u9ed2\u3044\u697d#0870<br/></p><p>Programmer, Composer</p>\r\nYuqi Xie\r\n<p>Yuqi#8539<br/></p><p>Concept Artist, UI Artist, Narrative Designer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-17T10:12:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d64/d649997d2f45ebc11f30e765f047557e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timothon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
