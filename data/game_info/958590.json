To this end we have hand crafted a level in which machines are both necessary and lethal to our protagonists journey to find the surface. The very same surface the city in which he was born and raised shows as nothing but a barren apocalyptic wasteland. The game opens with an explanation of past events, such as the beginning of the substitution of human labour and a susbsequent revolution against this, quickly followed by violent retaliation from the automatons that now controlled and were responsible for every facet of production of goods, military applications and many more.</p>\n<p><strong>We hope you enjoy the game! </strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-17T18:56:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b1e/b1e4a0e59d344b979f3523985daa581e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["trqz", "derefepo", "Hugo Filipe", "antonioleite", "Tjack G.", "Sandro Aguiar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
