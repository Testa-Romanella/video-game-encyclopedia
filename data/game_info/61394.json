To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge.<br/><br/>Math Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution.<br/><br/>In the game the player never loses. There is simply a parameterizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much.<br/><br/>Math Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b29/b29539a4d92600460adfb91b22225592.jpg", "website": "https://titandscompany.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 8}, "playtime": 10, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 320, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Titan Deep Space Company"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Titan Deep Space Company"], "esrb_rating": null}
