I had very limited time so many ideas were cut due to time.\u00a0<strong>There will be bugs.</strong> At the current time you just fly around and collect all the coins before time runs out. There are 5 levels in total. I'll admit, it's not fun in the slightest, but it works. And right now that's all that is important because I had a deadline. If people actually care about this I'll make some big updates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T04:00:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5fcd3e8c0a51856295fe2be39e6028e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hexatunes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
