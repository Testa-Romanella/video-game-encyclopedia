You are standing on top of a pole, while all around you, enemies are trying to bring your pole down by any means necessary. The goal is to stay upright for as long as possible. Walk along the top of the pole to keep it balanced, or dash into it for an extra-powerful boost! If you or the pole hit the ground, it's game over.</p>\n<p><strong>Dashing tips:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The dash can only be performed in the air.</li><li>Hitting the platform with a dash causes any climbing enemies to fall off the pole.</li><li>A dash is more powerful if you hit the platform closer to its edge, or at an angle that is closer to the direction you want the platform to go!<br/>\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay:</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>Arrow keys/WASD to walk left and right<br/>Up arrow/W to jump<br/>Click to dash toward the mouse cursor<br/>Esc to pause</p>\n<p><strong>Made by:</strong><br/>Art: Vinicius Vargas<br/>Audio: Elias Reuter<br/>Code: Birdwards</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c0/0c03d6fead5bf7cae36d0f5eb54f1a28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Birdwards", "ElliotRanger", "kekbazuca"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
