If the game doesn't work for you, please let me know what resolution you're playing on so I can try to fix it in future versions. Also, the MAC build is untested so I'm sorry if it doesn't work.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was a 2 week uni project that I am going to continue working on in the near future. We were to make a game about personal experiences, so I chose to make a game that tries to convey the feeling of being LGBT. Specifically, trying to hide that fact from your parents.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry for the bad art, I'll replace it eventually but I ran out of time because of bugs and other stuff. I'll also be adding more to the game over time as well.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/558ae895b7519fd5717107d6cfcc424c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tristan Shaw"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
