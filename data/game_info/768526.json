The purpose of it is to help me in creating and finishing projects and then being able to release them. I have done another game development challenge where I created a game in 30 minutes and then released it on Android phones!\r\n</p>\n<p>Neon Dimensions is a 3D Sci-fi puzzle game. There are 5 levels that progressively increase in difficulty. To help you along your way, there is a robot called Mr. Willy that helps you figure out what you need to do in each level to complete it!\r\n</p>\n<p>In preparation for the release of Neon Dimensions, I have also created a Youtube video outlining how I was able to make this game in 1 week! Here is the link if you want to check it out:\r\n</p>\n<p>Neon Dimensions is completely free to download although it would be much appreciated for donations if you want to see more game development challenges in the future!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T07:14:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/598/598d5040387525b16bba6dfeecab6186.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 136, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Romilio Games"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
