Its FREE!<br/><br/>Orbsorb is an original central defence arcade game about focus, control and high scores.<br/><br/>Defend your Orbsorber from incoming, different coloured ORBs. Gain points for defence and even more points for letting the same coloured ORBs pass by your shield. Try to keep control and focus as ORB numbers increase, ORBs quicken and special ORB attacks bombard your Orbsorber. <br/><br/>Use a classic joystick style control scheme to achieve endless high scores. As you learn to keep calm and stay focused, control and precision will be your greatest advantage. <br/><br/>MAIN FEATURES:<br/><br/>- Universal app for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.<br/>- Endless gameplay with endless combinations.<br/>- Colourful and clean design.<br/>- Original atmospheric techno soundtrack.<br/>- Game Center achievements and leaderboards.<br/>- Created with Sprite Kit.<br/>- Optimised for iPhone 5, 5C &amp;amp; 5S. <br/>- Requires iOS 7.0 or above.<br/><br/>CREDITS:<br/><br/>Code, Design &amp;amp; Art - Montgomery Guilhaus <br/>Music &amp;amp; Sound Effects - Rebecca Guilhaus", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e16/e16a6ac94632a7b2d7d303408644ae8a.jpeg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Montgomery Guilhaus"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Montgomery Guilhaus"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
