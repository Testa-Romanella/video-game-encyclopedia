This \n      collection of games was available on portable LCD devices, and each \n      title featured a game and a clock. Each Game &amp; Watch title features two \n      modes of play: GAME A (normal difficulty) and GAME B (more advanced \n      play). While some controls have been changed in the DSiWare version to \n      better suit the Nintendo DSi system, the appearance of the game itself \n      has not been altered.\n    </p><p>\n      Donkey Kong is trapped!
