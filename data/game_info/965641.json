The main game allows more kingdoms and cities on procedurally generated campaign maps<br/><br/><br/>In the Prologue the two kingdoms are very much alike. In the main game, you choose to play as one of several kingdoms that each has their own set of islands and cities. The main kingdoms all have similar unit types, but each has their own unique flavour, with strengths and weaknesses for you to use strategically<br/><br/><br/>Build up your cities by constructing buildings, gathering resources and training units for your garrison from the world map. Will your cities be economic powerhouses producing loads of resources? Or will they be military training camps designed to get a variety of new units into your armies?<br/><br/><br/>Train units for your armies on the world map, then send them into battle and command them on the battlefield to achieve victory in siege and field combat. Will you build a balanced army capable of engaging in close quarters or at a distance? Or will you focus on ranged units to strike down the enemy from afar?<br/><br/><br/>Techs are unlocked in the Prologue, allowing a subset of the units and buildings you will find in the main game. The techs focus on unlocking and upgrading new buildings and units, as well as enabling automatically spawned units like siege weapons when besieging a city so you don't have to drag them along with your army", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-08-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-01T03:31:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/28b/28bc6af3d0bca7045eaa7bd85234c23c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 21}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 12, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 255, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bad Logic Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["Bad Logic Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
