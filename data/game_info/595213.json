We'll leave behind some \"presents\" and deepen some misunderstandings. Like cats offering presents.</p>\n<p>Cats are amazing.</p>\n<p>But we don't want the humans getting too suspicious, so it's three (3) presents per household. But which three?</p>\n<p>Pick wisely. Each relationship is unique and not all \"presents\" are treated equal.</p>\n<p>Destroy relationships, ruin love, and shut down the city's power.
