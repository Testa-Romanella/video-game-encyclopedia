You should take advantage of where the blocks fall to make your way up the tower. Along the way, you can use some powerups to help you on your journey.</p>\n<p>The story of Stresstris was not fully developed but it is present in the current prototype.</p>\n<p>You are a college student trying to climb your way up the tower of responsibilities all the way to graduation. Along the way, you will find other platforms that represent assignments and money (a Job), things that would be in the life of a college student. The last platform is your graduation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make sure to pick up the assignments and the money, they will be in their own platforms on the side. Not completing will cause an increase of pressure and anxiety on the playable character represented by the recurrent black filter on the screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you decide to play the game, have fun and I hope you enjoy the ride.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-05T07:17:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ceb/ceb5b8b93598d13a1ed02e88bd6b26a3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Gabe Salles"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
