There's nothing more anxiety-inducing than a threat you cannot see. As humans, we always want to make sense of things. Well, let me warn you. In this game, you can't. Please wear headphones, as you will need to follow the sound. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the fright of your life~<br/></p>\n<p>So, I recently watched The Blair Witch Project and I LOVED it! One of the reasons, among many others, that it was so scary, is that they never show the witch. They let your mind come up with what it looks like, based on loose descriptions. A problem that I face with game development is modeling and rigging. That's why the monster in Fever Dreams was a \"robot\". I realized that I don't even need to show the monster for it to be scary. In fact, NOT showing it is scarier. So the idea for Fear of the Unknown was born!</p>\n<p>It's still in very early development, but I made sure to make what little there is the best I could, so I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T06:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9de/9de61fab9e7b4aff5202194828750cb9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["blooperss"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
