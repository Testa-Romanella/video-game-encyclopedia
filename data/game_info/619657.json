It features two <strong>adorable characters</strong>, one rusty string that powers your defences, and <strong>waves upon waves of enemies to fend off</strong>. Keep your towers close to each other or the string will stretch and snap off! <strong>Protect the castle at all costs</strong> and kill the crusaders\u00a0before they make it to the end and your string. <em>\"We also apologise\u00a0if the towers do more harm to each other than the crusaders themselves.\" - Head of Defence Manufacturing.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>**Controls** Use WASD for the Rook and arrow keys for the Bishop.</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0<strong>**Credits** One String Attached</strong> is made by <strong>Ferhanzo </strong>and <strong>bucketfish</strong> for <strong>GMTK Game Jam:\u00a02021</strong>.
