The Game Boy Advance (GBA) version, a miniature golf game, was developed by Vicarious Visions and released on October 10, 2006 in North America. The Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable (PSP) versions, an action adventure game and a platform game respectively, were both developed by Amaze Entertainment and were released on October 24, 2006 and November 21, 2006. It is the second game to be based on the film.<br />\nThe plot of the GBA version focuses on Hammy, a hyperactive squirrel from Over the Hedge, who learns how to play golf after his cable goes out, while the PSP version follows Hammy&#39;s attempts to get his cable back, and the DS iteration follows the characters&#39; attempts to get Boris the Beaver material for his dam. Hammy Goes Nuts! received mediocre reviews for all of its versions; the DS and PSP versions were criticized for generic elements and control issues, while the GBA game was brought down from its repetitive nature and low amount of content.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-10-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T23:42:28", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 3, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 3, "platforms": ["Game Boy Advance", "PSP"], "developers": ["Nintendo", "Vicarious Visions", "Amaze Entertainment", "Game Boy Advance", "PSP"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Activision Blizzard"], "esrb_rating": null}
