This is probably due to framerate issues that weren't considered since this was never a problem in the original build of the game.</li><li>Stamina also seems to regenerate incredibly slowly due to WebGL framerate limitations which could be easily fixed but I'm lazy and ready to move on to another project. Play the original if you want the proper experience.</li><li>The WebGL port of Sprite Fight does not work very well but it exists to demo the main idea of the game to those who are interested.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T13:30:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/672/67212567b2fc58dc22e8331fdf3afdc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kyle Lukaszek"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
