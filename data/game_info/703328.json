If you have played Chainsaw Warrior or Munchkin, this should feel similar.</p>\n<p>The drawings are by me, with some creature ideas and illustrations suggested by playtesters and others.</p>\n<p>The cards are intended to be designed in a way where, even without reading the rule book, they can serve as a form of inspiration or play with one's own rules.</p>\n<p>I plan to\u00a0continue playtesting and refining this, with the help of playtesters who will be credited, and prepare modules for the following engines:<br/></p>\n<ul><li> Tabletop Simulator (v0.01 deck fronts available for download above)</li><li>\u00a0Tabletopia</li><li>VASSAL Engine</li><li>Physical version (if there is enough interest and sponsorship after enough playtesting, refinement, and expansion\u00a0)</li></ul>\n<p>I'm far from done with this game. It's attracted interest in concept, and I want to work on the prototype and produce a product that meets that interest and hope.</p>\n<p>I also want to work on writing descriptions and visions better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T08:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa58d6408df236bd5b799580ec16266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bechstein"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
