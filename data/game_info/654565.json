I originally released this game in July 1993.</p>\n<p>Hideous was originally named\u00a0Sentinel and was inspired by the\u00a0game Zamzara for Commodore 64. My most ambitious game to date, Sentinel took many months of work and\u00a0was signed to a start-up publisher during development, but the publisher vanished overnight when the game was finished, so it was renamed and released as licenceware by 5th Dimension Software.</p>\n<p>The game is generally joystick controlled and you have several weapons at your disposal:\u00a0Space for smart bomb, right shift for missile, left shift for mine web, pull down and hold for death scream.\u00a0Hideous struggles with\u00a0\u00a0graphical glitches and appears to be most stable on v1.2 Amiga 500 systems.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T13:10:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4da/4da98e3a9c1df37a3bb80cc4b2c7fbf3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
