All the music and art is by me!<br/>Font: Fuzzy Bubbles by Robert Leuschke<br/>SFX:\u00a0Cartoon Character Slurp, Cartoon Success Fanfare,\u00a0Stomach Gurgle from ZapSplat.com</p>\n<p>The game is not easy, and the fun fact displayed on the win screen is randomized from 18 possibilities, so it's possible that you'll never see every fact displayed through playing. You can view all of the facts here if you would like!<br/></p>\n<p>v1.0 (12/25/2021): I got tired of working on it :') We'll see if I ever update the game.</p>\n<p>v1.1 (12/26/2021): Displays properly in windowed mode now, thanks Aaron! (Oops, Grabb's tail is cut off now, and chameleon tails don't regenerate...) I centered the fun fact text and am for now ignoring the UI problems Athena pointed out :)<br/></p>\n<p>Known issues:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Doesn't display properly if screen isn't 1980x1080 (fixed in v1.1)</li><li>Noted by Ming: Tongue goes berserk as a result of rapid mouse movement. Maybe when the tongue retracts but the head gets spun around very quickly, something doesn't reset properly.</li><li>Noted by Athena: The UI might be a little off anchor-wise.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T05:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ec/4eca3f369786439989c70df9371c2c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ray Hsiao"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
