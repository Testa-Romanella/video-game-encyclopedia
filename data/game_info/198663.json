But I was inspired so I let it go all the way...</p>\n<p>The theme was \"<strong>Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing\"</strong> . It's a quote from Wernher von Braun. He was a german engineer who made the V2 rocket during the World War 2 and the Saturn V rocket later. He kind of let his print foot on the Earth I think...</p>\n<p>So I decided to make a game about 2 sides who are launching to each other V2 rockets. The player has to choose the power of the rocket by clicking on one of the 4 buttons on the upper left corner.</p>\n<p>If you win, you have a prize. If you loose, ... you loose, that's all... ;-)</p>\n<p>Credits : <br/>Saturn V picture : Rawdanitsu : http://opengameart.org/users/rawdanitsu</p>\n<p>PS : After this Game Jam, I'll continue on this developpement.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a6/2a6b74c1ef8b737f03857cf045f2cf54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kthulhu1947"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
