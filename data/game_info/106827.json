It is inspired by The Jungle Book (1894), a collection of short stories, best known for the adventures of a feral child raised by wolves in the jungles of India, and fighting against an evil tiger.</p><p><strong>In my twisted modern 3D action/platformer interpretation</strong>, Mowgli (the feral child) is raised by flying squirrels in the Boreal Forest in Canada, and is heading to meet her bear friend named Baloo. Shere Khan (the tiger) is represented by tiger-striped logging machines that are destroying the forest. Mowgli must leap through the trees to warn her forest friends in time for them to escape their impending doom.</p><p><strong>Unfinished </strong>- I ran out of time. There's just a tutorial and beginning, but no middle or end of the story. However there is a whole forest to explore. If you make it all the way to the end of the map (where you can see the far northern edge of the world) before the machines do, then consider yourself a winner! This would have been the plot if I had more time.</p><p>I didn't get a chance to make the respawn feature either, so press R to reload the level. (It messes up the FPS meter though).</p><p>I was originally making this game based on Tarzan, but found out late in the jam that Tarzan is not public domain even though it was written in 1912. I lost 2 days of the jam reworking it into Jungle Book.</p><p>Timelapse videos of the game development</p><p><strong>Attributions:</strong></p><ul><li>Ouch and Battle Cries sounds by 11linda.
