This is a rapid-pressing track &amp; field game where you're task is to run an entire 26.2 mile marathon.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>How long will that take? Who knows, the current world record for the world's fastest marathon run is 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds. While I cannot guarantee the distance you travel and speed in-game will reflect reality, I would be surprised if you could complete the game in under a marathon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>If you do, provide a screenshot, else then let me know how far you got before either giving up or passing out from lack of energy.</p>\n<p>You have three options:</p>\n<p>* Press A and D keys in sequence.<br/>* Press Left and Right keys in sequence.<br/>* Press A and B on a gamepad in sequence.</p>\n<p>The faster you press, the faster you go.</p>\n<p>Other controls include pressing T to switch your distance from miles to meters, and R will reset the marathon.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a9/2a98dff85b2e008589d8b919e27fffbe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
