And guess who has it? The kid, who else. Peace was never an option.<br/></p>\n<p>Chase and try to catch that little trouble maker as he runs from you going around your house with YOUR PHONE. Grab things he hates like vegetables and books to force him to stop in his tracks, but avoid giving him things like comics so that he doesn't get an edge on you. The above score will let you know how well (or bad) you are doing: reaching a score of ten catches the kid, but go below zero and you'll let him get away.</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p><strong>Ian Klaere Fernandez</strong> <strong>(Art Animations/Game Design)</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Instagram: @ianklaere99</li><li>https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-klaere-b77210199/</li><li>https://twitter.com/IKlaere</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Jasmin Stahn (Code)<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>https://www.instagram.com/_marrysoul_/</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Holly Lowe (Art Assets/Background/Menus)</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>https://www.instagram.com/hcjlowe/?hl=en</li></ul>\n<p>For:\u00a0</p>\r\nUniversity of Applied Sciences Europe\u00a0\r\n<p>This game was created at the\u00a0Game Design // UE\u00a0at the\u00a0University of Europe for Applied\u00a0Sciences.
