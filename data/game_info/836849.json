If the game breaks, you need to click the flag twice. This is a Kirby game based on, but not 1:1 with, Kirby's Dreamland 3. Coding Kirby is much more complex than Mario so this game is relatively short. I will likely make more Kirby games in the future, and try to make them longer. For people that are interested: There are 5 different abilities Kirby can use in this game, I wanted to add the ice ability, but I couldn't find the sprite(s) the enemies used when they were frozen so that sucks. I hope you enjoy the game regardless. Also, I know that Burning is OP, but it's too fun to nerf. The animated thumbnail had to be removed since the project got marked as NFE because of it. Thanks to Nintendo / HAL Laboratory for making Kirby and the resources used in this project. Sprites: https://www.spriters-resource.com/ Music: https://downloads.khinsider.com/ Sounds: </p>\n<p> (some sounds used in this game are wrong since it is extremely hard to find sounds when the only source is a 4 minute long mp3. I had to listen to it every time I needed another sound, so some are just 'good enough' as I didn't want to listen through it more than I needed to.)
