Deadwood is a small, close-knit town hidden behind an eerie and ominous forest. According to Deadwood residents, a malevolent witch makes their home in the woods and despises trespassers of all kinds. For this reason, many refuse to venture into the forest, but they do believe the terrifying witch is behind the missing townspeople. Through exploration, it is up to the player to discover what happened to the missing people and unravel the mysteries of the witch and Deadwood.</em></p>\n<p><em>Deadwood</em>,\u00a0 by studio Dead Games.</p>\n\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Development &amp; Programming - Skye G.; Narrative Team - Ty F., Kale S., Larnell B.; Character Writing - Ty; Art Assets &amp; Character/Map Design - Maddie L.; Game Design - All.</p>\n<p>Third-Party Assets Used:</p>\n<p>DialogueBox BG Image - SunnyLand (Unity Asset Store); Cobwebbed - Purple Planet Music; Footstep SFX - littlerobotsoundfactory.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T21:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a36/a365daa72e51dee9414897f303f56ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Skye"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
