After a lot of testing and creating prototypes this turned out to be <em>Twiggy and the SkillScaler.</em> As opposed to a lot of 3D Platformers or other genres of video games. There are some things that this game will do differently!</p>\n<p><em>Don't worry! Because we will explain everything as soon as possible</em></p>\r\nStory\r\n\r\n<p>A cursed asteroid hit the planet and it corrupted our entire world, you are the only one who can rescue the entire planet. You are the only living being that can save my life, you are the only being who's able to learn multiple skills.</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong> <strong>DO</strong> <strong>NOT</strong> <strong>forget!</strong> </p>\n<p>You are the last living part of me, you will need to keep your skill level up to keep remember the skills you learned</p>\n<p><em>\"Please remember me Twiggy! You are the only being who can save this planet, you are the only one who can save me!\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I hope to see you again\"</em></p>\n\r\nSkills\r\n\r\n<p>Like I already said, there will be at least five skills available, when we reach more milestones right here on Kickstarter and with the feedback of all of you, I might be able to include some of your ideas in the game.</p>\n<p>The currently planned skills are: Bouncing, Dashing, Sneaking, Punching, Throwing, but in this current demo only one world and one skill are included</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T11:10:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ff/0ff701c61f2527f37dfbc74f1761e3d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Junglett Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
