Yeah it\u2019s gonna be a mix of the 2 plus some new features added in. I also took inspiration from the Atari 8-bit personal computer system version.</p>\n<p>Download the manual here (preview has issues but is still readable): https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9aBX97zgGJ0TXdMcXJybmRWaFU</p>\n<p>Difficulty options:</p>\n<ul><li>Easy: Slowest enemies, Bandits don\u2019t appear during the first night and destroy other ships when shot</li><li>Normal: Normal speed enemies, Bandits don\u2019t appear during the first night</li><li>Hard: Faster enemies, Bandits appear in the first night</li><li>Contest: Fastest enemies, Bandits appear during the first night and destroy other ships when shot. Also different font and scoring.</li></ul>\n<p>A few words about the game. Atlantis was one of the first games I wanted to remake but I dropped the project due to lack of motivation (it was gonna be in a package with a Missile Command and Exed Exes remake, though that one was solely based on the 2600 version). This one here is completely redone cause I no longer have the files for my old version (other than the screenshot below), graphics or the game, though I tried to imitate the original style I had, with some improvements.</p>\n<p>There are things I wasn\u2019t terribly happy about but with the direction I\u2019m taking it, I feel I\u2019ve done the best I could without ruining the game or having to do a completely do-over which would probably cause me to lose motivation for finishing this game entirely (long story on that), so I wanted to do the smaller fixes and push this game along to be released.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-28T05:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b8/3b850e1b74ec8c819912c3429b0ca8c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tangentg"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
