Bla\u017eevi\u0107, but most people just call me by my nickname, <strong>Ryu</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p>This game contains some content from my fantasy book (Ervenfell - The Alteration). <br/></p>\n<p>I made this short and rather fast game in 12 days (124 hrs says steam) for the No Travel Game Jam 2020. <br/></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy a quick jump into my fantasy world </p>\n\n<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>:</p>\n<p>In <em><strong>Ervenfell - Crimson Plague</strong> </em>you play as Zara, a young Lighelf girl from Planin village, who is a novice healer/priestess of Myla [Goddess of Mercy].</p>\n<p>Things prove to be a bit difficult when a sickness, a plague, suddenly appears and threatens to spread all across of Ervenfell.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Characters:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Main:</em></p>\n<p>Zara: A young Lightelf, the main character</p>\n<p>Myla: The Goddess of Mercy</p>\n<p>The Order of Spellswords: A powerful group of abomination slayers visiting Planin village [Koib, Nami, Mave, Zirah, Iyo, Azra and Ryu (self insert confirmed xD)].</p>\n<p><em>Other:</em></p>\n<p>Many villagers, shop keepers and travelers at the inn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>-Playtime- is up to players. By skipping (fast forwarding) text and following the quests it will take up to 40min to complete the game, or you could just walk out of the city and get a game over screen.</p>\n<p>-Books- ,all the books. If you feel like reading some more about the world of Ervenfell, you can do so in-game (or buy my book on amazon , even better).</p>\n<p>-Choices- in this game matter, most of the time.</p>\n<p>-No- cursed random encounters by walking around.</p>\n<p>-Story- driven, battles are quick and easy to complete.</p>\n<p>-Hopefully- <strong>you</strong> .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excuses:</strong></p>\n<p>I love the default rpg maker tilesets, always did, and I'm not an artist, but I will admit I would have done more and better, had I not started off so late  barely made it in time as is (tell me if you find any bug/glitch/something that shouldn't happen, so I can correct it).</p>\n<p> <br/> <br/> <br/> </p>\n<p><em>\"Your home\"</em></p>\n<p><strong>End:</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and enjoy the game :)\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>v1.1:</em></strong></p>\n<p>-Fixed cutscene where characters disappeared too soon.</p><p>-Altered the village pre-forest area slightly.</p><p>-Fixed a few npc conversation that were strange.</p><p>-Lowered damage on the evolving plaguelings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-04T07:07:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0c7/0c7b4f53bde90044a1a9b84e183f55d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ryu"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
