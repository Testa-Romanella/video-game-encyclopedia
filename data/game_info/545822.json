It's nothing like the actual board game. Your friends want to play Cursed Monopoly again and it's your job to survive the game and go on with your life. The objective is to collect 200 dollars and pass GO. If you can do this, then you win the game!</p>\n<p>Good luck! This game was actually made in about four days as a sort-of therapy after working so hard on Boofie's Birthday Adventure, so it's pretty short!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:19:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/325/325f5988ff31bd46dec41d880ce06e80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MicroHorrorArcade"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
