That is why you control a Red Deer, and you are fighting against other animals mad at you in an Irish Pub. Fight your way from both sides, dodging the stuff they throw at you and to punch them down before they have a chance to punch you!<br/><strong>Controls - Keyboard/Gamepad</strong><br/>The buttons follow a similar keyboard/gamepad layout as my last #gbjam entry, Galaticus. Therefore, only the descriptions of the keys have been changed.<br/>D-Pad: *WASD or Directional Keys / DPad or Left Analog Stick* - Navigate, Combine with A to Attack (Left/Right), Crouch (Down)<br/>A: *J Key / A Button* - Combine with Directional Keys to Attack<br/>B: *K Key / B Button* - Drink<br/>Start: *Enter / Start Button* - Select, Pause<br/>Press F / Trigger Buttons at any time to toggle full screen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d3/8d3677909f35e2502135e5c1f18875b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gamepopper"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
