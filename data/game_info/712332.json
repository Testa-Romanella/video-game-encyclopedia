I am programming in Construct 2 and creating sprites in MS Paint under her direction. All of the character names, designs, powers, etc are her ideas and begin as her own drawings. She sits next to me and critiques heavily\u00a0as I put the pieces together on her behalf. Honestly, she'd probably do it all herself but programming involves a lot of reading.\u00a0<em><strong>This is Gemma's project, and it was her idea to bring it to life.\u00a0100% of your donations to this project go directly into Gemma's piggy bank. </strong></em>See the devlog for some of Gemma's concept documents.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Reset by clicking/tapping button on icon\u00a0in upper right.</p>\r\nKeyboard\r\n<ul><li>Click the game screen before playing to activate the controls.</li><li>Use arrow keys to move/jump and space bar to bark.</li></ul>\r\nPhone\r\n<ul><li>Use arrow keys to move, up button to jump, x button to bark.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-20T09:17:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa9/fa9f05876f8b72c8aca7a6cb6f86cf32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["donboody"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
