Since the central government\u2019s refusal to offer any concessions on political reform after the Umbrella Revolution of 2014, things seem to be sliding downhill faster and faster. Missing booksellers, legislators disqualified and arrested at the behest of China (and as of 2018, even more disqualifications and bans), and apathy about the very idea of protesting give very few people hope for Hong Kong beyond 2047, when the protections on our \u2018capitalist way of life\u2019 run out.<br/></p>\r\nI may be na\u00efve, but I believe there is yet hope for Hong Kong. How to give others hope, is still something I\u2019m working\u00a0on.\r\n<p>This is more of an interactive museum looking into one possible future of Hong Kong than a true game. From the start, I wanted to describe some current trends while simultaneously bringing them to absurd conclusions in the year 2048.</p>\n<p><strong>HK-2048: what is the future of Hong Kong (Medium),\u00a01 May, 2017</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d9/7d9aea8abba73858b985046eb6af0e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["*AAmici"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
