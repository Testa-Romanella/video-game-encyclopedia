Unfortunately, everyone in the county suddenly disappeared, except for you, your boss, and another employee. The show must go on, so with your new job title of Professional Thing-Doer, it&#39;s up to you to do all of the activities that need to be filmed for the TV station. You should probably try and figure out why everyone disappeared in the first place, too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-04T03:29:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/948/94838f3be25e31129e0e87b091cb6182.jpg", "website": "http://tin.zone/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 5, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 33, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 5", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox Series S/X", "Nintendo Switch"], "developers": ["Tinzone Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Tinzone Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
