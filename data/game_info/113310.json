You can press an arrow key to set her direction. But, she'll find her way if she hits an obstacle.</p><p>UPDATE: Now with slimes! Collide with a slime to defeat it. Once you defeat your first slime, a counter in the top-left corner of the screen will keep track of how many you've gotten.</p><p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p><p>There's lots of overlapping trees.</p><p>When the hero and slimes spawn, they will often spawn on top of or under trees.</p><p>Slimes fly in weird directions when you defeat them.</p><p><strong>Other Info:</strong></p><p>The trees are based off the SNES Zelda trees. Partly because they look cool, partly because I wanted to try out their collision mechanic -- the foliage and roots are separate sprites, and the hero only collides with the foliage.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb12be00c85f298cbbadc5eb4679ba37.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["pancakecity"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
