{"id": 168331, "slug": "glowbot-commander", "name": "Glowbot Commander", "name_original": "Glowbot Commander", "description": "<p>Glowbot Commander is a free top-down shooter with some RTS controls added to the mix. Directly control a robot just like you would in a regular top-down shooter, or give the robot commands like you would in a RTS game. Buy as many robots as you want, upgrade them with different weapons and abilities, and see how many waves you can get through. Choose between 3 difficulty modes. Choose what wave you want to start out on (up to the highest wave you've gotten to), instead of always having to start completely over at wave 1.</p><p>You can also use the built in map editor to edit the maps or create your own.<br/></p><p>The game is everything that I wanted it to be when I set out to create it. However, I still plan on further developing it and adding new features (the game will automatically update itself when these updates are available). Any feedback/suggestions are appreciated. You can leave a comment below or email me at alex@evansalex.com.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/485/485223c26680ac4491a48c5be971b668.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["braingame26"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
