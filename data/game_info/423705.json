The RBG sliders now have a readout which informs the user what level 0-100 the slider is currently set to re: concentration. Day and night can be toggled by hitting the AMPM button, which will switch the background from the default day setting to a black night setting. Sliders which control glow and opacity have as well been added, and will further allow the user to change the quality and appearance of the instantiated primitives. On a downclick the size of the primitives is somewhat randomized, although instantiated primitives can have their size changed via the size slider. The user now has the option to clear all instantiated primitives with an animation to accompany the clearing, and is also able to adjust the time that the primitives exist before disappearing via the destroy slider. This slider as well has an output 1-5 which is displayed on the button directly to its left.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-30T05:09:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/17b/17be6bdaba1c0f9b75bb094f098b3c19.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["matt23x2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
