You've gotta stay on your toes and watch out because danger could come at anytime.<br/><strong>Blindfold-</strong> Players receive a blindfold on spawn. Every so often the blindfold gets removed but only briefly.<br/><strong>Knockout-</strong> Knock opponents out of the arena with some serious firepower. <br/><strong>Breakfloor-</strong> Break the floor... and hope your opponent doesn't do the same... <br/><strong>Trap Master-</strong> Reimagining of a famous game mode.
