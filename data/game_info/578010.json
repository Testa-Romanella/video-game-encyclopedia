The project assignment was to create a 3D\u00a0environment with interactable objects, UI Elements, 3 Sounds, and a Unity Terrain. The most annoying part of this project was the terrain..

This is another platforming game as per usual since those are my favorite games to work on.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T11:39:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c25/c257ff3b184e355ca5fc807ba4a49281.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ephiemus"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
