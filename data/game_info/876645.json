The gimmick is that your control scheme (which starts as WASD) drifts around the keyboard as you play. You need to follow the control drift in order to properly play the levels.</p><p>The keyboard the control scheme drifts across is based on the keyboard I'm currently using. It's possible I missed a couple keys that don't work due to OS functions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T05:35:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/183/183fed3e553d64797f76fda5c131dca0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["bobjrsenior"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
