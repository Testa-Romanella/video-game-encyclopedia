Command a squad of 4 prototypes to protect the Mainframe from infection by an unknown virus. You will have to fight off assaults, destroy fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes, and much more on your way to the deepest areas of the complex. Bypass the limitations and disadvantages of items and create powerful combinations. Destroy opponents with a variety of tactics: overheat them, destroy them with corrosion, absorb damage and shoot back.Don't rely on a single strategy - enemies may have a way to counter it. The Prologue content:<br/><br/><ul><li>6 of 24 mechs,<br/></li><li>90 of 190 items,<br/></li><li>1/3 of missions (1 act).</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><strong>* RETRO STYLE:</strong> Graphics, inspired by 80s terminal PC with hybrid synthwave soundtrack.<br/><br/><strong>* DIVERSE TACTICS:</strong> Cook enemy robots to death, bury them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable strategies in mind.<br/><br/><strong>* BUILD YOUR SQUAD:</strong> Similar to how in card games you have to build your deck, in Mainframe Defenders you have to combine different items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build!<br/><br/><strong>* UNIQUE ENEMIES:</strong> Enemy squad won't sit idle, though. Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies. Pick your targets wisely, or you will lose.<br/><br/><strong>* PROCEDURAL LEVELS:</strong> Hand-made rooms are combined with procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives, combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid the unknown and risk falling behind?<br/><br/><strong>* PROGRESSION SYSTEM:</strong> Victory or defeat, the game is not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs. Unlock new items to bolster your new strategies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Synthetic Domain</strong> is a small team of hobbyists with a passion for making games.
