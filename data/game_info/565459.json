Basically, when you're moving around, a series of lines outlining the tiles I used for the floor may appear.\u00a0 Additionally, you may be initially unable to move until you shoot your gun. Be prepared to turn invisible immediately!</p><p>Feedback is welcome.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:12:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee3/ee38cda78b1b1fa208f01e6add45eb50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["D.Galga"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
