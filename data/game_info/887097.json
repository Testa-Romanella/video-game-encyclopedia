It's easier said than done though, since that rogue goddess from Mario X Minecraft 17 is wreaking lots of havoc.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game combines elements and ideas from: Minecraft, Super Mario Bros. 1-3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Super Mario Maker 1 and 2, and Super Mario Odyssey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game is another experiment with an open-world 2D game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shoutout to Turbowarp because 99% of this project's development took place on Turbowarp. Also big shoutout to @SpideyPlaysMC for his 'Super Mario World Maker' project, which has lots of SMW assets for me to use, saving me the trouble of having to crop them from a sprite sheet myself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out more Mario X Minecraft games here: https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/25427994\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most assets belong to Nintendo and Mojang.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T09:24:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5e7/5e7543906e51a3a3d5ff019a7d2e7118.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 183, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GamingWithDominic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
