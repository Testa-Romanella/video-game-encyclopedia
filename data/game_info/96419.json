When his machine broke down, IT BROKE THE TIME! All the hours and days got mixed up. The machine also scattered those clocks all over professor's lab. This malfunction of time causes time clones to appear. Avoid them to prevent time paradox from happening. Professor's machine also unleashed some sort of Time Lord who is after you.</p><p>In order to repair the time machine and thus the time itself you need to restore all the hours from all the week days. If you manage to collect 24 clocks from Monday-Sunday and defeat the Time Lord, you will save the day.
