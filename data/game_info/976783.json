Dirty Dirty Pirates is a fast-paced, chaotic, player versus player fighting game, where fast reflexes and improvisation will help you become victorious. Stab, throw, roll, dance, mount, catch, and smash your way through frenzied battles in a looped battleground and enjoy the hilarious brutality.<h3>LOCAL-MULTIPLAYER MAYHEM</h3>Brawl with 2-4 players in a top down, blood-soaked, pirate battleground not for the faint of heart. <br/><br/><h3>CHAOTIC LOOPED BATTLEGROUND</h3>You and your thrown weapons wrap around the level, creating chaotic ways to slay your enemies (or yourself)!<br/><br/><h3>POUNCE AND EXECUTE</h3>Mount a downed pirate and choose your killing method. <br/><br/><h3>GRATIFYING KILL CAMS</h3>Watch the final kill of the match in slow motion and celebrate the brutality.<br/><br/><h3>WEAPONS WITH A MIND OF THEIR OWN</h3><br/>Not only are the weapons pointy and eager to impale \u2013 but they follow you! Better hide, catch, or roll, ya buccaneer.<h3>SLAUGHTER IN DIVERSE LANDS</h3><br/>Slay your foes at ship docks, ancient jungle ruins, desert, caves, and icy tundras.<h3>CUSTOMIZE THE CHAOS</h3><br/>Reduce or increase the blood/gore to your liking (or disable it). Color blind mode is available as well. <br/><br/>Please note: This is a local multiplayer game without online gameplay. For the best experience, find a comfy couch and some friendly mateys in the same room or with Steam Remote Play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-16T06:51:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/11254368dc2191bd8423af964c6c1517.jpg", "website": "http://dirtydirtypirates.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 449, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["King Hat"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["King Hat"], "esrb_rating": null}
