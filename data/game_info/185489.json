In order for you to do this\u00a0 you are going to need some help, which is where your family sword, The Hyacinth, comes into play. The Hyacinth and other equipment can be used to defeat enemies and complete objectives. The Fire Bottle, your ranged weapon, must be filled by catching enemies fireballs or finding a container which holds fire. Lastly, the Invisibility Stone which allows you to quickly move past enemies at the cost of health. With these tools by your side and some platforming skills perhaps you can stand a chance!</p>\n<p><strong>Creators Note:</strong></p>\n<p>This game was my first real programming project and I am very proud that I was able to complete it. I learned a lot about programming, game design and project management throughout the production of this game and I can not wait to do more of it. I am happy that this adventure is at its end and I am hoping to move onto bigger and better projects. I hope you have fun playing my little game because I definitely had fun making it.</p>\n<p>-Matthew Long(Squidman)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>The main menu art and logo were created by my friend Wizardman.
