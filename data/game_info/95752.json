It is the subject of a talk by its creator, Mars Ashton, regarding the development of a project in an abandoned game engine that defined independent game development as we know it today.</p>\n<p>This is a personal story. A\r\nstory about my Grandfather\u2019s death, my overworked Father and a world that\r\nexpects so much of you after it all comes crumbling down. A story that has\r\ntaken 10 years to reach a point where it has manifested as a game about\r\nexploring, finding new abilities and items, and then using those discoveries to\r\nexplore <em>deeper</em>. In a game world full\r\nof brilliant blues, vibrant purples, even more colorful characters and tons of\r\ncosmetic options to personalize your character, Axis Descending offers the\r\nopportunity for players to experience a very personal story in a way that they\r\ncan make <em>their own</em>.</p>\n<p>The demo includes several areas to explore, numerous unlocked upgrades and cosmetics to use, and has been built to represent various facets of its own development as a form of \"last respects\" for a dying project.</p>\n<p>This project wouldn't have been possible, even up to this point, without the help of numerous people. While the core demo was built by one person, game creation is truly a collaborative effort and \"gamedev\" extends beyond the core team. I want to thank the following people for helping to make this personal project a beautiful demo, even if it didn't reach the ideal outcome.</p>\n<p>Kim Ashton</p>\n<p>Dylan Packard</p>\n<p>Alex Lanzetta</p>\n<p>Bryce Evans</p>\n<p>Adam Serhane</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:30:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d96/d9666cb243bc2cc6ead63001d255e9d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 207, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mars Ashton"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
