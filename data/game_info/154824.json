Explore a temple and use the clues you find to solve the puzzle.<br/></p><p>STORY:<br/><br/>After years of digging through the dirt, you finally find the entrance to the ancient temple your father wrote about.<br/><br/>Stumbling through the darkness, you fall down a hole and unwittingly trap yourself inside. Getting up, you look around you and see a strange, unrecognisable language on the walls... yet you can read it, as if intuition is unveiling hidden knowledge locked within your mind. How is this possible?<br/><br/>Can you solve the riddle of the temple and escape?</p><p>CONTROLS: Left and right to move, up to jump, space to interact with wheel.</p><p>DEV NOTES:<br/><br/>This was made for multiple jams, and meets three themes: intuition, wheels and dirt, and you are the monster. It was my first platformer, so that was exciting for me!<br/></p><p>It turns out puzzle games are terrible for a jam environment, though. I'm also not very happy with the game. I mean, it's okay enough as a game I guess, but it doesn't really feel like \"me.\"<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a62/a624049f559db3d07cc3911f57a94714.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hulk Handsome"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
