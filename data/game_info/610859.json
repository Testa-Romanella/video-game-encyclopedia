I wanted to participate in this (my first) Game Jam, to try out some new ideas and see what was possible in a weekend.</p>\n<p>I'm a solo game maker and decided for this project that I would try and use only assets that I have made and have created within this 48 hour window. Happy to say that I managed to create 95% of the assets you see in 'Little One' within this Jam period.</p>\n<p>Big <strong>thank you</strong> to the organisers of this Game Jam!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T06:12:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/da3/da3fb9687f49f60c39ef181a8bc349c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["brockjroderick"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Educational", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
