This is a 2D, sprite based marching simulator.  It is intended to give the user what it would feel like to march a military formation, as well as see how well they can do!  You will give commands by keyboard or mouse to a flight of 12.  These 12 must execute 10 commands from a list of 27 within a 70 ft by 70 ft area.  Your score depends on how fast your flight can execute your commands, and how well you stay in your are.  Do you have what it takes?  This is a constant work in progress so any feedback is appreciated.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:57:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e96/e96b19d27dde60b7421b666ad6a04951.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marching Simulator"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Marching Simulator"], "esrb_rating": null}
