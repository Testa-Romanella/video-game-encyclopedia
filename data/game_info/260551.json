The player can collect Marcus' notes, but they aren't saved yet, and can not be read at the moment.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>The fate of Marcus</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A story driven, audio-visual exploration game taking place in a voxels' composed world. In each game, you discover a brand new world, procedurally generated, in which notes from a previous explorer are hidden, telling his story.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The player follows the story of Marcus through his notes scattered all over the world. Marcus was a bored gardener, and when he saw an ad about a space travel to establish a society on another planet, he jumped at the opportunity and boarded right away.<br/></p>\n<p>The world, made of voxels, is composed of forests, cliffs, rivers, and flowers (yes, I love flowers, so you will see a lot of them in the game). I tried to recreate a realistic environment through dynamic fog and wind, affecting both flowers and water. Each time the game start up, a brand new world is generated (but the progression of the player is kept, no worries).</p>\n<p><em>Note</em> : it isn't mandatory to follow the storyline by collecting Marcus' notes, you can just explore the world while listening to the restful soundtrack, I tried to make a game which could help people to relax after a hard day of work. :)<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>There is an in-game tutorial (because it's cool) to explain the commands, but here they are (in case you want to skip it) :</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move on qwerty keyboard, ZQSD on azerty</li><li>Escape to get back your mouse (the game will try to eat it because it loves mouse)</li><li>the god mode can be activated using...\u00a0<em>wait, actually there is no god mode, forget that</em></li><li>Space is used to jump</li><li>U to run/walk</li><li>Zoom with Q (qwerty), A (azerty)</li><li>Left mouse button to put a bloc, right one to destroy a bloc (only the blocs put by the player can be destroyed)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Keyboard and mouse support</li><li>A new world each time you launch the game !</li><li>A story told through notes</li><li>And cookies !\u00a0<em>wait no, we don't have cookies</em></li></ul>\n<p><strong>Configuration needed to run the game</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>64 bits computer</li><li>OpenGL 3.3 and later is required</li><li>At least 1GB of RAM</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Development</strong></p>\n<p>Still going on, I haven't slept or eaten for a month now, but the game is working!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/858/858d0ba3734ec18741013e58c4be539d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["SuperFola"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
