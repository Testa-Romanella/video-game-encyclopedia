The United Nations has disappeared, and in its place an organization with far sharper teeth referred to simply as \"The World Market\" has taken its\u00a0place. Individual Regions are left to fight for power to dominate their neighbors, their countries, their continents, and then the world.\n<br/><br/>\nSupreme Ruler 2010 represents the next generation of strategy game. Not another build and attack 'click fest', but a challenging simulation of political and military leadership. You control the agenda of your region as you maintain its economy, grow the support of your population, and strive to influence your neighbors. Through skilled management your influence and popularity will grow... Will you be a successful diplomat, who can increase your power through an incredibly flexible diplomacy model, or will you be a ruthless and ambitious ruler that lets your tanks and missiles speak for you?Resource realism - resource management has moved beyond the \"chop trees / mine gold\" simplicity. You have the ability to control the manufacturing, consumption, and export of 11 key commodities.\nReal-time or turn-based modes for different play styles.\nHundreds of detailed and accurate military units to control ranging from battalions to entire divisions.\nA revolutionary campaign system with over 40 scenarios and over 200 possible starting regions from virtually anywhere in the world.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:07:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/846/846067f85053b1a793a35db8b893bc8b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 11, "toplay": 3, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 478, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BattleGoat Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["BattleGoat Studios"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
