Made entirely in UE4 with C++ and Blueprints.</p>\n<p>The theme of the game jam was stuck in\u00a0 a loop,\u00a0 using that as inspiration I created a game about trains stuck in a loop, with the twist being that the\u00a0player has control of the route the trains take.\u00a0The objective is to collect resources on the track and navigate the track to drop those resources off at the correct locations. It is game over if you deliver it to the wrong location.</p>\n<p>Use the space bar or game pad left face button to activate the switches to navigate the levels space rails.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately the level design, visuals and UI are all very lacking but it is a game you can \"play\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-09T10:36:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb9/eb95309504b3ffc669079d9c3d94a57f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LD47SpaceTrain"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
