Have you ever pointed a webcam at a monitor displaying that webcam, and gotten trippy effects? That's a bit like what this is, but in 3D!</p>\n<p>I've only tested it with Oculus Rift S, but it uses OpenXR, so it should work across most popular headsets.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I had an idea for a trippy\u00a0 new VR experience, inspired by:\r\n    </p>\n<ol><li>The phone app Fraksl, which uses mirrored and inverted video  feedback to  produce trippy fractal videos. You change the visuals by  pinch  zooming/rotating and panning around. (Play with an online version I made here.)\r\n</li><li>The  VR app Cosmic Flow, which uses trippy mirrored textures on 3D  objects  to produce a very unique 3D kaleidoscope effect. It has an  incredible  shifting sense of depth and space.\r\n</li><li>That cool thing that happens  when you point a webcam at a monitor  displaying the webcam's image  fullscreen, and tilt the camera or move it  closer, further, in circles,  etc. It's a little like Fraksl, but so  much more unsteady due to light  glare, small human movements, etc.\r\n</li><li>The VR app SoundSelf, which  is primarily a meditation aid/teacher that  uses toning and chanting. It  looks a bit like a more dynamic version of  Cosmic Flow, but the way  that it responds to the input from the player  entranced me, literally.  It uses mostly sound and visual feedback, but  also some head motion  feedback to help you know if your gaze is  wandering.\r\n</li><li>Mind  Massaging Machine, which is a meditation/hypnosis VR app that lets  you  use trippy visuals, play audio tracks, and do a few other things  that  aren't relevant. Unfortunately, while I am impressed with the work  that  has been done on the project, I am just not happy with the visual  or  user experience.\r\n</li></ol>\n<p>I'm learning Unity right now in order to develop a VR experience that  uses aspects from all of these. Here are the core mechanics I hope to  implement:\r\n    </p>\n<ol><li>Mapping the player's visual field onto a \"Feedback Texture\" in real-time. This texture will be inverted and hue shifted.</li><li>Having  one or more tunnel(s) that change shape and have mirrored and  tiled  Feedback Texture. These and the rest of the \"Feedback Geometry\"  are  locked to the user's head, with a moderate lag, like the tunnel has   inertia.\r\n</li><li>Having one main \"Feedback Screen\" that also follows the user's head. This can either be a single plane with the feedback texture, or multiple planes tiled that have mirror images.</li><li>Having 3D Feedback Geometry that intersects with the  tunnel and forms  rings of abstract geometry, which are animated to move  and rotate  rhythmically. They intersect often, causing a kaleidoscope  feedback  effect.\r\n</li><li>Having a \"Base Visuals\" texture as a skybox,  which is ideally mostly  obscured at all times by the Feedback Geometry.  This will provide color  and shape information in the edges and gaps  around the 3D geometry while  allowing most of the visual field to form a  feedback loop with the  Feedback Texture. This can be static or  animated.\u00a0Even\u00a0a\u00a0solid\u00a0color can produce\u00a0very\u00a0cool\u00a0effects. \r\n</li><li>Adding a seamless and minimalist audio player, with  the ability to  create and load playlists in-app and provide unobtrusive  media controls  during a session.\r\n</li></ol>\n\n<p>In this second tech demo, you can see I've added post-processing on the video feedback so it inverts and hue shifts the feedback texture, like Fraksl. I've also replaced the ground and skybox with a solid pale blue color, like Fraksl, meaning all visuals are defined by geometry and head placement.\u00a0 I've also mirrored some cube walls, all of this results in some REALLY cool effects! I'm going to keep learning the basics of Unity and work on developing this idea further in my free time.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T11:57:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/782/78232b360861f4dab625c8506dc19eba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ella Jameson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
