If it were to be finished, it may or may not\u00a0include\u00a0Kirby. However,\u00a0I used him, Megaman, and Mario as placeholders so I didn't have to make sprites for them. The controls are WASD or the arrow keys to move, space to sprint, and shift to attack (though this is unfinished). I gave up on it and revisited it just now to turn it into a .exe game. I hope it's scary enough, though there is more Red Mist in this game than Kirby. There are 2 possible endings.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T19:18:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcdd46f43b84546f7ecf1ea02b9927b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Untrue Air"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
