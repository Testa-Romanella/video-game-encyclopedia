The longer you survive, the higher your score.<br/><br/>It is intended to be an aesthetic therapeutic experience, that entrances you and takes you on a beautiful dreamy journey through the shiny glittering parts of the cosmos. The retro space theme has been carefully chosen along with the sci-fi lo-fi music. You can almost meditate by playing the game.<br/><br/>Score points, unlock better spaceships and challenge your friends, to see if they can beat your high score.<br/><br/>Feel free to provide feedback and stay tuned. This is going to go big.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T12:21:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e3/9e3fbcd029c2a47fafe22afc67e09393.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HamzaMcKhan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
