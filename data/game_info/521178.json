It is inspired by popular platform games of the 90s.</p>\n<p>The original Flug games were built using The Games Factory by Clickteam, this new version was developed using Clickteam Fusion 2.5.</p>\n<p>I have attempted to recreate a Flug game for many years, having multiple engine tests dating back as far as 2008. So to finally have something ready to release is a big deal (for me least).</p>\n<p>I started working on this again in July 2020, having found some extra time thanks to the recent lockdowns. The biggest obstacle was perfectionism (and moreso constantly comparing my creation with other games I saw on Itch etc). Instead I embraced a simpler graphical style and accepted that the engine may not be <em>perfect</em>. This has taken some 10 years overcome.<br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>The evil Spudnick is once again invading Flug's home planet of Bugtonia. You play as Flug through various colourful stages and must defeat Spudnick at the end of each.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>The music was created by my brother dUb. So, it's nice to have all original music. He went for a fast tempo techno style which has added a new flavour to the game.<br/></p>\r\nHidden levels\r\n<p>Collecting all gems on each stage unlocks 2 hidden levels, which are recreations of old levels from Flug 1 and Flug TMS (both from 2004/05).</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-20T05:51:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e38/e3895b01cbb2030c3a8f685869ccdc28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Hoj"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
