Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink.<br />\nOnce the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface.<br />\nWhat they uncover is anything but routine.<br />\nLow, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurtled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante\u2019s inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels.<br />\nBut no Cocytans.<br />\nWho were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins, and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainty?  To return to Earth, they must dig for answers, both on the planet\u2019s surface and deep within themselves.<br />\nFrom the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown. And takes you with it.<br />\nNearly 200 locations and hundreds of puzzles<br />\nRobert Patrick of T2 as the voice of Boston Low<br />\nSpecial effects contributed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic<br />\nDialogue contributed by award-winning sci-fi writer Orson Scott Card<br />\nAlluring Wagnerian musical score sets the epic tone</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1995-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-09T12:26:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b73/b73a769a03f0f9eefe99bbdfeef71afa.jpg", "website": "http://www.lucasarts.com/", "rating": 3.9, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 70, "owned": 638, "beaten": 52, "toplay": 31, "dropped": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 61, "suggestions_count": 524, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 61, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["LucasArts Entertainment", "Lucasfilm"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Disney Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
