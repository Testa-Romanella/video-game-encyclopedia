Failure to stop them will result in an invasion. Our country is too weak to fight against such a nation. But we can fight against their drones! Use your big gun!</p>\n<p>The Golistans have many drones. The <strong>red</strong> ones are just basic drones.<strong> Green</strong> ones can hack your gun and gives you debuffs. The <strong>blue</strong> ones can steal intel twice as fast. And finally, the <strong>purple </strong>ones, they generate a shield which blocks all of your attacks, but because of that, they can't steal your intel. When the bars under the drones fill up, they will fly away along with a part of our intel, which is the grey bar at the top. If the grey bar becomes empty, the Golistans will have enough intel to launch an invasion.</p>\n<p>Your gun is our best weapon against these drones. It has many attacks. <strong>\"Bullet\"</strong> attack shoots a bullet, weak but fast. <strong>\"Bomb\"</strong> attack shoots out a bomb, stronger but can't hit drones at higher altitudes, harder to control and bounces the drones around. The final attack is the <strong>\"Zap\"</strong>, it shoots out a beam of lighting, stopping the drones from taking intel for a small amount of time, it does little damage and is very slow.</p>\n<p>Also, after each day, you can upgrade your gun!<br/></p>\n<p>That's it for your briefing. Good luck out there! You're our last hope.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<ul><li>Left/Right arrow keys: Rotate gun</li><li>Space: Shoot</li><li>Z/X: Change attack</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:55:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/652/652fe6d2d1f1fa6e78a9ce8cfd066a53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["mkhoi"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
