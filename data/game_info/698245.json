{"id": 698245, "slug": "imoronpa-tater-happy-havoc", "name": "Imoronpa: Tater Happy Havoc", "name_original": "Imoronpa: Tater Happy Havoc", "description": "<p><strong>You are Makoto Naegi</strong>, a totally unremarkable high school student obsessed with potatoes. However, your fellow students aren\u2019t so keen on those tasty spuds. Convince them by tossing taters into their mouths.</p>\n<p>This game is based on a dumb joke from the Game Grumps let\u2019s play of Danganronpa; something about tossing a potato into a student\u2019s mouth in between reading their dialogue. I thought it would be funny to make a simple tater-tossing game based on that idea, and it quickly ballooned into a massive project.</p>\n<p>Seven months and about one-hundred fifty cumulative hours later, I\u2019ve got something ready to release, Game Grumps are well into Danganronpa 2 already, and I\u2019m probably the only one who remembers the throwaway joke that started this whole thing. I\u2019m not sure if it was worth all the time and effort, but hopefully it\u2019ll make someone laugh, if only for the novelty of the thing.</p>\n<p>I know next to no Japanese, so my title \"Imoronpa\" may be a little off. As I understand it \"Danganronpa\" breaks down into two words: \"dangan\" meaning \"bullet\" and \"ronpa\" being a type of debate (sometimes translated as \"rebuttal\" or \"refute.\") I decided to replace the   word \"dangan\"\u00a0with a word for potato, to create something like \"Potato Rebuttal\" or \"Tater Debate.\" After a little research, \"imo\" seemed to fit well; I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a catch-all term for potatoes and a variety of spuds, and it has the same number of syllables, so the full title ends up having the same rhythm as the original game.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources and other accreditation:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Built in the Godot Engine</li><li>Character portraits from the Danganronpa Fandom wiki</li><li>All fonts from Google Fonts</li><li>Some sounds captured from Danganronpa V3</li><li>Other sounds from freesound.org under the CC0 license</li><li>Music captured from the in-game Danganronpa \"Sound Gallery\"</li><li>Trial Grounds model from Models Resource posted by Ziella<br/></li></ul>\n<p><strong>System Compatibility:</strong></p>\n<p>System requirements should be pretty low.
