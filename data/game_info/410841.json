{"id": 410841, "slug": "cursed-ducks", "name": "Cursed Ducks", "name_original": "Cursed Ducks", "description": "<p>You are slaves to the rubber duck industry. Trapped in the solitary basement known as \"Quality Assurance\", you watch your empty robot lives pass you by as faulty ducks flood into your workshop. But hey, at least you've got each other.<br/>The corporate rubber hammer demands fast results, but what exactly is wrong with these ducks? They may be frozen, cursed, infected by a lethal virus or maybe inhabited by a tiny slimy alien. With your trained robot eyes, the problem should be easy to identify. Luckily, you have the perfect equipment for ice-breaking, curse-lifting, virus-neutralizing and kindly-asking-slimy-aliens-to-move-out-of-rubber-ducks. But operating these sophisticated machines require expert skills. Ice-breaking requires impeccable precision. Curse-lifting demands flawless focus on rune-reproducing. Virus-neutralizing could not be done without quick reflexes and a keen visual sensor. And alien communication protocol is very strict on mimicking alien morse code perfectly.</p>\n<p>Don't let any faulty ducks be delivered if you don't want to be dismantled again (or potentially unleash a lethal virus or an ancient rubber duck curse into the world, but who cares).</p>\n\n\n<p>----------------------</p>\n\n<p>\u00c1frica Curiel G\u00e1lvez - Game Design and Producing\r\nErwin Van Hoof - Programming and Game Design\r\nEva Kaup - Art Direction and UI\r\nJan Gihr - Programming and Art\r\nJeanBaptisteShow - UI support\r\nJudith M\u00fchr - 3D Art\r\nMarie Rouzi\u00e9 - Game Design and UI\r\nMichael Diener - Art\r\nRazvan Cristea - Music and Audio Design\r\nThorsten Schmiedel - Programming</p>\n<p>Assets used:</p>\n<p>ThreeBox - Tiny Robots Pack</p>\n<p>Terra Nova Creations - Low Poly Megapack - Lite</p>\n<p>UI background - https://www.pngguru.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-nyyme/do...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T07:13:59", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ranack"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
