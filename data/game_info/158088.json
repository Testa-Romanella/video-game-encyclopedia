It took me one day to\r\n get the web-developer AI working, because I wanted them to move in a \r\ncertain direction while being on a specific sprite. But that didnt work \r\nout as intended, since they started to move through walls because the \r\npivot point of the sprite was on the top-left corner. So we added a Step\r\n counter to it, so that the web-developer actually waits until he is in \r\nthe middle of a sprite to move.\r\nBut as i said before it took me one day. In the meantime my Artist was almost done with all the graphics.\r\nOh and it took me another day to write the Bug/Tower AI.\r\nBut yeah, after both AIs were kind of finished, I started to write some wave-spawning mechanics. And worked more on the UI.\r\nSo yeah, after 4 days of work, here is what we did. I hope you like it :D </p>\n<p>(oh and if you want to get some money, press x. I forgot to remove it, it was just there for testing purposes.)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54a/54a9123f0cd651520b9509b4ba23fc0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MirroredFate"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
