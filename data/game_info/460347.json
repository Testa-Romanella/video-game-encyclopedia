Source code and a walk through of the code can all be found over on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Scoring in DragonTT is wonderfully rudimentary. You get points for each piece you drop (ranging from 2 to 5 points depending on the piece) and points for clearing a line (10 points per line). There is no bonus for dropping. No bonus for clearing multiple lines at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no ghosts to help guide you.</p>\n<p>There is no 'next piece' to let you prepare.</p>\n<p>There is just you and an infinite supply of Tetronimoes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-29T06:14:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0bc/0bcf62cb65d41b17228a2d1906b82c26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["ahnlak"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
