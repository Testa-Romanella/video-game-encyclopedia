It is a parody of a comedy sketch from the BBC's Peter Serafinowicz Show from 2007, the original sketch itself being a parody of popular Cillit Bang advertisements with Barry Scott. It is available for Windows PCs.</p>\n<p>Derek Baum (or maybe it's Bum), hater of dirty things and creator of the all-cleansing Kitchen Gun, locates an inescapable prison dimension called the Dirty Kitchen Zone, where everything is a mess, and ordinary kitchen objects savagely attack anyone who tries to clean them. Coming equipped with his own Kitchen Gun and Toilet Grenades to boot, can Derek find the source of the Dirty Kitchen Zone's evil power, put a stop to it, and finally show the world how wonderful his products really are?</p>\n<p>Dirtbane contains some material to which I am not the copyright owner, thus it is free to download, and always will be. Additional information on such material - as well as means to contact me in case of issues - can be found in the game's ending credits, or in the associated \"README.txt\" file!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-02T13:39:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ec/3ec5a4c55d49dbaab51f4ba9ade543b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 168, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheNightGourd"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
