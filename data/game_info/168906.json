I intented to add a shop system and more features, though, I believe you will understand why I didn't. I thought it was boring after the first hour and a half of developpment, so now everything explodes.<br/><br/>This is a silly game you can pass, I had a blast making it and I believe that sharing how stupid and funny this game is would be relevant. And so is the \"X &amp; Shit\" mentality.</p><p><strong>- Controls - </strong></p><p>Left Click - Shoot Fireball</p><p>WASD - Move</p><p>Shift - Run</p><p><strong>- Credits -</strong></p><p>Music:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d4/7d4072941382eff5935a4241d7734159.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xandersauce"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
