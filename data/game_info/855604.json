Stranded in an otherworldly cave with low gravity, you seek its exit.</p>\n\r\nExpected play time: 20 minutes\r\n\n<p>This version is still in its demo phase. A lot of functionalities would naturally be missing. So do take note of the following:</p>\n<ul><li>No audio whatsoever.</li><li>No saving or loading states.</li><li>No settings.</li><li>A lot of physics bugs.</li><li>Barebones graphics.</li><li><strong>Not as ragey as other rage games... yet.</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to view Springman\u00a0(demo)!\u00a0Please check out my other projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T15:09:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba4/ba4d214c4dc7ce3b24c0c3ca73b62412.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["reen"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
