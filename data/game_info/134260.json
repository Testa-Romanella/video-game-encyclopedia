The inspiration for this game came from the free 3D models by Kenney as well as my own previous snowball fighting game. This prototype/demo is free to download and play, so enjoy!</p>\n<p><em>Programmed to work with XBox 360 controllers (two to four local players).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Known bug:</strong> When controllers are turned on or plugged in before the game is running, the triggers are not assigned to the proper controller number. If this happens, return to the title screen of the game and disconnect all controllers and then reconnect all controllers. This appears to be a bug with Unity Game Engine. If anyone knows a fix, please let me know.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39f24d7df468f0fcfe800ea2acd8efba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LastHorizonGames"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
