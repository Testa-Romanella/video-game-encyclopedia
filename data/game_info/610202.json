These weapons are quite deadly and follow the rules of physics. You also have access to a drone which can be used to plan out your attacks so that you can stay safe. Additional abilities can be used to aid you in combat. Enemies will continously spawn in which is how you will restock on your firearms. The main focus of the game is killing as many enemies as you can before being killed.<br/></p>\n<p>Scout is a game that I have developed for my final major project at college which is heavily inspired by the Watch Dogs series. It consists of 7 main mechanics which are:<br/></p>\n<p>Movement, Drone, Transitions, Weapons, Enemies, Environment, Abilities<br/></p>\n<p>My specialism is programming which meant I went into great depth to ensure each mechanic was full of details and really pushed my skills to the max. I began this project by doing an extensive amount of research and planning to fully prepare for the development. The work itself came to life by starting with  prototyping then working up to the planned outcome, building up each main mechanic then expanding on them once the foundations were built.<br/></p>\n<p>Overall, I feel like I've accomplished a lot in this project. Compared to my old projects, I've learnt so much more about programming like inheritance, abstraction, utilizing different return types and getting much better at coming up with solutions to problems, often having an idea about the solution before getting to the actual coding. I've also improved heavily on my documentation and approach to work since I prepared very well and this led me to finishing the project ahead of the deadline.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This project concluded my two years of studying Level 3 Games Development at college. I believe my skills have built up really well over this time and this has given me a great insight into developing games at every level as I've done some design work, some art work and a heavy amount of programming. I feel very proud of the outcome I was able to create as it is a nice way to finish off this course and it shows off my skillset and experience very well.<br/></p>\n\n<p>Stats:</p>\n<p>Lines of code:<br/>How enjoyable was development of this project: 9/10<br/>How much I learnt throughout this project: 8/10<br/>Difficulty of this project: 6/10<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T11:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/217/21741c22197b7db86d535e99ba270f46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["0xDaniooo"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
