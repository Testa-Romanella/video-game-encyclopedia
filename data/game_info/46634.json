This will allow you to focus on piloting your Core to be mobile and reactive, so that at every moment you will be able to flee or run after your opponents. You will also have to be careful of your shooting accuracy to eject and destroy your enemies.<br />\nMoreover, thanks to our customization options, you will be able to control a teapot or a light bulb, as well as a skull or a pig. Your Core\u2019s armor and its lights are also customizable.Game modesThe Team\u200b \u200bmode\u200b (3v3 maximum). A game lasts 5 minutes and the team who ejects the highest number of enemies wins.<br />\nThe Juggernaut\u200b \u200bmode\u200b, in which one player is alone against the world! A game lasts 3 minutes, and the Juggernaut has to survive during the whole time to win. His opponents have to eject him 3 times to be victorious. And of course, the Juggernaut is bigger and stronger than them!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-04T21:29:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4f/c4f0e811dfe596a2984d8e86c7789f49.jpg", "website": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210615170822/https://cosmicray-studio.com/projects.html", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 20, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 23, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cosmic Ray Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cosmic Ray Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
