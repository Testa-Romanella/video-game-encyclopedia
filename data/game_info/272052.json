Use Up arrow to  accelerate. The Space bar activates your syringe to inject juice into butts as they float around. For a short window after you have injected a but your syringe can spin around very fast. This lets you whip the syringe around and get a few butts in one sweep of the needle!<br/></p>\n<p>When the juice meter is empty you can't inject butts any more. Pick up a medicine bottle to get more juice!</p>\n<p>Every round your muscle meter (in the top left corner) will get thicker. Play to the end to see some massive flexing muscles!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Fancy Pants</strong><br/>The game supports gamepads but the control panel for them may be cut off on here.</p><p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>michaelfiber - programming<br/>UMKShock - graphics<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:19:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9a/d9ab3c998f35bae9f8d232d6227cc5d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["michaelfiber"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
