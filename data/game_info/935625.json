Much more content will be added over time.\r\n</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>You arrive at the office on the 15th floor to do your daily routines at work. At some point during the process, your vision gets blurry and you suddenly faint. When you wake up, it is nighttime. It\u2019s dark and the office seems abandoned.\r\n</p>\n<p>You begin your search at the office, but unfortunately you are not able to find a living soul. You notice the phone lines are dead and the light switches don\u2019t work either. There's no power. Luckily you managed to find a flashlight in a drawer. You notice that one of the elevators is still working. You enter the elevator and decide to go home.\r\n</p>\n<p>Your car is parked down in the basement\u2026</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n\r\n<p>Like any other shooter, you need to find guns and ammo to kill the enemy in order to survive.\r\n</p>\n<p>As you progress you will find some interesting objects. Some objects are collectable and some are usable.\r\n</p>\n<p>The flashlight has an unlimited battery.\r\n</p>\r\nThe inventory\r\n<p>The items that you collect end up in your inventory. The inventory automatically opens if you\u2019ve interacted with an object that needs an item.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\nGame in development\r\n<p>This is a solo project, so if you are expecting AAA game standards, this is not the game for you.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Even though this is a prototype, the game is still completable.\u00a0 However, you may come across some unfinished elements, such as unnecessary items, missing assets or incomplete objectives.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game style is a bit like Left4Dead, Resident Evil &amp; Dying Light.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>The full game will contain more areas like a substation, city streets, etc.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>For the time being, the game is only available for Windows.\r\n</p>\n<p>Any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome.</p>\r\nOther Games\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact and follow Information:\r\n<p>Email:\u00a0acesgamedevelopment@gmail.com\r\n</p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/YEeKJ7H\r\n</p>\n<p>Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/aces_games</p>\n<p>Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/acesgamesdk/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T16:15:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b84/b8414bfe46fff1ab21e9ab8900227251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aces Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
