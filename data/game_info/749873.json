This is the way of the Fisherman. The Fisherfolk on the other hand laughs at these patient fools, electing instead to cast their rod, catch a fish immediately, and tire the fish out by forcing it to dance to a sick beat. You are a Fisherfolk, lured to a quiet pond near the mountains by the promise of rare and mythical fish, although you feel that your fishing dancing skills will need to be on point to reel them in.</p>\n<p><strong>By:\u00a0</strong>William Graham, Scott Chapman, and Antonio Mastroguiseppe<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<p>Pond_Ambience_shortend.wav by CUeckermann at https://freesound.org/people/CUeckermann/sounds/444835/ under (CC BY 3.0) It has been altered to shorten its length</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-04T10:00:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f3/3f3acaf61ed5081d31c11854be870176.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["williamdual", "kijaro", "Pufblon"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
