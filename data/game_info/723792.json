This game was refreshed and rolled into the newer\u00a0<em>Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle, Season One</em> release in 2021, which can be found here.</p>\n<p>We're keeping this page here for posterity, as a fun reminder of where the game started. The original description follows.</p>\n<p>======</p>\r\nBattle for justice\u00a0in an anime-themed world\u00a0as Nina Aquila, defence attorney and bona fide Legal Eagle!\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nina\u00a0Aquila: Legal Eagle</em><strong>\u00a0is an anime-themed VN/graphic adventure game, in which you step into the shoes\u00a0of a rookie\u00a0defense attorney.\u00a0Fledge City is in crisis, and it's up to Nina Aquila and her friends to make sure justice prevails!</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li><strong>A fully-SFW graphic adventure</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Take the role of a new defence attorney</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Get to know a cast of quirky characters</strong>\n</li><li><strong>Defend your client in court!</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>With a tone that mixes crime with\u00a0a light-hearted feel, a cast of quirky characters and a compelling story,\u00a0<em>NALE</em>\u00a0is intended as a\u00a0homage to the Phoenix Wright franchise, but should appeal to all fans of anime &amp; graphic adventures.\r\n</p>\r\nThis first case is ~1 hour in duration.\r\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Chapter 1:\u00a0First Flight\r\n</p>\r\nIn each chapter, Nina takes on the case of a client who has been charged with a major crime, who she believes to be innocent. To prove this, she and her friends\u00a0journey to different areas around Fledge City, gathering evidence, before going to court to fight for her client's cause.\r\nFreshly qualified as a defence attorney, Nina's first few cases go well...\u00a0But when her mentor is imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit, her career becomes a casualty of a secret war... A war that, unknown to Nina, is connected to her own past.\r\nA great game is being played for the heart of the city by the ruthless and powerful,\u00a0but right now, Nina doesn't even know who is playing, much less the rules. She will need to trust her friends and forge new alliances if she is to fight for justice and\u00a0uncover the truth.\r\nContent/Trigger Warnings\r\n<p>NALE Chapter 1 should not present any major trigger or content issues for most adults. However, the story touches upon a disaster involving a fire at a campground, and may distress those who have particular aversion to themes of fire-related injury.\r\n</p>\r\nAccessibility Info\r\n<p>NALE has a number of accessibility considerations, which\u00a0<em>may</em>\u00a0make the game more comfortable for some players. These options include reducing flashes and bright, intense onscreen effects. A full rundown of NALE's accessibility options can be found\u00a0HERE.\r\n</p>\r\nCurrent state of the project\r\n<p>NALE is created on a chapter-by-chapter basis.\r\n</p>\n<p>Chapters 1-3 are now available in a collected release called\u00a0<strong>Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle, Season One</strong>, available both\u00a0here on itch\u00a0and\u00a0over on\u00a0Steam.\r\n</p>\n<p>Updates &amp; news are posted here on itchio, but we strongly recommend fans join our discord:\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits &amp; Special Thanks\r\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This game was made by Tanuki-sama Studios:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>https://twitter.com/NinaAquilaGame\r\n</li><li>http://www.tanukisama.com\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks go to the RPG Maker official forums &amp; subreddit, all of our followers on Twitter &amp; Tumblr, and members of our Discord community.\r\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, this game has a wide range of asset &amp; plugin credits.
