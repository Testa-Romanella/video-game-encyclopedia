Matches are fast and hectic, but the controls are simple and responsive, making it easy to introduce to your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMaster powerful relics to give you the strategic advantage. Each grants you a new and useful skill, but you can't have more than one at a time so choose wisely!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuel with up to 4 friends, or against AI bots, either in a free for all frenzy or in teams. The teams in Dueledged are broken up by faction, competing groups from within the world of the Archipelago.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as a commando in the Army, outfitted with all the best tactical gear and an action hero styled attitude. Or side with the Church, and play as a Demonhunter, tasked with the duty of protecting the Archipelago from supernatural threats. Even play as a Demon yourself, and reclaim your ancestral homeland from the greedy monkeys and humans. Better yet, choose to play as a Mercenary, and align yourself with any of the other factions.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuel across 10 different locations in the Archipelago, the tropical fantasy world that Dueledged takes place in.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCustomize your champion to your heart's content, with 100+ unlockable cosmetic items, and 1000s of combinations.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-06T06:38:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4de/4deccf53e85a5eaf6722eef5efd29549.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tired Monkey Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Tired Monkey Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
