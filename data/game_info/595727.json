As long as they can eat, sleep and have a pint, of course. They dig, they build required stuff, dig deeper, build more, deeper, deeper and deeper.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been a bumpy road and we had to cut a lot of features but we found a version with a taste of our grand vision.\r\n</p>\n<p>Gameplay is simple: You give a command to dwarves and one of them will pick up and take care of it. As you need energy and get more dwarves, you always need to keep digging deeper and deeper.\r\n</p>\n<p>Make sure to build one of each building early on to ensure your dwarves have a place to eat and sleep and have fun\u2026 and convert ore into energy.\r\n</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy the game!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Source Code\u00a0https://github.com/themaelstorm/LD2021</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T15:14:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/402/402f8670f36898588e742a0a522f9e53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Emirhan Bayyurt"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
