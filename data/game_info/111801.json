A game made out of words and choices.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You mean it's Interactive Fiction?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Not quite. IF tends to be very story-focused, with choices that move the player down some branch of the\u00a0story-arc. Path of Adventure is very <strong>gameplay-focused</strong>. It's a world\u00a0in\u00a0which you control a character,\u00a0creating your own story along the way.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Like those old text-adventures?</em><br/></strong></p>\n<p>Not really. Those games are very puzzle-based, with a number of pre-defined solutions.\u00a0Path of Adventure is <strong>full of surprises</strong> and requires tactics and strategy to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>So how does it\u00a0play?</em></strong></p>\n<p>It plays a lot like a\u00a0<strong>Roguelike</strong> with turn-based action. It\u00a0centers around battling monsters, exploring dungeons and going on quests.\u00a0\u00a0You'll find items and weapons and use them effectively.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Then why text?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Because text is awesome! It\u00a0triggers the imagination which is super powerful. And also\u00a0because I'm making this game by my own and I'm a terrible artist ;)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T01:53:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d6/3d6546f054eb03fef01a465bc85db56b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Keeweed", "Jordin Kee"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Jordin Kee"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
