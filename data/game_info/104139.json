As a result, the ambition to create this game was born. Made in about 5 hours, this is the end result: a small game where you launch a ragdoll body down a path and try to hit as many mines to boost your distance as far as possible. Mine's are spawned randomly, so luck will play a large role in the total distance you can achieve.</p><p>Controls are quite simple - launch with space bar or the primary mouse button and reset the ragdoll with 'R'.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f3/7f319ec4b42bac6d1ab9eabe084f83b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Besus"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
