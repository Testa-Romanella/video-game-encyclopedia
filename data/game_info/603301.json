There is still much more left, once I patch up Unknown Origins I will officially get into my newest project and export the last one so far that's still currently in development! It is part of a different series and it tells a bit about K's story. I've still got a lot of work to do and the thing is, the audio might be a problem for all of the projects including this one because I'd have to do twice the work I plan to right now! So as of the fate of the audio for all of these (except for the newest project) I am not sure as to keep it or not.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T08:32:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64d/64d27ff74d4fd668baf989089f477665.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knight"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
