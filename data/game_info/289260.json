Player controls the lift of a 7-story building, the goal is to deliver all the residents to their destination as high-efficient as possible. NPCs will have patience\u00a0 counting-down timer/\u00a0floor requirement icon appear on their heads. If they ran out of patience, player loses score, Conversely, if player secured NPCs by letting them entered the lift carriage and successfully delivered them to the applicable floors, player get scores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This build has not met the expected level of\u00a0completion stated in the design document. Specifically,  the differentiation of NPCs in attributes,\u00a0\u00a0abilities and behavior has not been added yet. So it might not going to get a green light for commercialization.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But I still want to get some feedback and thoughts about this project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So please, play the current build and strike me with ideas, PLEASE.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-01T03:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e66/e66d692a46c87ceaf1f641a0e287dd31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Alex He"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
