Solve interactive puzzles and avoid getting your feline companion caught in a myriad of traps while leading them to freedom. This game requires a VR headset, so please consider this requirement before buying. Feel free to join us on our Discord server and become part of our community.<h3>The Story</h3><br/>Don't. Kill. The. Cat. You avoid doing it every day, Employee 42, well, as far as we can tell and from what I can see in your personnel file from HR. The Argento Company cannot afford another PR disaster after our last run in with the Gelatinous Blob experiment. Who knew a cleaning agent designed to be self-aware would go all monster manual on us? We can't innovate without taking risks!<br/><br/>We need you to guide the cat out of the building using our industrial grade (*not for military application in all 50 US states including Puerto Rico and other territories) \"laser pointer\" while avoiding any mishaps. Your job is on the line. Don't mess this up.<h3>The Features</h3><br/>Using your industrial grade \"laser pointer,\" you will lead a cat of your choice through puzzles by collecting key cards at various clearance levels and avoiding an assortment of traps. Some puzzles require you to use switches, dials, and levers while others are all about avoiding falling objects, chemical spills, and failed experiments that love the taste of cat. Many of the objects in the world are interactable and destructible giving you the ability to solve puzzles in different ways.<br/><br/>Customize your cat using accessories and objects you will find hidden around the game. This includes everything from hats to outfits to collars to make the cat your own. Turn your cat into your favorite meme with some of our easter egg accessories.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T04:14:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/881e05c9c8c586b22ce447613d3fcaae.jpg", "website": "https://silversundynamics.com/dktc", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver Sun Dynamics"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Silver Sun Dynamics"], "esrb_rating": null}
