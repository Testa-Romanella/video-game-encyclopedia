Use what you know about physics to find a way how to maneuver it nevertheless and survive in the asteroid belt as long as you can.</p><p>As you do you may have to choose between shooting the enemies and retaining control over your spaceship. Shoot too much and you will go too fast and won't be able to navigate precisely and much less to aim precisely. However if you don't shoot enough your vicinity will fill with enemies threatening to take down your spacecraft once and for all.</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>The assets such as the ingame sprites and the explosion prefabs are from the free assets provided for the\u00a0Player26 Quark tutorial.\u00a0 Sounds can be found on\u00a0https://freesound.org/\u00a0and are licensed under the creative common license.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c0/7c0d14bbe5ec054fe47c8e20d3da4615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drakon94"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
