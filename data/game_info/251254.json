It isn't until against his will, his parents force him from his home to take on the role of a shrine tender for a far away place deep in the depths of an Asian shrine. Turns out his grandparents have given over their passed down traditions, even though Hurato isn't happy about it at all. Being forced into a creepy shrine, he finds there's more to this 'shrine tending' then he was let on. He's got a fox and a planed destiny just for him...</p>\n<p>Note(:Please excuse anything missing as of now! This is completely for fun and I'm doing this in my free time with using bear minimum with no money spent. So if you want something fun to read, by all means just wait for the next update.\u00a0</p><p>*Have added some sprites to fill in for side characters.\u00a0Figure it would be better than looking at nothing. :')</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2cb/2cbf9175d6f4e5086e0802f0e6e82aee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MooMootalian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
