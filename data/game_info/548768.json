Or been confronted by a player asking 'what's the book about' and had no idea?</p>\n<p>This versatile generator is designed to help with that and other questions. Use it to generate unique magic items with interesting story hooks, or for evocative ordinary objects with stories to them. Coins, books, and more! There's thousands of different combinations, for all your needs.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This generator released as PWYW, however, do please consider donating\u00a0either here or on ko-fi if you enjoy this generator, or tell your friends about it. Also, follow me on twitter or tumblr for updates on this and other generators (I have big plans afoot), as well as art, art process/tutorial videos, RPG content, and much more.</p>\n<p>Find out more about me and the generator in the about page within. I'd love to hear about what you create!<br/></p>\n<p>(This game released as downloadables because I am experimenting with what format is best; let me know if you have an opinion!)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-29T07:00:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b1144757e0f6d65764b579344dd4664.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kes Beacon"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
