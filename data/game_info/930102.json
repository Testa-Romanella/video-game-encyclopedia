You can also switch between tile types by using the button on the bottom-left side of the screen. Place walls to block the path or glue, which takes twice as long to traverse as empty tiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After placing down some tiles press the start button to start the simulation. While a simulation is running\u00a0 you can't edit the grid, but\u00a0you can pause the simulation and edit the grid again using the pause button and after unpausing again, a new path gets calcult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press the reset button\u00a0to reset the actor's position or press the clear button to clear the board of any tiles you placed down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>By enabling or disabling the checkboxes on the top-left of the screen, you can also change the amount of information shown to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\r\nW, A, S, DRotate the cameraScroll wheelZoom in/outQSwitch between tile typesEClear the board of any placed down tilesRReset the actor's positionHHide GUI\r\n\n<p><strong>Distances Explanation</strong></p>\n<p>f ... sum of g and h</p>\n<p>g ... distance to start</p>\n<p>h ... distance to target</p>\n<p>The font color of the tiles ,that have been visited while calculating the path , is set to black and the font color of the tiles, that only have been looked at by the algorithm\u00a0but not visited, is set to grey.
