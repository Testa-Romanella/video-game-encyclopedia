As the 2020 U.S. presidential election draws nearer and nearer, Tommy has found it increasingly urgent for everyone\u2014campaign organizers and everyday voters alike\u2014to rethink the ways in which candidates communicate their presidential style and identity. In an attempt to tackle the large issue of political disengagement and promote a reassessment of politics through a Communication Studies lens, Tommy has created an online game that allows users to connect with the 2020 election through presidential campaign music. This game, titled \u201c2020 Tune-In,\u201d invites users to select songs they enjoy and, from there, receive results that match them to the presidential campaign playlist that most closely aligns with their music preferences.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T03:22:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e0/7e0e2d22a9e1d406837de5e2d2318885.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tommy_oswalt"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
