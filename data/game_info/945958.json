The goal is to visit as many planets as possible while surviving for as many days as possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>Completing missions earns you credits that you can spend on refilling fuel and oxygen or buying upgrades. Use the radar in the upper right corner to navigate each planet. To leave a planet, you must wait a full day, and you will receive a notification. Use your time wisely to ensure you've completed everything before departing.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T12:44:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b1/6b195e8d3a8ac2afa94aae8b9fb350b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nannings", "FromHome-Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
