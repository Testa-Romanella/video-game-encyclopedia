You are a refugee, building your own world away \r\nfrom the spreading darkness. You are an explorer, discovering new \r\nplaces, new rules, and new fascinations. The universe is bigger than you\r\n know.<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>I really don't like describing Starseed Pilgrim! But if I don't, I'm pretty much asking you to buy it based on... images, and that's worse. It's a game about discovery and learning, and eventually about mastery of a strange set of tools. It's been said, and echoed, that it's a game you have to experience for yourself.<br/><br/>I guess I believe that. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb5/fb54ef64dddc9cde4a65b2e9a852e73f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Droqen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
