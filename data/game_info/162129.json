This was created based on Ben Tristem's original Unity course on Udemy.\u00a0 Two modes of play are offered, \"1980's\" mode, a casual, almost laid-back playstyle would fit this mode best. Then there's \"insane\" mode, because: reasons.\u00a0<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the slow start to insane mode. Clear the first dozen waves of enemies and take note: your battle has only just begun. Soon, you'll be crying to go back to the good ol' days when the screen wasn't filled with a near continuous rain of enemy fire.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/81f/81fe891450735a9ab1913981019da9fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jack Draak"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
