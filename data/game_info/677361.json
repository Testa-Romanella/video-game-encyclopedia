As the beautiful, blossoming explosion in the sky unveiled that its charm was actually maleficent - in her eyes -, Sanae sets out to investigate what sort of unknown fragments were those that scattered around Gensokyo. Guided by Kanako and Suwako, she seeks those who have been in contact with this miraculous jewel to try and retrieve those curious artifacts, while also trying to identify who could possibly be the perpetrator of this newborn incident.\r\n </p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to her, other people were also trying to take advantage of these strange powers contained inside the fragments. What would it be of Gensokyo if this chaos isn't contained in time?
