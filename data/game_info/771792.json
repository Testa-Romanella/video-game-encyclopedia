There arent many games for the series out there so I\u00a0figured I'd start making some using this easy to use engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is simple, its just astroid, point and shoot. use WASD controls to move. not much else to it. though it is hard because of the limited size and space, so later levels will get harder because of it. I might improve on it by making it bigger when I figure how and improve on the sprites. but for now enjoy.</p>\n<p>The assets of sounds I used are from halo, mlaatr theme song and also just random explosion sound I found on youtube, but I did the in game drawing assets myself. The main menu I found online.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forgive me for how bad the game looks and is running.\u00a0Im new to making games and this is one of my first steps into developing them. Enjoy :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:24:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9c/d9c1b55c4f3ec23bec1e63bf98f2ff58.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RavenBoy99"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
