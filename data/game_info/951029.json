{"id": 951029, "slug": "bill-clinton-game-of-the-year-edition", "name": "Bill Clinton: Game of the Year Edition", "name_original": "Bill Clinton: Game of the Year Edition", "description": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Contains Jumpscares!</strong><br/></p>\n<p>A silly April Fools game revolving around former U.S. president Bill Clinton. The reason? Simply inspired by that dude that nominated \"Bill Clinton\" for Game of the Year at the Game Awards.</p>\n<p>This game is designed as a point-and-click horror survival that, due to the event it was made for, is not actually taken overly seriously. Therefore, it is also advised that you as a possible player should not take it seriously. Avoid being that stereotypical Twitter user that would assume we're trying to say political stuff through this game by NOT doing that.</p>\n<p>The game currently features two levels due to that being all that could be done by the deadline. However, further casual updates in the future are being considered. So if you are interested in knowing when those happen, be sure to keep an eye out.</p>\n<p>The only tools you have to use are your mouse and your space bar. For the most part you just point and click, however there is currently one section where the space bar is required.</p>\n<p>If you wish to play the game in full-blown fullscreen beyond just maximizing the window, press Alt + Enter while the window is selected. The game is intended to be played this way.</p>\n<p>Are you stuck on a part that is too difficult or unclear in instructions? While this is the point of the game and the intended way to play is without instructions, we don't want you getting frustrated forever. Therefore we are willing to provide you with a few steps if you're finding yourself dead over and over.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nRevolver Level Guide\r\n<p>The following is a step-by-step guide to getting past the Revolver Level. If you are finding yourself stuck because a part is too difficult or unclear, this should hopefully help you.</p>\n<ol><li>Click the revolver. It should slide to the middle of the desk.</li><li>Click the small black button. This will open the revolver.</li><li>Click a bullet to pick it up. Please note you\u00a0<strong>do not\u00a0</strong>have to hold the mouse down to drag it to the gun.</li><li>In order to progress, you must successfully load three bullets. This is the most difficult part of the level, as bumping the bullet will cause you to lose your grip. In order to load the bullet successfully, you must\u00a0<strong>thread the needle to avoid hitting the sides of the chamber.\u00a0</strong>Taking this part slowly is advised.</li><li>Once three bullets have been loaded, you must click on the chambers to close them back up.</li><li>Click on the revolver's hammer. Once you have done this, the level is done and anything further is merely cinematic.</li></ol>\r\nArtillery Level Guide\r\n<p>The following is a step-by-step guide to getting past the Artillery Level. If you are finding yourself stuck because a part is too difficult or unclear, this should hopefully help you.</p>\n<ol><li>Click the artillery shell next to you. You will pick it up.</li><li>Soon after doing this, the game will very quickly initiate a\u00a0<strong>quick-time event.\u00a0</strong>You must\u00a0<strong>mash your space bar\u00a0</strong>repeatedly in order to carry the shell properly, otherwise you risk dropping it. Here's a tip: While surviving this part is difficult to do with a single hand,\u00a0<strong>using both hand on your space bar\u00a0</strong>can create a rhythm that will very easily get you past this point.</li><li>The camera will change angles once the quick-time event is over. The first thing to do after this occurs is to click the artillery shell yet again to load it.</li><li>Click the latch to the artillery cannon's barrel to lock it.</li><li>Click the cannon's aiming wheel to adjust the cannon's aim.</li><li>Click the cannon's trigger on top of it. Once you have done this, the level is done and anything further is merely cinematic.</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T18:36:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8d2/8d2c5fb89e6ab705804832998edeaaf5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Master Key Gamez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
