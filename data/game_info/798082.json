Which one will you get?!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>F - Feed</p>\n<p>C - Clean</p>\n<p>Tab - View Menu</p>\n<p>Mouse Wheel - Zoom in and out</p>\n<p>Made for the Go Godot Jam 3. it was my first jam and wish I had a proper amount of time to work on it. Though somehow I still scraped a few hours to at least put this together. There were some things I\u00a0really wanted to do but just lacked the time for such as allowing actually pressing the buttons on the device and having the food determine the evolution tree. But ended up just relying on randomization. If there is some want for updates to the project I'll try to continue work on\u00a0it since it does lack as far as gameplay goes. But otherwise, let me know what you all think!<br/></p>\n<p>For this desktop version of the game, there is twitch integration to allow 2 simple commands which are !feed and !clean. Can also be green chroma keyed to remove the background for adding it as a stream element.<br/><br/>If you need any help feel free to reach me on discord!</p>\n<p>-one love</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T05:51:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e9/0e9b26f13a1c626b04a1f8c9abef55f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["adocii"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
