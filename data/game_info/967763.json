But as you defeat them, something strange happens: you get teleported to another universe, where a new set of challenges awaits you. Can you survive and conquer them all?<br/><br/>Each world you visit is unique and filled with different enemies, so you'll need to adapt your strategy and skills to succeed. Luckily, you'll also have the chance to collect powerful artifacts that can boost your abilities and make you even stronger. Choose wisely, as your choices may determine if you live or die.<br/><br/>But the greatest challenge of all awaits you at the end of your journey, where you will face an adversary like no other. A being that has also endured the Infinity Trials maybe longer than any other.<h3>Ultra fast precision combat</h3>One hit kills enemies and one hit kills you. The fast paced combat requires you to move quickly and kill quickly as the faster you kill the more gems you earn. The gems are used for powerful artifacts from various universes which will help you kill faster and earn more gems to buy more Artifacts. The Artifacts will quickly make you into a instant killing machine where dozens of enemies will perish with each swing of a sword or arrow from the bow. While speed is of the essence, so is grace and accuracy. A swing and a miss will make very exposed to enemy hits.<h3>Challenge others</h3>Claim your place on the leaderboards! Only a perfect run will yield the perfect score!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-16T02:35:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea5d1d69b14b62712e9ecac1ccce79f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Olle Wahlstr\u00f6m"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Olle Wahlstr\u00f6m"], "esrb_rating": null}
