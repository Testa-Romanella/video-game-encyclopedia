It was a little overwhelming and the game may be a little rough on some places, but we are proud to have participated in the Kenney Jam 2019!</p>\n<p>Your objective is to get to the end goal (reach area 51) while refueling the\u00a0cars so they never run out of fuel and to get rid of\u00a0the aliens with the help of your trusty gasoline-shooting gun.<br/></p>\n<p>This game fits the them of the Kenney Jam (Unlikely Combinations) because this game is a mix of platformer (jump on the cars), resource management (micromanaging the fuel) and\u00a0action (shooting the aliens) . Also, because there are aliens in the desert with a touch of JoJo's and pixel art.</p>\n<p>This game was made by a team of 5 for the Kenney Jam 2019.</p>\n<p>Assets used in this game (all Kenney\u00a0assets):</p>\n<ol><li>Pixel vehicle pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-vehicle-pack</li><li>Background elements pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/background-elements</li><li>Background elements redux pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/background-elements-redux</li><li>Particle pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack</li><li>Alien UFO pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/alien-ufo-pack</li><li>Kenney Fonts pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts</li><li>On-Screen Controls pack\u00a0https://kenney.nl/assets/onscreen-controls</li></ol>\n\n<p>The controls are the following:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD to move</li><li>Left click to shoot</li><li>E to interact (to refilll cars' fuel)</li><li>Acces the pause menu on the superior right corner</li></ul>\n\n<p>Help the raiders of Area 51 achieve their destiny!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa7/fa7bac2e2c523414525bc6c88a49ea08.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ariel Martinez"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
