Paperboy Droid is a remake of Paperboy by Tiger Electronics. This is the first game my dad gave me when I was little. I completely changed the mechanics of the game: you have to program a droid that will play for you by performing the actions of your program. I created the\u00a0game alone during the game jam\u00a0weekend, without using prefabricated elements.</p>\n<p>You can download the game for Windows, Mac, Linux or play in your browser. The game is played only with the mouse.
