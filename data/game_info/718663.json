Collect the items in the treasure chests for your vault. Use items in your vault, characters, and assorted stuff you find to compose pictures in different parts of the world. You can move, rotate, and resize objects, and arrange lighting however you want. When you take a picture with your camera of your composition, it magically appears hanging in your gallery. The pictures get saved to your computer if you later want to share them with friends. (See the ReadMe file for location of your saved picture files.) Dream on all you artists out there! (Sorry Windows only) Note if lights aren't lighting properly, try right clicking them to change color and go from there. A little bug. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-07T05:53:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/558/5584015ebb7a4b79ead48d139a0c168f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ShivaFooL"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
