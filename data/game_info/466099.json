Our protagonist is a worm but not just a worm he has mind control abilities and thanks this abilities he can manipulate humans. <strong>Against he, humans are losing their controls</strong>.<strong> But also our abilities are\u00a0getting weaker and in the game time by time you are controlling or you are be controlled.</strong></p>\n\r\nHOW TO PLAY!!!\r\n<p>\u00a0-Aim humans and press left click\u00a0to obtain them.</p>\n<p>-You can control humans by a,s,d but it is collapseing\u00a0your stamina.</p>\n<p>-Stamina bar is on the center.</p>\n<p>-And you can pass one human to other BUT if you do that two or more times you lose your control on human.</p>\n<p><strong>-AND PLEASE READ TEXTS IN THE GAME</strong></p>\n\n<p>My games theme all about losing control and gaining that. For example humans lose their controls against player(aka. Worm) and of course player lose their abilities time by time. All that circulation builds my game.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for all bad animations and less content but two days are not enough for me. I really entertain in that time. Yes I know game has a lot of bug.</p>\n<p><strong>-You cant exit the game you need to do force quit.</strong></p>\n<p>-Cursor is visible</p>\n<p>Yeah I did not solve this problem because my time was out.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T11:21:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/655/655b0723e9bf792a8b8267053215320b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mustafa Ozdemir"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
