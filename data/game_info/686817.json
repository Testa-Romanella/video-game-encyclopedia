Congratulations! You shot it.<br/><br/>You will experience various conflict areas and scenarios, such as the hostage crisis in front of a bank raided by robbers, the capture of a military base by militants.<br/><br/>Sometimes it will be enough to just hit the target they are standing in front of, not the enemy soldiers. Just shoot the target highlighted in red such as choppers, vehicles, ammunition depots or gas tankers.<br/><br/>As you level up, you can get new and more powerful weapons and jump in rank. However, you need to be careful that as you progress, the stable targets will become mobile and it will be difficult for you to aim. You have to neutralize the enemy soldiers before they shoot you.<br/><br/>You can get extra points for each enemy you shoot in the head. You will also earn extra points as you shoot the targets marked with green next to the enemy targets. But there is a dilemma, you should first shoot the prize to get it, not the enemy soldier. Which one will you shoot first? As soon as you hit the prize, the enemy soldier notices you and starts shooting at you.<br/><br/>Enemy soldiers will sometimes be wearing armoured helmets and vests, which will force you quite hard. So you shouldn't miss and waste your bullets. If you are careful, you can find small but pretty effective methods and pitfalls to kill them all.<br/><br/>Enjoy Sniper Attack 3D committed to the action!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T02:26:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efd/efd99211a32297d069b740d8cf78ffbd_Fl9oJHp.jpg", "website": "https://sniperattack.matchingham.gs", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 375, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["MATCHINGHAM GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["MATCHINGHAM GAMES"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
