{"id": 179932, "slug": "space-junk-2", "name": "Space Junk!", "name_original": "Space Junk!", "description": "<p>Pioneering space travel took amazing teamwork, brilliant minds, precision engineering, and a buncha science. Now you can do the same thing, but with a buddy and a bunch of junk you found on the ground! Also, you\u2019re raccoons. Turns out, the real space odyssey was the friendships we made along the way, and all this random trash we cobbled into a spaceship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chill, casual 2 player couch co-op about fun, friendship, and garbage. Scavenge for trash treasure and build a spaceship, then blast off and and co-pilot your beautiful junk masterpiece while fending off space hazards by pelting them with rubbish. We are all trash held together by friendship.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br/>Hook up one or a couple XBOX or PS4 controllers to your computer</p>\n<p>Stage 1 - Use joystick + A/square to move and pick up/drop trash. Drop all trash into the drop zone to complete your ship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heads up if you\u2019re playing co-op! If one player hits A/square, it triggers pick up or drop for BOTH players, so coordinate, endure the confusion, or mess with your friend however you want!</p>\n<p>Stage 2 - Player 1 uses joystick to steer up+down, Player 2 uses A/square to shoot. Watch out! If you\u2019re hit, it\u2019s back to the build phase.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>\n<p><strong>Produced by:</strong><br/>Michael Biggers - Programming<br/>Bobby Brace - Programming and Scrum Management<br/>Jessica Dungca - Art and Team Lead<br/>Jordan Hamann - Art and Animation<br/>Erica Lee - Art, SFX, and UX Research</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/881/8816bf8dd929f4b64f2b61d85180bd49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["e-mr"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
