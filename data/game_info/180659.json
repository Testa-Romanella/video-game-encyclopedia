This is my first GBGameJam, please be gentle!</p><p>So this is a concept of mine to have a survival-style battle where you have a lineup of characters fight against another lineup of enemies, where the battles are determined in a very small amount of turns. Currently, the battle scales linearly as you defeat more enemies (and will scale toward your characters as more of your guys have been defeated).</p><p>Lose all your health, and your character dies. If you have other characters still alive (represented by the hearts) the next one in line will move up to fight.</p><p>Armor soaks up damage. Each point of armor will negate a point of damage being done to health.</p><p>You have four main types of actions: Attack, Defend, Utility, and Support. Attack deals damage, Defend gives you armor, Utility offers a chance to strip your opponent's armor, and Support heals you.</p><p>Each different character has a different set of base stats that will determine how effective a different action is.</p><p>The actual amount you attack/heal will also be affected by a low/mid/high roll, introducing an RNG element.</p><p>I would like to explore balance options and strategical depth, so your feedback is very welcome and important in seeing how far we can go with such a simple model!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25b/25b581f859c31886a3ca975d75db60e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["darkkal"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
