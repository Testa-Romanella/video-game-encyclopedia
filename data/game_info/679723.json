{"id": 679723, "slug": "manicas", "name": "MANICAS", "name_original": "MANICAS", "description": "<p>Maniacs is a horror survival game on Unity and to this date, this is the most professional game development that I created. Using post-processing to create stunning graphics; coding C#; the AI in this game are far more intelligent (depends on the difficulty); creating the mechanics for stealth and combat; using a custom load screen, main menu, options menu and an interactive inventory menu. Maniacs is aimed at anybody who loves game design and want to make awesome games and in this FPS game, the main character has to try and survive against a gang of maniacs who are armed with a variety of weapons.\u00a0</p><p>I started by creating the visuals to establish a night time look for my game then equipping the player with a flashlight and a night vision camera. Afterwards, I moved onto lighting the scene to create an interesting aesthetic quality by adding fog for atmosphere, as a result, to give it a professional quality look. Adding sounds and music made the game to bring the scene to life and importing enemy characters to add walking, running and attack animations using the mecanim animator window on Unity to smoothen the blend between the motions. The navigation pathfinding and AI (artificial intelligence) allowed the enemy characters to make their own decisions on where to go and what to do. However, once the enemies detect you, they will discover their own different ways to hunt you down! The player inventory menu is displayed on the weapons you have picked up. Each weapon has its different strength, speed and noise. The stealth mechanics allowed the main character to attempt to sneak around the map unnoticed. The harder the difficulty, the enemies are more clever and can easily spot you as they will go into pursuit mode. The combat system of Maniacs is simple, you attack and they will retaliate back. Although, choosing the right weapon to try and kill enemies is crucial because they fast and very strong, therefore, you don't want to waste time! so come with a strategy on defeating the enemies. I added a save system so I can save and load my progress between sessions. On the main menu and the options menu, I can change lighting, volume and switching the antialiasing, fog on or off and most importantly I can change the difficulty.\u00a0<br/></p><p>Making previous games whether, on Unity, Godot or Unreal Engine gave me the skills, confidence and understanding of how to make my own games and progress as a game developer.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T09:00:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6a/c6a2041ad1d314f13776505c796c9dd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AAhmed9"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
