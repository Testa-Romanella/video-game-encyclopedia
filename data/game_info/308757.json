{"id": 308757, "slug": "keep-of-the-mad-wizard", "name": "Keep of the Mad Wizard", "name_original": "Keep of the Mad Wizard", "description": "<p><em>Keep of the Mad Wizard</em> is a single-player text-based RPG of the dungeon crawl variety, with randomized elements. It comes in a gamebook-like format, and can be played online or offline.\r\n</p>\n<p>The game is meant to be replayable. It's a coffeebreak game that can be completed in about 10 minutes once you are familiar with it. But each time you'll get a different challenge, so pay attention to your resources! (See the built-in help for how to play.)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>System requirements:</strong> Any modern web browser. Firefox 45 and Opera 45 both work, not sure about older versions. It also runs on mobile devices, though a screen width of 1024px is ideal.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>For developers</strong>: As stated in the credits, <em>Keep of the Mad Wizard</em> is made with Tweego, the command-line cousin of Twine, and is released under the Artistic License 2.0, a copy of which is included in the source archive. You can compile the latter with tweego -o mad-wizard.html src. No special options are needed, but you need the default SugarCube 2 format installed.</p>\n<p>As of 10 April 2019, the game is considered complete, barring tweaks and bug fixes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-12T05:37:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e00/e001f78163c6c8da69c26737a975482b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["No Time To Play"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
