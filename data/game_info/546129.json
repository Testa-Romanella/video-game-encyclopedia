How you do it is up to you...but there is one hitch. Wizard decorum forbids open disagreement\u00a0 among wizards. (It\u2019s considered rude to contradict one elders. Unfortunately, since we all do a lot of time magic, it\u2019s impossible to discern who our elders are).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This makes diplomacy and decision-making awkward at best. Although we can\u2019t disagree verbally, according to wizard etiquette, you can present an alternative or look straight into your crystal ball and take a sip of your beverage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boundaries of exactly what counts as \u201cdisagreement\u201d are fluid...<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>The Wizard's Querulous Dram is a light, silly live action game designed by Lizzie Stark &amp; Jason Morningstar to work well with all remote players, play in about an hour, and be really fun!</em><br/></p>\r\nLogistics:\r\n<ul><li>Participants: 3-6 players</li><li>Time: 60 minutes</li><li>Technology:\u00a0Video chat</li><li>Materials:\u00a0\u00a0Beverage in a cup for each player (fancy cups encouraged)</li></ul>\n<strong>What's Included?</strong>\n<ul><li>10 page PDF\u00a0</li></ul>\n<strong>Questions?</strong>\n<p>Comment here, or get in touch with us at info@bullypulpitgames.com.</p>\n<strong>Effusive Praise?</strong>\n<p>We're on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0Instagram.
