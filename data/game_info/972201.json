Unable to respond directly under the fragile political climate, the Joint Security Alliance has turned to a special helicopter squadron known as the Heli-Cats. Their mission is to repel the invaders under the guise of a local paramilitary unit such that all actions can be disavowed should things go wrong.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Take control of pilots \u201cTiger\u201d and \u201cLynx\u201d, either together in a single helicopter or individually in two machines, as they battle their way through enemy lines and uncover the reasons behind the instigations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Push the elevation button to switch between high and low elevations.<br/><br/>High projectiles are yellow and low ones are red. (The color combo can be changed as an option.)<br/>Ammo can only damage targets of the same elevation for both players and enemies.<br/>So while traditionally unavoidable enemy fire can now be rendered completely safe, players must still put themselves in harm's way in order to defeat enemies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Tapping the shot button fires a burst of normal ammo.<br/>Hitting and destroying enemies with a normal shot increases the focus counter.<br/><br/>Holding the shot button fires a more powerful focus shot that consumes the focus counter.<br/>Some enemies also shoot lighter colored focus ammo that are greater in quantity but slower in speed.<br/><br/>Use the focus shot to cancel them and break through the barrage with ease.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regular enemies destroyed with the focus shot drop orbs.<br/>Collecting them fills the level gauge and powers up both normal and focus shots when the next level is reached.<br/><br/>The green power gauge that appears depletes only when normal shots are used. The player goes down a level when out of power.<br/>Stay at the maximum level by replenishing the power gauge with more orbs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scoring in Heli-Cats is very simple. Survivability and score potential are at opposite ends of the difficulty spectrum.<br/><br/>Survivability: High, Score: Low<br/><ul><li>Power up often</li></ul><ul><li>Keep away from enemies</li></ul><ul><li>Use the focus shot regularly</li></ul><ul><li>Bomb often</li></ul><br/>Survivability: Low, Score: High<br/><ul><li>Avoid powering up</li></ul><ul><li>Shoot enemies at very close range</li></ul><ul><li>Avoid using the focus shot</li></ul><ul><li>Avoid using bombs</li></ul><br/>Players have to find the right balance on this difficulty scale and adjust their strategy according to skill level.<br/><br/><br/>Knowing when to utilize these systems is the key to victory!<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>Dual elevation gameplay allows an extra layer of strategy to avoid enemy fire<br/></li><li>Local co-op<br/></li><li>2 initial helicopters to choose from (more can be unlocked with progress)<br/></li><li>8 arcade stages (2 more can be unlocked under special conditions)<br/></li><li>Multiple endings depending on performance and uncovered secrets<br/></li><li>In-game credits system that unlocks new modes, upgrades, and customization of the game<br/></li><li>Fully assignable gamepad and keyboard button controls</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-17T06:43:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11ad2c387bb99c62e3524cf3abcfa0bb.jpg", "website": "https://www.drearyweary.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 123, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["drearyweary"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DrearyWeary"], "esrb_rating": null}
