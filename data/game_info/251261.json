Then read on!\r\n<p><strong>Crystal Mech</strong> is a\u00a0Top-Down Sci-Fi-Magic Bullet Hell. It's designed as a <strong>co-operative </strong>game for <strong>1-4</strong> <strong>players</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Crystal Mech</strong> was created by a team of 8 people [4 programmers, 4 artists]\u00a0for the annual DAE\u00a0Crea-Week <strong>Game Jam</strong>. This Game Jam started on Wednesday-morning, the\u00a02nd of\u00a0May 2018, and lasted until Friday the 4th of May at noon, so all in all that's <strong>2 and a half days</strong> of work!\u00a0The theme of the game jam was \"<strong>Magic &amp; 3 Rules</strong>\".\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Crystal Mech</strong> is a Top-Down Sci-Fi-Magic Bullet Hell, in which <strong>1-4 players</strong> can team up, and try to defeat <strong>hordes </strong>of enemies! Each player will play as a <strong>Mech</strong>, with a big, colorful <strong>Crystal </strong>at it's core. The Mech can be configured into <strong>3 different modes</strong>, the shape and color of the crystal changes with each form. Each mode has<strong> 2 powers </strong>associated with it.</p>\n<p>The first mode is the <strong>offensive </strong>mode, represented by the <strong>Red </strong>crystal. In this mode, the Mech can rapidly shoot <strong>Magical Missiles</strong>, or a slower, but very powerful <strong>Laser</strong>!</p>\n<p>The second mode is the <strong>defensive</strong> mode, represented by the <strong>Yellow </strong>crystal. When using this configuration, the Mech can put down small semi-permanent <strong>shields</strong> or large\u00a0spherical temporary shields.\u00a0The Enemies' Magic Missiles bounce off of these shields!</p>\n<p>The third and last mode, is the <strong>Utility</strong> mode, represented by a <strong>Blue</strong> crystal. In this mode, the Mech is able to <strong>run </strong>speedily, and <strong>heal</strong> itself and other nearby Mechs.</p>\n<p>We ended up getting the <strong>fourth place </strong>[out of 15 contestants], and are all really proud of what we were able to make in such a short period of time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/039/0392e59f1ad8047940880a8760d50373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 99, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Glenn van Waesberghe", "Robin Strubbe", "dierickxmathias", "Ewout-VanGasse"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
