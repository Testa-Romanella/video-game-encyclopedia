The slider represents the speed of the algorithm, how many steps it may take per small time unit. 11 (default) will result in full speed instead of 11 steps per time unit.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The button is there so you can use the algorithm again! Enjoy the random generations :)</p>\n\n<p>Wave Function Collapse in short? The idea is to pick a random spot and a random 'level tile' (3D object containing f.e. a roadpiece\u00a0or a house). After placing that object, the algorithm then updates the neighbouring spots, to restrict the options left for that particular spot based on the (previously)\u00a0chosen tile. If this was too complicated, don't worry! There are wayy better explanations on YouTube f.e.\u00a0:)<br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:56:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cd38d16244a2817cb520e5fe9aa50a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Teambeurnaut"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
