They drew\r\npower from the very fluidity of their movements, merging positioning\r\nand combat prowess as one, and creating a kind of war dance to suit\r\ntheir destructive notions.</p>\n<p>You play a novice member of this order,\r\nand must learn the intricacies of this unique style to overcome the\r\ndesert fiends that assail you.</p><p>--NOTE ABOUT THE POSTRELEASE VERSION<br/>It came to my attention shortly after release that some of the graphical effects in the game had a tendency to make the player physically ill. This was of course not the intention, so I've added an option to disable the spinning (F2), as well as larger font sizes when the resolution increases. These were the only two additions, no other features were added, so for those of you who aren't judges I recommend playing the postrelease version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-11T03:46:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/4425619a2302e4b5dc622b76eb16a21e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Chao"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
