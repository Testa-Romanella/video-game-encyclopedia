The visuals are aimed to be\u00a0 neutral and aesthetic, trying to \u00a0clearly convey the important bits of information to the Player. Every new game session is randomly generated, and no two sessions will be exactly the same. The game employs <strong>simple, intuitive point and click input</strong>, in order to be easy to pick up.\u00a0 Just don't make any rash actions, think ahead and the game will be a breeze to win!<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>This game was entirely conceptualized, designed, programmed and artwork was created over the course of the allocated 48 hours by Aniruddha Hardikar, a solo developer, for the BYOG competition at IGDC 2018.\u00a0 Made with Unity and Blender, the game runs on Windows for now, while versions for mobile platforms are planned.<br/> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd2/dd24d73129d83a9113a870c8ad45d64b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["aniruddhahar"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
