In the Side Story you join Neyru, Rethis, Shi'ar and Chathien as they hunt the inter-dimensional criminal Kast. This fantasy RPG has each frame hand animated to emphasize the style of the characters and bring Team tactic role-playing battle to life beyond super-deformed or icon driven battles.  The side story  is representative of the final game that we seek to finish and we hope you see what we have always loved.  A great story.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-05T02:48:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eb7/eb7965b598653addba806e02b85c7969.jpg", "website": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lot9swords/legend-of-the-9-swords?fbclid=IwAR3h_KjajFz79yuZlmM4eHUEpHw7_9OjbktRBbpGH-dtn4HCEojHX5anuik", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Christopher Rodrigues"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Sunstar Gaming Productions"], "esrb_rating": null}
