Somewhy you decided it'd be a good idea to explore through every part of the world and every bit of your imagination. Drive your SUV through areas such as the <strong>jungle, desert, labyrinth, space meteorite</strong>, and other \"ordinary\" stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n- What time is it?\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou don't need to worry about the time, lad. Unless you want to receive the highest score to satisfy yourself, you can take as long as you wish to complete the level. Or try to be a perfectionist and complete each level within a second. Your decision.\r\n</p>\r\n- Fun\r\n<p>\r\n\tDon't worry! \r\n\t<strong>All the levels are unlocked</strong> from the start so you don't need to beat yourself up if you can't complete one level!\r\n</p>\r\n- Why a volcano?\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhy not? I decided it would be nice for you guys to drive around literally everywhere, so relax and let your imagination flow.</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>This game is developed by a 15-year-old starting developer.</strong> I will probably be working on other projects later, so stay tuned!\r\n</p>\r\nHere are the controls:\r\n<p>\n<strong>Arrow keys</strong>, well you don't need an explanation for this do you?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>M</strong> to open the map. Not all levels include a map.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>P</strong> to pause the game.
