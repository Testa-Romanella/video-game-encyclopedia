Your objective is to go as deep as you can, fighting monsters and collecting treasures. Manage your energy wisely or your elevator will shut down and who knows what awaits then...</p>\n<p>If you need to restock or upgrade your gear, you can return to the shop located on the surface. Here, you can purchase new weapons, armor, and other helpful items\u00a0with the gold you've collected in the dungeon. They also sell energy!</p>\n<p>However, be careful not to get too greedy or overconfident. The deeper you go, the tougher the monsters become. Make sure you're well-equipped and ready for battle.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n\n<p>Credit goes to SmartPoetic for the music.</p>\n<p>smartpoetic.newgrounds.com/audio</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-24T09:23:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b96/b963fda37017945533a0dc994726678e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["hans8425"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
