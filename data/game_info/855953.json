{"id": 855953, "slug": "melting-slimes", "name": "Melting Slimes", "name_original": "Melting Slimes", "description": "<p>A game where you need to help Slimes make it to the end of the level. You can do this by making them change forms. Each form has different abilities!</p>\n<p>This game was made for the VimJam 3, a game jam hosted by Vimlark and 8 bits to infinity. It's a jam with a limitation and a theme. The limitation was: 'Multi-Use'. The theme was: 'Turn up the heat'.</p>\n<p>The game is Multi-Use since you can transform the Slimes into multiple forms and back. Slimes are also very susceptible to heat and as such will slowly melt when it gets too hot (which is the case in some levels).</p><p><strong>Controls\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Move the camera\r\n</li><li>Mouse Wheel - Zoom in/out\r\n</li><li>1 through 9 - Select Form\r\n</li><li>Click on Slime while having a Form selected transforms it.\r\n</li><li>Right-Click on a transformed Slime to revert it to normal.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Forms</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Stop - Doesn't let other Slimes pass, it turns them around instead.</li><li>Bounce - Gives other Slimes that pass over it a jump boost, allowing them to reach other places.</li><li>Parachute - Slimes can die when they fall from high spaces. A parachute is the perfect counter to this!</li><li>Cushion - Sometimes, you don't have enough parachutes. Transforming into a cushion will break the fall of any Slime that lands on your head.</li><li>Platform - Who needs ground when you can become your own ground?</li></ul>\n<p>In the making of this game, I discovered that I'm not good at Level Design. So I added a Level Editor so you can make your own (better) levels. The game comes preloaded with 14 'official' levels which teach you the basics. This is all I could manage in the time limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Victory Conditions</strong></p>\n<ol><li>Save X Slimes<ol><li>You have to get X Slimes to the exit to win the level.</li></ol></li><li>Save King Slime<ol><li>You have to get King Slime to the exit to win the level.</li><li>King Slime spawns as the last Slime.</li><li>King Slime cannot transform, as that is beneath him.
