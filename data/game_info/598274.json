(seriously. always put your cursor at the high end of the screen to avoid frustration.\u00a0 trust me.)</p>\n<p>its kinda sad but I had only 2 spare days to work on this project, so one jam day is wasted. and sadly I will not be able to play and rate other games before rating period is over.</p>\n<p>ho, and why the frog can't flip? coding is hard.</p>\n<p>hope you all have a great day, and have fun!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-03T07:15:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d49/d492a19dd33000b350202b386f473fa7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["littlepuly"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
