Me and my children made it during #AltCtrlGameJam - I uploaded a version with keyboard controls:</p><p>UP arrow - go up, but you must \"pump\" the key<br/>LEFT arrow - activate left engine, move right<br/>RIGHT arrow - activate right engine, move left<br/>SPACE - activate/deactivate magnet</p><p>You can do the mission (NPCs will tell you) or just look around.<br/>The windows version is untested, contact me if there are any problems!<br/></p><p>Here's the trailer/demo video: https://youtu.be/d56h1ODsm20<br/><br/>I documented the project on twitter and vine and a detailed postmortem will follow soon.
