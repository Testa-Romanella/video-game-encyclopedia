The theme of the jam was to re-create a game-mechanic from another game, in another dimension. <br/><br/>We chose to re-create the mechanic from Bulletstorm, in which the player has an electric whip, which can be used to pull enemies towards you. When close, enemies then enter a stasis mode, where they are slowed. Furthermore, we decided to add the kick as well, where enemies will fly for a short duration, and then enter stasis mode.<br/><br/>Sadly we didn't complete the game, so there is no point-system or real game-loop, however, it serves more as a playground for the whip, kick and stasis mechanic re-creation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:01:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/ecceb926fa4b2256cbc81e000635d6d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nostalgia", "Robbss", "Neebzan", "Gesspar"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
