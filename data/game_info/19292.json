Avernum is a land underground, a subterranean nation full of rogues, misfits, and brigands, struggling for survival and wealth in the monster-infested darkness. \n</p>\n\nYou have been banished to the underworld, never to see the light of day again.\n\n\nThe surface is ruled by the cruel Emperor Hawthorne, master of the Empire. All of the known lands are subject to his brutal command. Everyone who speaks out, misbehaves or doesn\u2019t fit in is cast into the dark, volcanic pits of Avernum, far below the surface. There, you are expected to die, a victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair.\n\n\nBut not all of the Avernites have surrendered. With magic and steel, they are forging a new nation deep underground. You can join them and fight for safety. Or freedom. Or, if you dare, revenge on the surface-worlders who tried to destroy you. Join your new countrymen, explore a huge game world, hunt for hundreds of magical artifacts, choose from hundreds of quests, and become the hero of the underworld!\n\n\nKey features\n<ul>\n<li>Epic fantasy adventure in an enormous underworld.\n<li>Huge outdoors, eighty towns and dungeons, and hundreds of quests.\n<li>Three separate game-winning quests.
