Now I want to tell a story, and do something different from a RPG.\r\nSo I decided to make GUILT, a stealth/horror game made with Game Maker Studio.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nGUILT tells the story of a woman lost in a dark forest. The atmosphere is heavy and there doesn't seem to be anything alive in it, but she has to go through it.\r\nWhile exploring, strange things happen around her as she comes across things that shouldn't be in the middle of a forest. \r\nDiscover what's going on in this dark place, why she's here and try to lead her to a safer place.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tThe main focus of GUILT is exploration. You'll have to walk your way through the forest, sometimes you'll need to jump, climb, ...\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tBut something is in this place. Something follows the woman. She'll have to hide. She'll have to sneak through them. If they see her, then her only hope will be to run... But will that be enough?</p>\n<p>You can see some live gameplay here. More videos may be available soon!</p>\n<p><strong>YOUTUBE<br/></strong>You are free to post videos of the game on Youtube or other video streaming services, even if monetized. The only condition is to not claim the game as your own; the rest is up to you (a link to the game's page is highly appreciated though!).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fceaea7e4568ded8d0b0890e52d39d14.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 157, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ylzor"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
