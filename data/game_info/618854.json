To resolve some emergency situations and rescue spaceships, a special commercial organization was created. You are part of an elite space rescue organization (ESRO) operating in the most dangerous place in the solar system - the asteroid belt. There are many spaceships that need your help. Your goal is to rescue astronauts and commercial spaceships from crashed spaceships and survive as long as possible. Your rescue ship is equipped with laser cannons to destroy meteorites and asteroids. They are very efficient but require a lot of electricity. To replenish electricity, you will need to use emergency satellites. And always remember - you are the hope of people. Successful flight,\u00a0 rescuer!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T12:20:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b5/0b5a9ff565abca1cbaffc070cae8c529.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mustafa_Huseynov"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
