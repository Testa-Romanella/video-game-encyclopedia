So yeah, I'm embarrassed by this one...</p><p>PS: I can't believe I didn't explain this in game, but you need to click on the inventory items underneath the car in order to put them in. If you don't have all three items and put one or two in, you lose it forever. Such an old broken game of mine, why did I publish this game? Seriously, what was I thinking.<br/></p>\n<p>Story: You wake up in an unknown facility, with a flashlight in hand, and monsters lurking around every corner.
