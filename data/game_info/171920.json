This is Fuu Team's submission for My First Game Jam 2018's Winter run. At present it is a prototype for a speed-oriented 3D platformer. There is one level to explore. If an enemy shoots or rams into you, the level resets.</p>\n<p>This game was designed around using an xboc 360 controller, but should be doable with any given controller. That said, other controller button layouts might be slightly different, and you may have to experiment if using a different controller.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Left stick moves Fuu, right stick rotates the camera.</p>\n<p>A Button -&gt; jump<br/>A Button (in air) -&gt; glide<br/>B Button -&gt; spin (animation present but unimplimented)<br/>X Button (on ground) -&gt; Burst Dash<br/>Y Button (on ground) -&gt; Rocket boost (hold for higher boost)</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing!</p>\n<p>Credits, in no particular order:</p>\n<p>Music: Laryssa Chan<br/>Programming/Production: James Ensley<br/>Art and animation: Kevin Cannon, Anastasia Korolev, Megan Maniago, nirwana.96, CaitWIN<br/>SFX: dtangney<br/>Design/Art Direction: Shoutscion(@shoutscion)<br/>Level Design: Plum</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/134/134f60cb7900d96a652fd7eab2dbaead.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SolaceEternal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
