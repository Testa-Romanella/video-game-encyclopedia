There is no reason why they should not work on other platforms however. They are written in Rust and have a dependency on C libraries SDL2 and SDL_gfx. I don't think there would be any issues compiling for Linux or Windows, but I can't support those platforms.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-27T02:42:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/973/9730f5f9e8c98474f4af3a688d80daef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Liam O'Connor"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
