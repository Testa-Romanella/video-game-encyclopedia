The pieces must be moved to certain objectives on the somewhat non-standard board. However, the game generously allows you to design your own moveset for the pieces. <br/></p>\n<p>Made for the GMTK 2019 Game Jam, with the theme \"Only one\".</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> <br/></p>\n<p>The game works in two stages:<br/>1. Design a chess move by choosing three directions in the right panel. This move will be used by all pieces.<br/>All symmetric moves will also be allowed.<br/>2. Move all pink pieces to the pink tiles and all black pieces to the black tiles, without capturing any pieces. The pieces may not be moved before exactly three moves are added in the design phase. <br/></p>\n<p>Use the reset \"R\" button to reset the board and the moveset.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming:</strong> Erik \"Skelpdar\" Wallin<br/><strong>Art:</strong> Marcus \"Alkuuda\" Tegerhult</p>\n<p><strong>Music:</strong> Island Love by archos1 (CC BY-NC 3.0)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T23:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e148997ab42d32d3434dc76e153b274.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Skelpdar", "Alkuuda"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
