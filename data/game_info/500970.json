In this game, the <em>code </em>executes <em>you</em>!\r\n<p><strong>It starts off very simple and gets out of hand quickly.</strong> Play as a little blue robot collecting cookies and chips in a small pixely world. See the code that dictates item spawning and enemy movement. Break out of an infinite and randomly-generated series of while loops of increasing difficulty and speed, or else the enemies being spawned will threaten your ability to keep playing.</p>\n<p>This project was a lot to take on for me, and I will be the first to admit I neglected quite a few things (UI, <strong>music</strong>, and art, namely). I am, however, glad that I got all of it to fit the \u201cold computer\u201d aesthetic and be playable! This is my first Ludum Dare and I was determined to submit to the Compo, so I\u2019m considering it a success regardless :)</p>\n<p>Check out the page on the Ludum Dare website: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/whiletrue-1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T03:30:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e7e/e7e6173534f180bb56772bed9881abf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Noah"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
