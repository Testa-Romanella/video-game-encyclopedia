Ugh, another Covid news.<br/>\"Ah, the `big bang theory` then? Yes, that's quite interesting,\" His deep gaze made me glanced over my screen ,\"but, have you heard about The Sky Folder?\"<br/>\"The what now?\"<br/>\"The one that fold the sky and neatly bring the stars to their own constellations.\" His hand trace the emptiness as if it weaved some invisible thread in the air.<br/>\"Pulling those humongous stars by itself?\" I chuckled. Here we go again.<br/>\"Eh, worry not, The Sky Folder is bigger than that. It's next to gigantic-humongous creature, or thing, or something.\"<br/>\"Heh, then he'll knock over all the planet as he passed through,\" I put my head back on the pillow and close my eyes. The Sky Folder. Quite a catchy name of another made up creature from him.<br/>\"I met one when I was a kid,\" he sighed, \"and no one believed me.\"<br/>His sad eyes glistened in the dark. He's weird, I know. It's famous feature of him. But I like his weirdness. \"Come on! Let's go the roof now!\"<br/>\"Now?\"<br/>\"Yes! I'll show you how The Sky Folder arrange the stars to put my name in the sky!\" He jumped from the bed and pulled my hand<br/>\"Wait! My phone! Ghah! \" And once again it dropped under our bed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-22T05:45:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/278/2781dd650ea0e5064e893e23e8cb1940.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Giri"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
