Here, we aim to promote synergy and growth amongst our employees, and one of the most important factors in this is a clean work environment. That's where you come in! As our previous janitor mysteriously disappeared on his first day of work, your hiring was pretty rushed, but know we still have the highest of hopes for your performance. On top of your mandatory cleaning duties, there will be many others throughout the office that will require assistance, so keep an eye out for these synergistic growth opportunities. Lastly, before you get started, we've been receiving reports of the elevators malfunctioning, though we assure you this will only be a minor inconvenience. Good luck, and get to work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T08:56:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe05718e599aa735d75a43ae180bf74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Team_Overtime"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
