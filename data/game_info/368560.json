I decided to try to look at the various rules I have begun to follow over the years when it comes to making games. I follow these rules so my games won't be bad, but maybe I'm wrong. So here I try to break them to challenge my assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure if you can beat level 1 you can beat the entire game if you have enough patience. <br/></p><p>Use arrow keys to move. You'll learn about other controls while playing the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-26T05:17:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/395/39533f967fbac02f462bb2de5a1a4ff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BoneDaddy64"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
