{"id": 290707, "slug": "lunark", "name": "LUNARK (itch)", "name_original": "LUNARK (itch)", "description": "LUNARK IS LIVE ON KICKSTARTER\u00a0\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong></strong>is a 2D cinematic platformer in the vein of '80s and '90s classics such as\u00a0<strong><em>Prince of Persia</em></strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong><em>Flashback</em></strong>. Run, jump, hang, climb, roll, and shoot your way through mysterious alien ruins, a flying penitentiary, a high-tech megalopolis, and a majestic forest.</p>\n\n<p>As Earth became inhospitable,\u00a0<strong>Noah</strong>, an AI whose sole purpose was to preserve humanity, was created. Noah chose the Moon as humanity's Ark - renamed\u00a0<strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong>- using it as a ship to evacuate a handful of chosen ones to the nearest superhabitable planet.\u00a0<strong>Unfortunately, whether the planet was inhabited or not was\u00a0not\u00a0part of Noah\u2019s programming</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Centuries later, you play as\u00a0<strong>Leo</strong>, an orphan rejected for being\u2026 different.\u00a0<strong>You'll retrace your origins</strong>\u00a0in the midst of a\u00a0<strong>rebellion against the totalitarian regime of Lunark,\u00a0</strong>and meet a wide cast of colorful characters, stuck on either side of the escalating conflict.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I've\u00a0designed\u00a0<strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong>as a homage to\u00a0<strong>cinematic platformers</strong>\u00a0while bringing\u00a0<strong>modernity\u00a0</strong>to a lot of the core aspects: The controls are responsive and intuitive and the progression system generous. The game is meant to\u00a0<strong>feel fresh while being nostalgic</strong>. <strong>Lunark</strong> is also an<strong>\u00a0</strong>adventure\u00a0focused on delivering a thrilling narrative with explosive moments.</p>\n\n<p>The game will be\u00a0<strong>available on PC (Windows) &amp; Mac (OsX)\u00a0</strong>in\u00a0<strong>English, French,\u00a0</strong>and\u00a0<strong>Spanish</strong>. I hope to be able to add even\u00a0<strong>more platforms and languages depending on how well the campaign and development goes</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You have no idea what a 2D cinematic platformer is?</strong></p>\n<p>\u201cCinematic platformers are action-adventure platformers with a strong\u00a0<strong>emphasis on realism</strong>,\u00a0<strong>cinematic presentation</strong>,\u00a0<strong>detailed character animations</strong>, [...] and a minimalistic approach to storytelling\u201d.\u00a0<em>(\u201cThe Cinematic Platformer Compendium\u201d by\u00a0itchyander)</em></p>\n\n<p>Just like the fantastic games from which\u00a0<strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong>draws its inspirations, I use\u00a0<strong>rotoscoping\u00a0</strong>for the cutscenes\u2019 animation (tracing over motion picture or 3D footage).</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>My name is Johan Vinet</strong>, husband\u00a0and\u00a0father of two. I'm originally from\u00a0France,\u00a0but now live in Montreal, Canada. Although I've worked for several years as a graphic designer, you may know me as a\u00a0<strong>pixel artist</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>animator\u00a0</strong>in the independent video game industry or even have seen that little\u00a0red-haired guy running on twitter. I've contributed to a dozen games such as\u00a0<strong><em>Flinthook</em></strong>,\u00a0<strong><em>Shovel Knight Showdown</em></strong>,\u00a0<strong><em>Adventure Time</em></strong>,\u00a0<strong><em>Mercenary Kings Reloaded</em></strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong><em>Rivals of Aether</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Prince of Persia</em></strong>,\u00a0<strong><em>Another World</em></strong>\u00a0(aka\u00a0<strong><em>Out of This World</em></strong>) and particularly\u00a0<strong><em>Flashback\u00a0</em></strong>have made a significant impact on me as a kid. Seeking to recreate the special feeling conveyed by these games, I started working on\u00a0<strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong>in my spare time.\u00a0<strong>Given the enthusiasm around the project</strong>\u00a0and how my passion grew about it, it became obvious to me that this game had to see the light. In September 2018, I took the leap and decided to quit my job to start my own independent studio:\u00a0<strong>Canari Games Inc</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I was 7 years old when I started music theory and have\u00a0<strong>never stopped playing and composing since</strong>. Everything you hear in\u00a0<strong>Lunark\u00a0</strong>comes from me, music and SFX included. Yet, I\u2019m also enthusiastic about\u00a0<strong>working with other collaborators on Lunark's OST</strong>\u00a0depending on how well the campaign does!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<p>With your support, my goal is to be able to\u00a0<strong>remain fully independent</strong>\u00a0throughout this venture; without having to look for other contracts or business partners, and\u00a0<strong>allowing me to work with talented collaborators</strong>. I really hope to\u00a0<strong>fully realize this personal vision that I have for Lunark</strong>, knowing full well that there's an audience craving for this kind of game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So this is why I need you:\u00a0<strong>for allowing me to create the best version of Lunark possible.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Johan / Canari Games</p>\n\r\nLUNARK IS LIVE ON KICKSTARTER\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n<p><em>&gt; Thanks to illustrator\u00a0<strong>Justin Chan</strong>\u00a0for his amazing cover art!\u00a0<br/>&gt; Everything shown is pre-alpha footage, subject to change (for the better!) in the final version.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-04T04:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/112/1129ac31d5cb65bbc86a467b8cf9227a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Canari Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
