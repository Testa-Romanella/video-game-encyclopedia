To move a piece, click on its square, then on the destination square.</p>\n<p>Place your beads by aligning yourself with your opponent, with one square in between \u2014 a bead goes in that square.</p>\n<p>Capture your opponent's statues by landing on them (except for the last to move \u2014 he's safe. He's the one with a shield).</p>\n<p>On normal and hard levels, four idle rounds (without either a capture or bead placement) result in a draw.</p>\n<p>On hard level, the first statue to move can't move on the second round.</p>\n<p>The source code is available on GitHub.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:47:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ce/1ce59fad0a03485dcdba4d95bb9d4a9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arfeo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
