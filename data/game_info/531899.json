It's been a long time since the humans left and we started repairs to our underground safety zone, your fellow units have been repairing the systems as we wait for the humans to return, but we aren't done yet!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Good news though! We finally received a long range message from the \"Wayfarer\" saying that the humans are almost back to earth! But wait, there are some systems that still need fixing, time to get to work D.R.U!</p>\n<p>RoboReboot is a VR puzzle game where you play as a D.R.U (Disposable Repair Unit) and as the new head of maintenance you must fix the broken systems in your safety zone so the humans will have a place to live when they get back to earth.</p>\n<p>The puzzles range from \"Simon says\" style button pressing to \"Find the missing piece\" object searching.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made within a one week period for the 2020 Epic MegaJam and it was thanks to my amazing team members at \"Artificial Misfits\" that we could even compete this year, so a very special thanks from me to you guys, Kelly, Brad, Mike and Edd. I couldn't have done this without you.</p>\n<p>Also I'd like to give thanks to Glim Music who was courteous enough to make us some music for this game a week prior to the MegaJam starting. The man is legit as hell and I'm happy to share his social media and such as thanks for his hard work as well so go check him out!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Website:\r\nwww.glimmusic.com</p>\n<p>Spotify:\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/2pHMQODSEak6yvtdFGz6Jf?si=G3fG-9GdS5iGNK-4iHsmBg\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apple:\r\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/artist/glim-music/1526015123\u00a0</p>\n<p>YouTube:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7efe0xYQqDA2vhOK7oUtlw\u00a0</p>\n<p>Twitch:\r\nwww.twitch.tv/glimmusic\r\nSocial:\r\nwww.twitter.com/glimmusic\r\nwww.facebook.com/glimmusic\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T08:13:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f28/f282d39b7248057fd2719fb6b472391d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LiterallyJustZach"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
