A truly mind-bending \n      experience, Boingz introduces you to cute, colorful, stretchable friends \n      lost in an alien world, searching for the magical gates that will take \n      them home. Boingz springs to life with 30 levels of puzzle-platforming \n      fun. The Boingz are bendy little critters that can be pulled, stretched, \n      and flicked from place to place like rubber bands. It's a team effort, \n      as all the Boingz will have to work together to unwind the game's \n      puzzles. What's more, many of the Boingz have fallen into a deep \n      slumber, and you'll have to lead the stronger Boingz to find and wake up \n      their sleepy friends. Explore surreal landscapes, sail through the air \n      like a trapeze artist, walk along the seafloor, and collect the \n      Twinklies to power up your elastic-powered flights!\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-12T06:38:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f2/7f2139f1bbcb423d352cdda2b64a73e6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 273, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Wii"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["RealArcade"], "esrb_rating": null}
