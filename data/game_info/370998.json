The clues are all false, you need to find the person that does not have any of the traits. There is a timer that goes towards 0 at which point you loose. You also loose if you pick the wrong person. The additional time you have left is added to your score.</p>\n<p><strong>Game development:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"The game is a liar\" and the game is about finding the guilty when the witness is lying.</p>\n<p>This is the first game I've ever made so there are a few things that can improve. I noticed now that I have disregarded screensize\u00a0differences and this might be a problem, however it seems to work if you don't play in full screen.\u00a0I didn't have time to add sound effects and so on and there are a few other things I didn't have time to add. I like randomly generating stuff so that's what I based the game on.\u00a0Tell me what you think about the game!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T07:57:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d8/7d81900d9b4d05de93c5d50bd378daaa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jensvendsen"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
