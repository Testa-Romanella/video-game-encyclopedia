{"id": 19301, "slug": "counter-strike", "name": "Counter-Strike", "name_original": "Counter-Strike", "description": "<p>Counter-Strike franchise started in back in 2000. Originated as a mod for Half-Life, the developers were signed by Valve Corporation thus beginning the franchise that exists to this very day. </p>\n<p>Having no particular plot or story at all, Counter-Strike was a competitive game mostly used as PvP. With new physics and a large amount of weaponry, you can choose between two fractions - Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. Each team had their signature weapon (CTs had M16 while T had AK-47, for example), the main goal of every round was to kill the opposite team or fulfil a task.  In case there is a bomb plant - detonate or prevent, hostages - rescue or prevent from it or assassination. One player from the team is chosen as a VIP person that must be protected, and the goal of the opposite team is to kill this VIP. By winning every round, you received a good payment, by loosing - much lesser one. You can spend cash on buying equipment and weapon. Counter-Strike franchise is still loved to this day, and even such old shooters live to this day.</p>", "metacritic": 88, "released": "2000-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-22T22:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/9c4/9c47f320eb73c9a02d462e12f6206b26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.04, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 146, "owned": 6578, "beaten": 872, "toplay": 20, "dropped": 1007, "playing": 45}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1536, "suggestions_count": 488, "game_series_count": 5, "reviews_count": 1540, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux", "Xbox"], "developers": ["Valve Software", "Turtle Rock Studios", "Ritual Entertainment", "Barking Dog Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": ["Valve", "Sierra On-Line", "Microsoft Game Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
