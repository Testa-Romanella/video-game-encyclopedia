You spot a small group of punks screwing around in an alley. It is time to show them who is the real owner of theses streets.</em>\n\n\n\n<br/>\n<p>In <em><strong>Aichi Emperors Zero</strong></em> you embody two members of and old biker gang, <strong>battling to death to repeal </strong>the young hooligans who invaded your city. Riding your bike through the city of Yumeshima, you will have to <strong>help each other to defeat the punks</strong>. On your journey, you will face <strong>deadly challenges</strong>. But in the end, <strong>the city will be yours!<br/><br/></strong></p>\n<br/>\r\nDISTRICTS\r\n<p>Your goal is to <strong>claim back your territory</strong> by capturing each of the three districts handled by the punks: <strong>Atsuta</strong>, the northern area and its temple, <strong>Kobaya</strong>, the modern neighbourhood, dominated by the shiba tower, and finally <strong>Shinisho</strong> the business district, and his overwhelming skyline. Gradually taking back Yumeshima will prove your worth as samurai to the disrespectful punks.\u00a0</p>\n<strong>BOSS</strong>\n<p>However,<strong> you will have to face one last challenge before claiming the city as yours.</strong> As you take a hold of the third district, the<strong> leader of the punks</strong> will appear. Bigger and stronger than the average enemy, the boss can create a mystical energy shield, <strong>that you have to break as a team</strong>, using a deadly combo attack : <strong>The Emperor\u2019s Blast !<br/><br/></strong></p>\n\r\nDRIFT\r\n<p>By braking and turning at the same time, you will be able to drift. <strong>The more you skid, the stronger the boost at the end of the drift</strong>. Learn to time your actions, as the game really lives up to its full potential once <strong>you have perfectly mastered your bike and your environment.</strong> </p>\r\nNITRO\r\n<p>Driving around, you leave a glowy trail behind you for your friend. <strong>Following the trail, he will accumulate nitro, </strong>allowing him to catch up on you at full speed. But you can also <strong>gather some on your own by destroying props, doing epic jumps and passing near walls.</strong> Nitro is a helpful and versatile tool that can help you find your teammate, escape the punks or destroy them. <strong>Don\u2019t forget to use it! </strong></p>\r\nRAM\r\n<p>As modern day samurais, <strong>you can use your bikes as much as your weapons to battle your opponents</strong>. Enemies tend to follow around, so lure them into crashing by driving close to walls or obstacles. In a more aggressive way, ramming an enemy at full speed with the nitro will also grant you a nice explosive kill.<br/><br/></p>\n\r\nKICK - PUSH\r\n<p>To defend yourself from the punks, use<strong> the kick: a light attack </strong>that can be performed by <strong>pushing the right hand stick on the left or right</strong>. Much like nitro, it can be used in both <strong>a defensive, and an offensive way </strong>: either by repelling enemies or by throwing them into walls, which will definitely kill them.</p>\r\nKICK - INTERRUPTION\r\n<p>The kick can also interrupt enemy attacks. When a punk tries to attack you, a flashing symbol appears above his head. <strong>If you kick him right before he hits, he will be immediately thrown off his bike to get a taste of the concrete below.</strong></p>\r\nEMPEROR\u2019S BLAST\r\n<p>The Emperor\u2019s Blast is <strong>a cooperative super attack</strong> that unleashes mystical powers upon your enemies. Its principle is quite straightforward: upon reaching your teammate, you can charge you emperor\u2019s blast by pushing the right stick up. <strong>The more you charge it, the more nitro it consumes. </strong>When you release the stick,<strong> you rush to your buddy and trigger the mighty Emperor\u2019s Blast.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anton Salikhov - </strong>Creative Head, Gameplay Programmer [portfolio]<br/><strong>Nicolas Pankowiak -</strong> Producer,\u00a0 AI programmer\u00a0[portfolio]<br/><strong>Victor Depardieu -</strong> Environment artist [portfolio]<br/><strong>L\u00e9o Berret -</strong> Character Artist\u00a0[portfolio]<br/><strong>Paul Rouillard -</strong> 3D Artist, Animator\u00a0[portfolio]<br/><strong>Lucas Bernard -</strong> Game designer, Level\u00a0Designer\u00a0[twitter]<br/><strong>Florent Vieillescazes - </strong>Game Designer, Level Designer\u00a0[portfolio]</p>\n<p><strong>Huge thanks</strong> to everyone who was -\u00a0one way or another -\u00a0involved in the creation of Aichi Emperors Zero.\u00a0 <em>Full credits available in game.</em><br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>POWERED BY<br/></strong></p>\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f RECOMMENDED SPECS\r\n<p>We would recommend to play this game on a high-end pc configuration as it currently lacks optimization. Enemies and vfx can have a heavy impact on performances. If the framerate drops below a certain threshold, to avoid bigger issues we freeze the game physics. Sorry for this inconvenience.</p>\r\n\ud83d\udcdd INFOS\r\n<p>Aichi Emperors Zero was developed during 9 months as a graduation project at Supinfogame Rubika,\u00a0France.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that this game will be not published nor developed further. You can expect small patches to fix some of the issues and maybe optimization, but no big features like online multiplayer, bigger map or anything like that. The development team is now split and everyone is focused on their internships and future career. If you want to support us, the best way to do so is to share this game on social media. This would be awesome and we would be very grateful!</em></p>\r\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<ul><li>Unzip the file</li><li>Read the manual to know more about the game</li><li>Read the readme for known issues</li><li>Launch 'AICHI.exe'</li></ul>\n<p><em>Two controllers have to be plugged in and be assigned controller 1 and 2.</em></p>\r\n\ud83c\udfcd\ufe0f ENJOY!\r\n<p>We hope you'll have fun playing the game and we'll gladly answer to your feedbacks or questions!\u00a0Inquiries: aichi.emperors.zero@gmail.com</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-12T22:23:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f67/f67e4705eefec44c6a39ec2771ce116a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 528, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Supinfogame Graduation Projects", "Aichi", "Paul Rouillard", "Zoryall", "Pankoman"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
