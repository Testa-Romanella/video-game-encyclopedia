Humanity has discovered a new method for quick space travel. The player assumes the role of the pilot on the latest prototype vessel. A series of recent incidents code-named \u201cAnomalies\u201d have been recorded throughout the solar system. The player must visit each location of these anomalies, at varying locations.<br/><br/>During the trip, the player must manage the ship\u2019s fuel and sleep, be aware of cosmic radiation, mechanical failures, and damage to the ship\u2019s hull. The micro-management of these features will constitute important part of the game, encompassed by an overarching story with several plot-twists.<br/><br/>The second most important part of a game will be solving puzzles and fighting enemies.The game will be a combination of story, action, adventure and to some extent survival. A distinguishing feature is diversity and multidimensionality.<br/>I believe that even story driven games should not be played passively.
