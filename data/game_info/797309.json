I did not finish this project because i did not have much time. I plan to finish this game on eg. \"Finish Your Game\" Jam. Paul The Duck was supposed to be a multiplayer game like We Were Here but in isometric view (like my old game hexagon) with unlit graphics like Untitled Goose Project. I planed to add 3 levels.(Funeral House -&gt; Purgatory -&gt; Hell (Player One)\u00a0&amp; Heaven (Player Two))</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T19:37:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efb/efb3c295bd15a123899922ca8b764be2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["NunchakuDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
