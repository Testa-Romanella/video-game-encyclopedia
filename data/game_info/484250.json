Being so open ended, I found it a bit tricky to run at the table, so I made this reference for myself to use. Hopefully useful to other people as well.</p><p>Details:</p><ul><li>One page spell cost flowchart</li><li>9 example spell templates (within 4 spells)</li><li>Detailed breakdowns of each spell's cost, along with potential modifications</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-24T07:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aee/aeea5008a4a5449eca7fa5a47e00d226.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AwkwardTurtle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
