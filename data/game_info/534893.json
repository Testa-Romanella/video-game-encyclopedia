Learned about animating sprites and created my own music!</p>\n\n<p>Find the portal before time runs out and you pop! Gumballs add 3 seconds but expand the bubble, causing it to pop after 4 gumballs. Controls: Left/right arrow keys to move, up arrow key to jump/double jump. Use Bubblegum's stickiness to hop off/up sides of walls. Bubble pop sound repeats when the timer hits zero, it plays normally in the Unity Editor so I'm not sure why it is doing that here.
