Some tales say that this island is the last place souls see before moving on to the afterlife. But when a certain vacationing Elephant stumbles upon a way between worlds, will she unwittingly let something far more sinister slip through?<br/><br/>In <strong>Elephantasy: Flipside</strong>, you play as a tiny Elephant named Belle, who loves to collect shiny gems and magical items. Luckily for Belle (and you), there are a wide array of items to use around the game's world, some new and some familiar to veterans of the first Elephantasy game. You can shrink and grow at will, lift and hurl the heaviest weights, dash faster than ever before, or make objects float in mid-air. Runes can be deciphered, and uncharted depths delved, all with the greatest of ease! But gems aren't the only things to be collected; the island harbours many secrets and treasures, just waiting for an adventurer to find them! Discover lost souls in need of rescue, rare ores that can improve items, keys to open new paths, and much more! As more lost souls are saved, you'll be able to carry more items, and in turn, explore more of the world at your own pace. But be warned: danger lurks around every corner, and sometimes, things are not quite what they seem...<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/><br/><ul><li> Over 150 collectibles to find!<br/></li><li> Over 700 rooms (across 15 different areas) to explore!<br/></li><li> 8 Items to use, upgrade, and enjoy!<br/></li><li> Gorgeous isometric pixel art graphics!<br/></li><li> Challenging platforming and puzzles!<br/></li><li> Multiple endings!<br/></li><li> Cheat codes to decrease difficulty/help with exploration!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T04:36:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db1/db1b117383b016dca0967e7d1d7ec99e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benjamin Maksym"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Maksym"], "esrb_rating": null}
