Yes, you read that right!! It was actually the only newly  developed game for SEGA's 16-bit system in the new millennium. It's not a port, fan translation, or a copy of any other game. Pier Solar is a 100% brand new, entirely original,16-bit RPG.<br/><br/>We'll get right in to what we think makes Pier Solar so special:<br/><ul><li><strong>A 100% Original RPG!</strong> Pier Solar was developed from the ground up. An original world, storyline, soundtrack, characters, enemies, and battle style. No ports, translations or copying from any other game - it's all fresh! The first original 16-bit RPG to do this in over a decade!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>A Massive World to Explore!</strong> Pier Solar has 50+ hours of gameplay, over 300 locations, nearly 500 unique treasure chests, and over 800 NPCs!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Director's cut!</strong> Pier Solar expands what was the biggest 16-bit RPG Ever! We released Pier Solar on a custom 64MEG cartridge (the average SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis game size is 12MEG), making it the biggest 16-bit RPG ever! This allowed us to push the 16-bit medium to a precedent setting level, with state-of-the-art aesthetics and things like full-screen cut scenes, background scaling and 3D modes. But Pier Solar HD is more than just a port, the game is getting a Director's cut, and includes an expanded story with new locations and challenges, that couldn't fit on its original Sega Genesis/Mega Drive release. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Epic Battle Tactics!</strong> We developed an innovative battle system that puts you in control of up to five characters and includes in-depth strategic moves such as counter-attacks and a special strategy called Gather, which stores energy to unleash even more powerful moves and spells!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Translated in 6 Languages!</strong> Pier Solar is translated in 6 languages: English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>An Original Soundtrack!</strong> A beautiful soundtrack written just for Pier Solar that embodies everything great about a classic retro soundtrack!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>There Are Surprises!</strong> We also packed-in many other surprises and secrets like hidden areas and mini-games!</li></ul><br/>Pier Solar truly is a love letter to the rich, imaginative 16-bit RPGs of a bygone era. We crafted Pier Solar in the same light - with an authentic adventure, that resonates deeply about life, death, love, family, and friendship.
