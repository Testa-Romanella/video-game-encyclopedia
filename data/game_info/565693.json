So you're going to have to keep track of the different parts of it to make sure it's working in tip-top shape. There are 3 major\u00a0components of\u00a0the train that you\u00a0will\u00a0want\u00a0to keep\u00a0track of:</p>\n<p>Speed<br/>Warnings<br/>The Radio</p>\n<strong>Speed<br/></strong>\n\r\nPicture of the throttle\r\n<p>The<strong> green button speeds up the train</strong>, while the <strong>red button brings it down a notch</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Pay attention to the sounds</strong> your train makes <strong>and the speed of the tracks</strong> on the horizon <strong>to know when to speed up or slow down</strong>. Note that <strong>attempting to speed up or slow down</strong> when the train is <strong>in its ideal speed</strong> will <strong>result in the loss of water and no change being made to the speed.</strong></p>\n<strong>Warnings<br/></strong>\n<p>There are<strong> two types of warning systems</strong> installed on your train, the first one you will likely notice is the PAT-RN warning system, nobody has any idea what the system actually warns you of, but you should <strong>select the button that matches the one showing on the left-most display.</strong></p>\n\r\nPicture of the PAT-RN warning system\r\n<p>The other warning system warns you about weight imbalances in the train, <strong>when you get an alert about an imbalance, click the dial on the same side as the imbalance.</strong></p>\n\r\nPicture of the weight imbalance warning system\r\n\r\nThe Radio\r\n<p>This one's the easiest to understand, when you go out of range of a radio tower you'll lose signal. Turn the dial next to the radio to regain connection.</p>\n\r\nPicture of the radio", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T06:15:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd7/cd7d332185f7e9a8673e8e76a9cc1a0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FellHawk"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
