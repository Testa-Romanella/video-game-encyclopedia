The theme was \"Shapeshift\", so I made a game where you change shape by pressing the shift key. It is inspired by Super Hexagon, but quite different. this game was made in around 10 hours, as it took me a while to come up with a worthwhile idea for the jam, but I'm still very proud of this simple game and hope you enjoy playing it!</p>\n<p>Font used: Sen</p>\n<p>Music: Magnum by Rondo Brothers, found on the YouTube Audio Library</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-20T02:48:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2b9/2b91fc1e777ec9da86b3aa9fe6b34043.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SphaeriCactus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
