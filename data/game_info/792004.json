The web version is manly a workaround for people without a PC or Laptop to play it.</p>\n<p>After downloading: extract the .zip archive, open the folder and doubleclick on KaelucFragmentsofthePast.exe to start.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play the web version:</strong></p>\n<p>On moblie: Make sure to switch to the desktop website, not mobile! You may have to refresh the page a few times if the game isn't starting or if buttons aren't responding. We tested it on Android and iOS devices and got the VN to work in desktop mode after refreshing the page. It might still be a little clunky and you might have to wait a little for files to load, though.</p>\n<p>On PC: You can play in your browser, but downloading the .zip folder gives you a much\u00a0smoother gameplay and much less lag. If you get the Error \"Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\", try opening the \"developer tools\" window in Chrome by pressing F12 or\u00a0Ctrl+Shift+I and refreshing the page. The developer tools window needs to stay open, but can be placed in the background.</p>\n<p>On either devices you will have to wait for everything to load properly. Refresh the page if it doesn't work after a minute or so.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>\n<p>This story is purely based on and flavored with our own headcanons. That's why, for example, we chose to let Diluc affectionately call Crepus 'Papa'. While we have many different head canons for different kinds of stories (like Crepus as a strict parent), for this story we chose the loving dad Crepus and Diluc as a \u201cdaddy's boy\u201d.</p>\n<p>We also decided that in this story, Kaeya and Diluc have never had any brotherly feelings for each other to begin with. Instead, we focused on \"sworn brothers\u201d as very close best friends/soulmates. That\u2019s why Kaeya doesn\u2019t directly refer to Crepus as his own dad.</p>\n<p>But we also like the idea of Diluc and Kaeya growing up similar to brothers in their early years and only realizing their feelings for each other at a later time. This creates a little bit of a \u201cforbidden love\u201d flair which is also very nice~</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T10:12:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3c/e3cf3b01af72e2fb7a99922d21367b80.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 387, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["hungry_britty"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
