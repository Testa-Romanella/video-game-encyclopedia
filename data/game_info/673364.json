Earth has fallen to a horde of advanced aliens, and the rest of humanity has fled the planet. All that remains are their semi sentient robots called NOUMENON. Previously used to assist humans with daily tasks, operate heavy machinery and clean up and dispose of the humans\u2019 astronomical amount of garbage, these NOUMENON are hearty and vary greatly in function.</p>\n<p>The invading aliens have taken control of the local wildlife and thrown all NOUMENON into trash compacters in various corners of the post-apocalyptic planet. With their world deserted, four of the robots are mysteriously awakened and begin searching for each other. Loyal to a fault, and regardless of how underpowered they may be, the NOUMENON begin their counterassault against the aliens.\r\n</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Noumenon Uprising is a seemingly light-hearted 2D puzzle platformer about 4 robots, lost and separated after an alien invasion of Earth. Take control of Butler, Hardhat, Excav and Zippy as they attempt to meet up and figure out where their human masters have gone. Each robot has one unique action, but you combine all four of them to be able to use all their abilities at once. Progress further through the game to unlock even more powerups to use with each different combination.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T07:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f48/f48235c040235313f86dec838e1bf294.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 125, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nero-Link"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
