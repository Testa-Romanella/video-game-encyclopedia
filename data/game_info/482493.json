Looking to make ends meet, she does the one thing she's good at: killing monsters!</em></p>\n<p><strong>Danger Chaser</strong> is a 2D action platformer with an anime pixel art aesthetic. Run from point A to point B, avoiding or defeating monsters that are in your way.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>How to play (default controls):</strong> Move with the left and right arrows. Jump with the up arrow. Stomp with the down arrow when in the air or on a pass through\u00a0platform. Light attack with 'Z'. Dash with 'A'. You <em>might</em> be able to use controller support if you use custom keybindings, but I haven't tested that out yet.<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback's always welcome!

Maybe pump out 1 more level, add bosses to each Act, \u00a0and give some extra polish, etc. You know, the usual.</p>\n<p>Source code available on my Github page.<br/></p>\r\nCurrent version: Alpha (version0.6.1)\r\n<p>Many graphics are placeholders and can use updating. Most notably the main menu. There are sure to be bugs here and there, although I did try my best to squish them out of this \"vertical\" slice.<br/></p>\n<p>There are two levels, with more to be added in the future. The game kind of just drops you off in the middle of the level select screen with no story or explanation, but whatever, dog.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-21T04:26:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f97/f97b2f57c44099f158f8b5744938f0ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Danger Chaser"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
