You can do this by either shooting the other teams ammo pile,\u00a0or by provoking your opponents to waste their ammo on you.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>You spawn as an empty gun, so you have to go to your\u00a0 ammo pile and pick up some bullets. Doing so will cost your team ammo, so make sure\u00a0you gonna\u00a0make it worth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your teams ammo drops to 0 you loose. If you get killed while still holding bullets, you gonna drop them on the ground\u00a0and other players can pick them up. If you spend to much bullets on\u00a0 enemys who\u00a0 are actually empty, each shot could be a waste, so a disciplined trigger finger is key.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind to hit that Enemy Pile!</p>\n\n<p>The Game offers 6 playable characters, 3 maps and can be\u00a0played with 2-10 players.\u00a0Kill Guns is a solo-project i did for a school exam, and is done in Unreal-Engine using Blueprints only. Current build is about 6 month in development, and i'd call this a first playable Alpha. Lots of things are still in a conceptual state.\u00a0Networking is pretty\u00a0fundamental, so its best played at\u00a0Local Networks.\u00a0However\u00a0you can play it online via steam if you are within the same region.\u00a0 If you can gather some friends with UE4 capable rigs, your good to give it a shot.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you enjoy !</p>\n\n<p>Controlls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Movement</p>\n<p>Mouse - Look around</p>\n<p>Left Mouse Button - Firer</p>\n<p>Right Mouse Button - Aim</p>\n<p>R - reload (only works when close to Ammopile)</p>\n<p>Q - swap character\u00a0(only works\u00a0when close to Ammopile)</p>\n<p>E / middle Mouse Button - Toggle Firemode</p>\n<p>Space - Jump</p>\n<p>Shift - Sneak</p>\n<p>Alt / Mouse Button 4 - Swap Shoulder</p>\n<p>G - Graphics Options</p>\n<p>Help:</p>\n<p>To find the hosted match make sure everybody has steam running when launching the game for playing via web.
