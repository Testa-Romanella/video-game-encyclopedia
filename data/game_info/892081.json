Back to your nightmares, where the cursed and nightmare-ish one are here to haunt you...</em></p>\n<p>Nightmare Before Disney: Back to Hell is created with BGE (Blender Game Engine). And done it in solo.</p>\n<p>Which is it me, and yes. It is my first game with this game engine that nobody cared about. Plus some critics to me...</p><p>Plus note, some things are missing like cameras. Which in case... Might take much longer to make every room and these two rats in DEMO for each camera pose.<br/></p>\n<p>And this demo build, it won't be that great. Of course compiling the .exe might have some errors and bugs, but I might recompile once Range Engine 1.2 is here (which is forked UPBGE!).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-09T09:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d86bd1e79c6b46b51f5049996716a92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Edita2020"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
