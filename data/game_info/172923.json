The theme was 'Running out of Power'. <br/></p>\n<p>A malicious entity is roaming your house looking to kill you, it can only be slowed down with light, your only hope is to survive until dawn by feeding every piece of fuel you can find into the furnace to keep the lights on and keep the monster at bay!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Move around<br/>Mouse - Look around<br/>E - Interact<br/>Mouse button - Use item</p>\n\n<p>[Issues: Collision with the axe is a little bit finicky with some <br/>objects, mostly tables and wooden doors, if you aren\u2019t getting the hit <br/>(there will be a sound) then try stepping away a bit or facing more up <br/>or down. Every difficulty is possible, but I recommend playing on Normal.]</p>\n<p>[Tips: The keys might cause confusion - ideally they would have been colour coded. The \"store key\" unlocks the door in the corridor, the \"kitchen key\" unlocks the two doors between the furnace and the kitchen, the two front doors only open at dawn.\u00a0 Finding the key, getting the axe, and smashing up everything made of wood to stick in the fire, is the way to survive. Wood gives more fuel than paper - but paper can be picked up before you have the axe: paintings and books.]<br/></p>\n<p>Ludum Dare page - https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/static-man<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/736/7360e82b2a3921c86b3e893440a6d607.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BlackmothEntertainment"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
