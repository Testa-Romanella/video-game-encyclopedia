Taxing but feasible within 72 hours.<br/></p>\n<p>To make this fun, I chose to make it a bookworm adaptation, with literary classics (Pinocchio, Jules Verne, King Arthur) instead of movies/cartoon reference.<br/></p>\r\nAren't you cheating a bit here?\r\n<p>Of course I am, that's why it's not rated inside inside the jam itself but sits here as an example/proof of concept.<br/></p>\r\nWhy did you do this?\r\n<p>Because it's fun, but also for a few rational reasons.</p>\n<ul><li>Giving a good deep look at the text and its challenges.</li><li>Trying Omega-T</li><li>Preparing the base material for Fabio's revision stream</li><li>Playing with the design while I waited for jam support</li></ul>\r\nConclusions\r\n<ul><li>Public\u00a0domain\u00a0repositories\u00a0like digitalcomicmuseum.com, oldbookillustrations.com and reusableart.com\u00a0are an\u00a0amazing\u00a0way\u00a0to\u00a0get around the lack of artistic\u00a0talent</li><li>Ditto with bulma.io for web design</li><li>Streaming is a performance.
