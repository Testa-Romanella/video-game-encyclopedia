The game has a female engineer, Alex, who is trying to save the world from angry robots controlled by an A.I.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game should have stealthy feeling but also open fire would be possible. In case things will go south, the player could use a powerful device tied to a \u201cteleport travel\u201d mechanic that will bring back the avatar to the place this device was placed previously. This would be great also for solving puzzles, activating switching and come back before it is too late, avoiding bullets and horrible deaths, and so on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even though the design and the assets are in an advanced stage of production, we have managed only to deploy a small demo of the game (more content soon).</p>\n<p><strong>Pitch</strong></p>\n<p>Alex is going to shut down the main relays which keep active evil robots controlled by a powerful A.I. who has taken the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Brief:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The outside environment looks worn down and destroyed. </li><li>The robots would initially start unaware of you, but if you step into their sight lines they pursue you. </li><li>We choose a retro feeling palette trying to be accessible for colour blinded people (at least the common types). We shifted the classic game boy greenish palette to a blue-violet one.</li></ul>\n<p>This small demo was made possible by the following people:</p>\n<p><strong>Game and Level Designer: </strong>Harbrus<br/><strong>Game Programmer:</strong> scottthepotato<br/><strong>Game Artist:</strong> any%<br/><strong>Sound Designer:</strong> Kapden</p>\n<p><em>Construct3 was used to develop the game.</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately there were some issues with this engine. One of this issue was the events limit that forced us to forgo some of the planned features. We will complete the game with a premium version or a totally different engine.</p><p>The concept art of Alex among the screenshots was made by amaranthineart (check her work\u00a0on instagram @amarathinedl).</p>\n<p>Good game,</p>\n<p>Harbrus and the Team.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/39f/39fdb67330a4c4e319a7cc661088054d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Harbrus"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
