In the game you need to try to\u00a0dodge errors from the programming language, which were hard to dodge even while coding the game ;-)\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was made with the pyGame library, and it was a lot of fun! It was very interesting trying to learn a new language and building a game with no game engine. Even though I definitely could have put more work to it, I think the finished game is a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>Jump with the left mouse button, spacebar or up-key</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T07:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df1a2c99b4457b3341024dada882608.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Meteoroetem"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
