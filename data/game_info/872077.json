If you want to play this game you must list your email associated with your epic games account to play Online. JUST YOUR EMAIL NOT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH IT. You can even create a new account to use if you want to. You'll receive an invitation to Epic Dev Portal which will give you access to play the game online.
