I wanted to try out C# instead of gdscript, and ended up having a blast.<br/></p>\n<p>You play as a Plumber from the future tasked to clean up the blobs from the sewer. Unfortunately, you dropped modules from your gun and now have the additional chore of <em>assembling</em>\u00a0back your gun.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme: Assembly Required</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Your gun has a 3x6 grid that you will slowly insert connectors/upgrades as you complete the\u00a0levels, but the upgrade would only work if you manage to arrange it so that it connects with it's adjacent tiles and forms an uninterrupted path to the core.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildcard:</strong>\u00a0<strong>Thermometer</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Everytime you have a connecter exposed/unconnected, your letting the gun's power source leak out heating up your weapon. This is an old tech, and getting bumped around will destabilize the core - leading to more leakage. Be mindful of the temp gauge at the right of your upgrade grid, otherwise your gun might explode taking you with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildcard: Four Color Limit</strong><br/></p>\n<p>The color used are: #282328 (Black), #545c7e (Dark Blue), #d75778 (Pink), and #dcdcdc\u00a0(off white). Big shoutout to Lospec, for being a good source of color palletes\u00a0\ud83d\ude05 (I used a more saturated version of Bittersweet by porcierlius). This was a fun challenge, and definitely learned a lot!</p>\n\n<p>As always, thank you so much for playing, and feedback is always appreciated (also, would love to\u00a0know your high score \ud83d\ude01)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-23T06:48:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f72/f7278bbbfc7886c598e4204e9ffd0d69.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Loremm"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
