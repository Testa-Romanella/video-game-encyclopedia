I'm sorry but I had a deadline.<br/></p>\n<p><strong><em>DEV NOTES</em></strong><br/></p>\n<p>I now know that there is another game for this exact same jam which has a robot called Bob02. I'm sorry, but in my defense, I had no idea I was copying. I will probably make a post jam version later since there was a lot I wanted to do, but couldn't. Also, thanks to \"guizero\" for helping out with coding.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-06T05:07:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e3f/e3fcf436e57153feeea14d29e27dc6e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Drunko"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
