{"id": 774810, "slug": "jyanken-robot", "name": "Jyanken Robot", "name_original": "Jyanken Robot", "description": "<p>Game Instruction:</p>\n<p>In each round, the player would draw 3 cards and the computer would also draw 3 cards. The computer would randomly choose 1 card to play and the player needs to choose 1 card to win the opponent based on the rules of rock paper and scissor. But when the player gets either 3 different types of cards in hand, the player would get a black card which would win the opponent under all circumstances unless the opponent also plays a black card; if the player/ opponent got 3 same type of cards in hand, then the card the player or the opponent play would have 3 points once won. Once won, player/opponent can choose to whether to attack-deduce the score of the other or defend-add the score of themselves. Whoever gets score of 5 would win.</p>\n<p>Click to interact with the card</p>\n<p>Statement of merits:</p>\n<p>I think the addition of strategy would definitely be a merit for our game as then the player can choose to strategize on their options which make the games more controllable instead of just a luck game. Besides some juice effect like the change of button color when chosen and the addition of different audio in accordance to different scenarios also give players instincts on how the game might work so they will not be stuck while playing the game. The addition of the black card and the 3 points card would also be a fun mechanism to explore, if I have any spare times to work on it, I might also incorporate the mechanism of dissolution and the combination of different cards and the rank system. I think what I need to work on more might be the addition of more juice effect, maybe the layout of the map should be changed a bit more such as delineating the battle zone discard zone and draw zone etc. So maybe the players would be more aware of what's happening or setting the attack defense button on the chosen card.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T05:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5df/5df863eb5cca3770152c377507fe06e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Firemanwolf"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
