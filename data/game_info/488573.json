Whatever, just save the plants by blasting bees to slow them down while you push the evil TV outta here!</p>\n<p>Controls are W-A-S-D\u00a0to move and mouse button to shoot. Reload your gun at the back of the greenhouse when you run out of sprays. Gamepads should work, but they have not been tested. Linux and Mac builds (when available) have also not been tested, but should work in theory.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING: </strong>The visuals in this game are kind of flashing and at times a bit much. If you have any tendency to be bothered by such things, you might want to avoid playing.</p>\n\n<p>This was made for the HEXCODE SHOWDOWN JAM, using the Funky Future 8 palette. Time was definitely an issue, please forgive:</p>\n<ul><li>Lack of transitions</li><li>Lack of balanced mechanics</li><li>No background music and limited audio in general</li><li>Minimal level variety</li><li>Missing fun? Maybe some of this is in there</li></ul>\n<p>I started with a freaky look using the selected color palette and then wasn't sure what to do with it. So, I sort of implemented Donkey Kong 3 gameplay in first-person. If you take anything away from playing this, it should be that Donkey Kong 3 is an underappreciated vertical shooter.</p>\n\n<p>OUTSIDE 3D ASSETS, MANY MODIFIED SOMEWHAT:</p>\n<ul><li>Bees</li><li>Oil Barrel</li><li>Tables</li><li>TV</li><li>Plants</li><li>Guy with Shades</li></ul>\n<p>OUTSIDE AUDIO,\u00a0MOST MODIFIED:</p>\n<ul><li>Max Headroom live television break-in</li><li>Many sound effects from freesound.org</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-04T04:49:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/320/32072f3bce5a90410ea651ceec0d4fb1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 96, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["whogas"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
