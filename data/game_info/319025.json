Once abundant with enlightened and peaceful beings, this skyward pavilion is now barren and deserted. Exploring this environment introduces\u00a0five distinct areas, each with a colored crystal shard being held by a guardian statue. Collecting all of them could help you discover what happened, if you can reach them all. Each trial challenges your reaction time and precision to scale various forms of heavenly terrain. Will you help Cloak Inquisitor discover the absence of SkyHaven?</p>\n<p>Cloak Inquisitor is an interesting being from the Earthen Bounds, honed in skills of agility and precision. Cloak Inquisitor is able to float slightly within the cloak, allowing its jumps to feel effortless and flow evenly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If success is fated for you and Cloak Inquisitor, then one or more of the select shards can enter your possession. Clearing a trial marks your mastery of its difficulty and importance to SkyHaven.\u00a0 Can you traverse locations like the \"Ancient Shinto Temples\" and claim right over rewards like the \"Crystal of Persistence\"?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Asset Credit:</p>\n<p>Cloak Inquisitor Model - Joshua Churchill</p>\n<p>Skeleton Statue, Statue of Mercury,\u00a0Statue of Nymph Preparing for the Bath-\u00a0oliverlaric</p>\n<p>Cathedral -\u00a0Flyker93</p>\n<p>Japanese Temple -\u00a0spectra7</p>\n<p>Thai Buddha -\u00a0Hannah</p>\n<p>Buddha -\u00a0sun1006</p>\n<p>Japanese Lantern -\u00a0boscorelli3D</p>\n<p>Shrine Gate -\u00a0http://www.3dchaya.com/download_mdl/download00_01.htm</p>\n<p>Low Poly Clouds - 3LE Studios</p>\n<p>Procedural Fire - ERBGAMEART</p>\n<p>Translucent Crystals - SINEVFX</p>\n<p>Standard Assets - Unity Technologies</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-13T05:24:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dec/decc51bbef8b5c6b02696a2b9382265f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joshua Churchill"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
