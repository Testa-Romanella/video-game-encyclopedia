It means theft, it means wasting more supplies, and\u00a0\u00a0it means death. In this fight to keep the human race alive, your goal is to bring as much people and supplies back to the apocalypse shelter as you can! Each member of the party that survives and the supplies are converted to points at the end of the game, and the higher your score, the more likely humanity is to continue to thrive.\u00a0Can you successfully bring a full party back to the shelter? Or will their demands and constant bickering prove to be too much?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-01T14:41:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/713e39472ab40b27c66e40f8382b5611.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silver Monkey Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
