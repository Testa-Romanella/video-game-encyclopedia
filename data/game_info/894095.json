Michele di Piazze wrote in a letter all the symptoms in almost a cold and uncaring way. It was just an objective thing that happened, It couldn't be stopped, and everyone felt hopeless.  The letter ends with \"It lasted for a period of three days and there was no way of preventing its ending in death.\", which helps exemplify the sheer horror of what happened</p>\n\n<p>Analysis:</p>\n<p>The Black death was a terrible event. It killed a lot of people, and it traumatized the survivors. Michele di Piazze was a lot safer from the event than other people, but he still had to witness it take place.  In his letter, he wrote about all the symptoms that happened. It was an incredibly morbid description, and that really\u00a0shows how much the event effected people.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T11:47:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c95/c95e4a40e24b40f704b3425e7fe1b196.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["A_Thor"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
