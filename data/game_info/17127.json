The boomtown is built above a source of valuable crystal resource associated with magic. The resource is called Ember. It is not only of material and scientific value but also a source of dangerous effects on all living organisms.</p>\n<p>Optionally, the player can take third-party quests or visit other dungeon locations, from which he cannot be transferred at any time to the city, unlike traditional positions.</p>\n<p>The game generates each level of the dungeon, collecting together small chunks of the game environment. Each chunk is made by hand and can be used in a variety of rooms. They can contain various events and interactive objects, such as levers that open secret rooms or push bridges to a previously inaccessible site.</p>\n<p>Also, an additional feature is that the player can choose a pet (wolf-dog, ferret or lynx), which will be fully involved in the game, helping the hero in the battles. The pet is equipped and can carry a small amount of stuff.</p>", "metacritic": 83, "released": "2009-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-20T02:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/b17/b175178f8842276b8b18b339fe3146a1.jpg", "website": "http://www.torchlightgame.com", "rating": 3.71, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 191, "owned": 3306, "beaten": 430, "toplay": 53, "dropped": 272, "playing": 17}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 78, "ratings_count": 654, "suggestions_count": 619, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 655, "platforms": ["Xbox 360", "Xbox One", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Runic Games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Microsoft Studios", "Perfect World Entertainment", "JoWooD Entertainment", "Runic Games"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
