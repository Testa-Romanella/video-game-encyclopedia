On every level there are 3 crystals that you might find but you can only take one of them to the end of the stage. Upon opening the portal to the next level the crystal breaks into a few pieces that might be used to open doors on the next one.</p>\n<p>The game includes \"very climatic and epic\" fights, puzzles and platforming (for god knows why). Dying in this game doesn't make you go back to the checkpoint or restarts the game, upon death you get teleported to the start of the game with all of your items (excluding shards and crystals). As we only managed to add a single level the game is only a prototype, a proof of concept, a concept that isn't really showed here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>Space - Jump<br/>Mouse - Looking around<br/>Left mouse button - Attack<br/>Right mouse button - Shoot a fireball<br/>I - Open/Close Inventory<br/>H - Use Health Potion<br/>M - Use Mana Potion<br/>E - Interact<br/>Esc - Menu/Quit Inventory</p>\n<p>Things made by us:<br/>-All of the models (Blender)<br/>-Scripting (Godot)<br/>-Mapping (Godot)<br/>-Animations (Blender)<br/>-All other things I forgot </p>\n<p>Things we gladly took from generous creators:<br/>-Particle Texture (made by Kenney: https://www.kenney.nl/ )<br/>-Font (Special Elite from Google Fonts)</p>\n<p>Things we wanted to add, but didn't have the time to:<br/>-Sounds<br/>-Magic system (mana, more spells)<br/>-More than one level (Working portal to get from one to the other)<br/>-Crystal shards/Crystal altar (The thing with the skulls)<br/>-More puzzles<br/>-The whole theme thing, about how you finished the last thing changes what can you do next<br/>-Polish</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T08:48:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0eb/0eb37a280a9eaaa22588efe12ca75859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["kifner-mateusz"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
