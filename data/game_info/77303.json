The virus is highly aggressive and resembles a flu virus. Avoid groups of people, stay at home and ration your supplies. The government has invoked a state of emergency and mobilized the Army and National Guard. A curfew will be in force starting at dusk.\u201d<br/><br/>Background:<br/>In the late eighties, the US Army researched a substance to optimize the fighting ability of their soldiers. Z1988-N1 (a modified flu virus) was designed to block pain receptors and help soldiers remain battle-ready despite any wounds they might incur. <br/>In addition to blocking pain receptors, one ranger squad experimentally infected with Z1988-N1 remained battle-ready despite the experiment subjects suffering life-threatening injuries. However, injured tissue could not regenerate. The soldiers also became extremely aggressive and lost any and all sense of empathy. After a short while they needed to be isolated as it was impossible to guarantee the safety of those in their surroundings. The test subjects fell physically and mentally into a zombie state, where they would try to eat the uninfected. <br/>Ten days after the start of the experiment the brass attempted to stop it. All infected people were liquidated with a shot to the head and the virus samples were sealed off.<br/>However, something went really wrong two months ago\u2026<br/><br/>Your task:<br/>The virus has spread faster than the government feared. After Z1988-N1 has taken over the east coast, the epidemic spread over the entire planet. Governmental structures have generally failed. <br/>\u2022\tYou are now responsible for the survival of you community. <br/>\u2022\tCreate the necessary infrastructure.<br/>\u2022\tAcquire the essential survival supplies.<br/>\u2022\tDo whatever is necessary\u2026", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:24:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a17/a176b0c428522ade580184226b47a50d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS", "Android"], "developers": ["seal Media"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["sealMedia"], "esrb_rating": null}
