It is a comedic style, action packed shooter game with aspects of the legacy shooter games we grew up on. Yes, we have shields! Yes, we have kill-streaks! Of course we have zombies!  Join your friends in battle or turn on them and blast them at the final moment to get the last kill. It is completely up to you how you play! This game will be built with or without the community. (Although, I would prefer with.) Pick your match to go with or against your friends fighting for survival to be the champion. We are evolving everyday, so be sure to check early access details for more information.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:45:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/903/903af52b31e1232e721e730db5eea933.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 468, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Silent Smack Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Silent Smack Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
