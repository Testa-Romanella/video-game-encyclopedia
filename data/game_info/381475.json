Our main concern was the AI, which we had no experience about. After less than 24 hours we realized that concept would not see the light of day in less than 72 hours, so we took what we had been doing (mapping and character creation) and went through with a soccer game where they use their shells as their main weapon.<br/></p>\n<p>We believe it ended being a very fun local VS experience (that you can play over the internet with applications like [parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/)). You can use the shell to knock your opponent, or you can shoot a very high speed coconut to knock him over! We had great fun with our friends!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Player1: W A S D and Left Shift or Space for using shell spin</p>\n<p>Player2: Arrows and Right Control or NumPad 0 for using shell spin</p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed doing it!</p>\n<p>And if you feel like helping us carry these heavy shells, please consider voting on our project:</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/cocoball</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-11T06:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b4/1b4e5fab114f5d02878e6c3537e80b24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["blitzcloud"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
