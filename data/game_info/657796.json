I had no experience with 2D games and pixel art prior to this, and I'm proud to say that I've learned a lot in the making of this game. One thing I didn't get a chance to learn is music. I wanted to make my own music for this game, but 2D game and pixel art are already a lot to learn, so the time left was too short for me to learn how to make music. Hopefully I have the chance to do that in the next game jam.</p>\n<p>Checkout my devlog at\u00a0https://boonlightgames.com/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T05:09:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba1/ba1bbb6f6f8dcfadeb9b89033e658425.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 63, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["BOON"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
