Hit the ball, cast spells, and move from one beautiful location to another to learn the secret of the undead.</p>\n<p>You play as a student on a magical university cricket team in a fantasy world. After your team's victory in the tournament semi-finals and a rowdy night of celebration, you wake up in the forest. Barely having opened your eyes, you see a crowd of the undead heading straight for you. A crazy situation even for a fantasy world, frankly.</p>\n<p>You have the opportunity to play an advanced Demo version of our game. It's the access to the first seven absolutely playable levels (with finished graphics and tested for bugs) and several cut-scenes that reveal the plot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We would like to thank you for your honest feedback. Participate with us in creating an excellent VR arcade!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T13:43:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cb/6cbcaf5d83a1f251ab233bf7deba7ea5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 494, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["UndeadQuest"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
