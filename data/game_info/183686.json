The night before the jam a member of the team was thinking about possible games for the jam and a mechanic was that the player would get voices that allowed them to perform certain tasks. </p><p>How did you address the themes and keyword of the jam? </p><p>The character uses their voice to interact with the world, it was intended that to perform actions such as jumping and shrink the players character would have to say the action to perform it. Using their voice would allow the character to not only access more of the level but access a better world. </p><p>Gameplay Instructions! </p><p>W or Space - Jump <br/>A/D - Move Left/Right <br/>Scroll Wheel/1-5 Change Skill <br/>Mouse Click - Activate Skill <br/>Shift - Move Faster <br/><br/></p><p>Skill 1 - Spark (not implemented) <br/>Skill 2 - WubWub (not implemented) <br/>Skill 3 - Create Block at mouse location <br/>Skill 4 - Shrink <br/>Skill 5 - Slide (not implemented) </p><p>Origin of Art and Sound Assets All of the art and music in the game was created during the event by team members, a number of sound effects were created during the event for the game as well however they did not make it into the game due to several major functionality bugs which were deemed more important.</p><p>Unfortunately we were unable to implement textures effectively. We were hoping to implement a saturation style colour scheme, as the player progresses through the game the world would become more colourful, as the darkness is slowly defeated.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-09-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1d/d1d4b9e410be2408999577d6bbc22576.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DaDankEngine"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
