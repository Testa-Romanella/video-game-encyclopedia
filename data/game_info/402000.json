And it would have been ... if not for the hordes of snowmen determined to eat your home. There is some hope though, your family runs a dessert and beverage business and just developed a new tool for productivity. With a few tweaks, and a festive paint job, you're now ready to launch high velocity projectiles filled with mulled wine, brandy custard and more. Good luck!</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Showdown at the Candy Cane Lodge</strong>\u00a0is the twelfth chapter in my\u00a0<strong>One day at a time</strong>\u00a0series.\u00a0The series\u00a0was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:</p>\n<ul><li>I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.</li><li>No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.</li><li>Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.</li><li>All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.</li></ul>\n<p>With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order.\u00a0<strong>Showdown at the Candy Cane Lodge</strong>\u00a0is based on the 2019 Global Game Jam theme of \"What home means to you\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-03T02:09:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ae7/ae786adf051863a299c841effa41152a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Iain the Indie"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
