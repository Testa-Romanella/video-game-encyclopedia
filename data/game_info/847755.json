Players enter our world as a Ronin returning to their family. They do return only to see the village conquered by Tainted Warriors and fight to try and carry out the revenge of the slaughtered. However, our Ronin discovers death is truly not the end and that their actions above have consequences below.</p>\n<p>Game Design: Due to the time constraints we decided to make our project primarily focused on combat. We utilized and combined a few different assets in order to implement our core gameplay. The biggest influences for our design was the limited time we had to implement deeper features. This resulted in us scrapping additional mechanics such as magical items, ranged weaponry, loot, stealth and a scoring system. We focused on our teams strengths which included Customized UI/Artwork/music for our games visual aesthetic and presentation. We spent a large portion of time on the creation of a unique map so that we can map out a sequences of events for tutorials, story, and gameplay purposes.</p>\n<p>Gameplay ~ Limited time made us focus on the core elements for implementation including:\u00a0 Sword Combat, assassinations, movement, Enemy AI/Responsiveness, and sequenced story telling.</p>\n<p>Controls/Directions/Instructions</p>\n<ul><li>Movement ~ W, A, S, D</li><li>Attack ~ Left Mouse Button</li><li>Assassinate ~ E</li><li>Dodge ~ Directional Button + Cntrl</li><li>Draw Weapon ~ 1</li></ul>\n\n<p>Assets Used in/for the Project</p>\n<ul><li>Fallen Samurai https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/6bb69eca4a514d36b8bbdee3cb2b...</li><li>Dead Samurai https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/f32aef54cbee48baaa24afcd8074...</li><li>One Hand Sword Attacks And Finishers https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/57300a2f8a974bafb52a134364dc...</li><li>Japanese Modular Temple https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/9e741ef315a84ca590c51ded234f...</li><li>Oni Samurai https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/25ef889e5e9143ecb70c433eaeef...</li><li>Mystic Treasures https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/b10a9b7a72204279818e8a50a3eb...</li><li>Samurai 2 https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/17b28ff3befd40c780470b075a3e...</li><li>Samurai Ronin (Modular) https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/ef138c08f16f44bdb28759000564...</li><li>Japanese Modular Pagoda https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/7f76744917aa4537a2f680658d73...</li><li>Japanese Modular Castle https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/a8dc1b380c8942a6873a83217991...</li><li>Japanese Masks https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/092fde563fe643ebb1ce0e3ff27a...</li><li>Japanese Toro Lanterns https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/de7b120905344d4a8774d4bd9027...</li><li>Samurai Remastered https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/87162f1103114cdeb8f9635a01a5...</li><li>Japanese Modular Village https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/3ff13e849e6147eabc1e16f23399...\u00a0</li><li>Japanese Modular Folk House https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/105575e722784f02a9141ed8b150...\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</li><li>Japanese Shrine &amp; Settlements https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/b61fc06767364d648882f074e74f...</li><li>GhostSamurai_Katana https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ghostsamurai-katana</li><li>Advanced Locomotion System V4\u00a0https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-locomotion-syste...</li><li>Sword FX https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sword-fx</li><li>NIAGARA : Blood VFX Pack https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/niagara-blood-vfx-pack</li><li>Semi-Permanent Blood Droplets https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/semi-permanent-blood-drop...</li><li>M5 VFX RPG1.
