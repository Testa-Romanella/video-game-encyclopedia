The small village becomes a place of mysterious events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nAs the ashter (Slavic sorcerer) who is gifted with the ability to travel in time and knowledge about Navia (the otherworld where human fates shape), following the trail of the unusual fugitive, you come to a mysterious village. Unfortunately, you cannot find anyone there, at least not in a way you expected to. All you can see around are burned hearths.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe game is inspired by Slavic mythology and legends. The story presents the events occurring during the major Slavic festivals in all four seasons far away from each other in time. The gameplay is a mix of exploration and adventure games with unorthodox riddles to solve, but the storyline comes first here.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nPhotogrammetry of ethnographic museums \u2013 To get unique graphics, we visited ethnographic museums. We scanned hundreds of objects and entire buildings, so you can admire them in the game the way they actually are.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nTime travel \u2013 Teleport between four main seasons far away from each other by many years. Get to know the stories of the same heroes at different stages of their lives. Use your power to solve the mystery!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nNon-linear and engaging story \u2013 Experience particular immersive stories at your own pace and at the moment you feel like it.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nConsequences of time manipulation \u2013Set the paths of fate and bring the course of events back on the right track to discover further fragments of the game world and story. Events from the past have an impact on the future.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nSlavic culture \u2013Enjoy not only the immersive story but also look at the long-forgotten everyday activities and objects that are no longer used today.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nExploration and Open World \u2013 Travel between the homesteads and the surroundings of the village, discovering pieces of the mystery that lies somewhere there.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nDynamic environment \u2013The time of day, weather, and lighting change smoothly and dynamically right before your eyes as you discover parts of the mystery.\n\n<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T08:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc8/dc83d0fb3adb5f2b174d9acefc7af0d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 7}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 572, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The End of the Sun Team"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["The End of the Sun Team"], "esrb_rating": null}
