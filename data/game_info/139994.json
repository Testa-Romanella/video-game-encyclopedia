This game is about 10 minutes long, but could get buggy around the halfway mark. You'll notice a lot of inconsistencies in the art (alongside some placeholder images). I'm sorry about that - as it's the first game I've made, I left myself a lot of room to experiment with the visual style. Some of it works, but some of it definitely doesn't! Thanks for being patient and for giving it a shot, warts and all. </p><p>This game was made with guidance from the inimitable Pixelles. The rad chiptune witch jams were a gift from sound fellow Kristian Noel Pedersen.</p><p>Upcoming improvements: </p><p>-make the art more consistent<br/></p><p>-offer more feedback to the player to guide their choices (score thing of sorts, plot and art extras corresponding to the paths they take, etc)</p><p>-oh and finish the story. It's not done!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73e/73eda2fc42b09f8f0dc0087d57ba2d0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["ankylosaurus"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
