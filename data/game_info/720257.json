Suddenly, you hear the objects around you talking out loud. Your family is gone, everyone is gone. You are alone, isolated and locked down surrounded by snowy mountains.</p>\n<p>As you explore the house, you start to understand what has happened. You must listen carefully to what the house itself has to say.\u00a0\u00a0But then everything starts to transform unexpectedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is hard to distinguish dreams from reality. All of the sudden, a place we used to know \u00a0is twisted and warped. As for ourselves, it seems our own body has transformed and adopted unexpected sizes and forms.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Then, all we long for is to find a way out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But who is the one to tell which perspective is real? When do nightmares really end?\r\n</p><p>Credits for the house voice: uberduck.ai</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-10T05:45:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef5/ef5e3492962df9e6e66de73fdded5aa4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["andgilmontana"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
