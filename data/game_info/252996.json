This is a timeless game that still remains challenging. Though seemingly simple enough for children, this engaging game has remained at heart for players of all ages. The goal is to remove all the bubbles from the screen by carefully aiming your own bubble to hit and knock down a group of three or more same colored bubbles. Adjust your winning strategies in each game! The more bubbles you remove in one shot, the more points you score, and the closer you get to becoming the master bubble shooter!</p>\n<p><em>\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, Nederlands, Polski, Portugu\u00eas, \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a, \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, t\u00fcrk\u00e7e, \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e,\u00a0\u00a0</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fa/2fa1f0590904523845b6c7d454d353a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["dizsoft"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
