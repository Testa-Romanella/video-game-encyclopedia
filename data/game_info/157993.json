{"id": 157993, "slug": "pogrom", "name": "Pogrom", "name_original": "Pogrom", "description": "You are a cat seeking revenge on the whole population of a town after another cat was slaughtered there. Your goal is to kill as many living things as you can, but beware that the mice will not just sit down and watch you killing them. Some will even sacrifice their lives to save the ones they love.\r\n<p>The game has 3 difficulty modes and also an upcoming zombie survival mode. Many objects are interactive and by the time you finish killing - you will not recognize the town!</p>\n<p>If you are a fan of retro gaming then you will surely enjoy using the old-school interface system, which is replacing the usual HP bar here.</p>\n\n\n<p>This is my first game ever and to be honest, I have only started learning programming 3 months ago. Any form of feedback is highly appreciated and you are\u00a0welcome in the comments section below.\u00a0</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Ilya \"Ruski\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a88/a883d026cc0da62dcde12e6691e28237.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ruski"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
