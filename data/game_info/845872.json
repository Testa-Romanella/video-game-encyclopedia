{"id": 845872, "slug": "splitdeck-bullet-boss", "name": "Splitdeck - Bullet Boss", "name_original": "Splitdeck - Bullet Boss", "description": "<p>This game prototype\u00a0was created over a few weeks in August of 2022 for the Portland Indie Game Squad (PIGSquad) August Summer Slow Jam. The technical theme was \"boss fight\" and the creative theme was \"dreams &amp; nightmares\"; my personal goal for this jam, regardless of theme, was to create a game which I could play on my Steamdeck.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the Steamdeck allowing end-user\u00a0access to a desktop interface for additional system\u00a0functionality, and despite my inability and lack of understanding for how to export Linux projects from GameMaker, I was still quite easily able to: download and extract\u00a0the windows executable (from this itch page) directly onto my Deck, create a shortcut within Steam to the executable, direct SteamOS to force experimental Proton compatibility, and run the game from within the Deck's standard user interface.</p>\n<p>The following embedded video will detail this installation process:</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Prototype Design Concepts:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Make a basic game which could be played on the Steamdeck.</li><li>Allow for the option of\u00a0a single player using both analog sticks or\u00a0two joint players each using one analog stick; avoid additional\u00a0button inputs to ensure that each player\u00a0can hold\u00a0their side of the deck with comfort and stability.</li><li>Use a singularly strong enemy for the \"boss fight\" theme.</li><li>Divide the playfield in half to incorporate the \"dreams &amp; nightmares\" theme and to\u00a0enforce single-player attention splitting or dual-player\u00a0teamwork.</li><li>End the game with a player(s)\u00a0win if\u00a0both sides of\u00a0the\u00a0boss' split\u00a0health bar is reduced to\u00a0zero; end with a player(s)\u00a0loss by either one of the controllable\u00a0\"characters\" suffering five hits.</li><li>Provide a player movement scheme which feels snappy and responsive in the act of avoiding taking hits; allow for the characters to\u00a0move left and\u00a0right,\u00a0to\u00a0jump, to move while jumping\u00a0(tilt), and \u00a0to\u00a0duck (contract) at any time.</li><li>Do not allow the player characters or their\u00a0respective \"bullets\" to cross the divide --\u00a0avoiding friendly fire.</li><li>Provide the boss with multiple attacks:<ul><li>Continuously fire at slightly randomized intervals\u00a0from two boss \"guns\" which swing back and forth across the divide; these boss bullets, unlike the player characters' bullets,\u00a0can ricochet off the outer walls (screen edges).</li><li>Absorb and return across the divide\u00a0any successfully striking player bullets as an empowered\u00a0boss projectile toward the other player character.</li></ul><ul><li>Watch\u00a0for either player character standing-still for more than a\u00a0second and encourage constant movement by\u00a0firing a directly-aimed and speedier boss bullet at stationary targets.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>The following embedded video will show the gameplay in action while I verbalize my design\u00a0decisions:</p>\n<p><em>*For those who watched the steamdeck\u00a0installation video: while\u00a0the intro and outro of this video does reuse clips, the majority of content in\u00a0this design video\u00a0will not have been seen in the installation video.</em><br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Player Input:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Steamdeck or Controller (if playing the windows build on a PC) required!\r\n<ul><li>Left and Right analog sticks for all player character input.</li></ul><ul><li>Start to restart.</li></ul><ul><li>Select to quit.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Credits:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Created solo by: \u00a0Roh (aka Pete Vellucci Jr)\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Technical Notes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>This prototype was designed and\u00a0programmed for the Steamdeck's default 1280x800 resolution;\u00a0there is no option to fullscreen if playing on a different device/display.</li><li>There is currently no audio.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Designer Notes:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>If you play this, especially if you go through the necessary steps to play this on a Steamdeck, please leave a\u00a0comment on\u00a0if you feel this is worth me\u00a0investing any further development effort; thanks!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T17:43:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e6/7e6bf29d4129b93bdb47484b2c2de257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rohifi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
