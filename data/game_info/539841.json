Chomp your way through tough as teeth enemies and face the dreaded Pearly Knights, a true test of your enam-mettle. Collect upgrades AND diseases to enhance your agility and control over your one and only tooth. Brush and floss daily.<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li>Over 200 upgrades to aid or hinder your run</li><li>Boss fights with multiple phases and attacks to keep you on your gums</li><li>Hundreds of handcrafted rooms and a new body to explore every time you die</li><li>Challenging rewarding skill based combat. No permanent stat upgrades</li><li>4 playable Gummies</li><li>4 game modes that can be mixed and matched to create unique runs</li><li>Customizable difficulty</li><li>More teeth puns then you can shake a tooth brush at</li><li>More fun then going to the dentist</li></ul>\n\n<p>The Pearly Knights wont go down without a fight. Face bosses that will fight tooth and tooth to guard their... little rectangle room... But they love it and it's theirs so beware!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Contract diseases as you play. Diseases are powerful but come at a price. Do you risk the poison of diarrhea for the speed and urgency it creates in you? Leave the disease behind, and the body will consume the disease increasing the difficulty. Take entamaphobia to give all doorways a powerful laser. However, doors now cause damage by going through them. There's a creature that can administer a cure. But where and when you find him is unknown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Use the agility and stickiness of your little gummy to run on walls to escape bullet hells. Initiate slomo to find a path through a maze of bullets. Jump high into the air to get a better view or to dodge an impossible amount of bullets. While your in the air, why not take the time to reflect on your life. The purchase you just made....WAIT! That enemy is stunned! JUMP ON IT!!! As a kid, did you ever try to re-insert your baby tooth back into its gummy cavity? No? Well now's your chance! Shoot your tooth and suck back! Time it just right to inflict extra damage.<br/><br/><br/>Do you hate rogue-lites? There's options to make the game more forgiving! Want to start the game with a bunch of health? Want to give yourself a little power boost??\u00a0 Want to unlock all the items???\u00a0There's more subtle options that no one will notice if you use. This wont block off content though. You play how you want.</p>\r\nEarly Access\r\n<p>Cavity Busters is currently in early access. We do weekly/biweekly updates, depending on the goal of the update. (Update history on Steam) So there may be a small delay between updates due to being available on more than one platform. That being said, Cavity Busters is a complete experience. You can play from start to finish with 4 different players, over 200 upgrades and 4 different game modes with more to come!</p>\r\nA note to potential buyers\r\n<p>At first glance, Cavity Busters looks like an Enter the Gungeon or Binding of Isaac clone. While both are huge inspirations, Cavity Busters plays much different.\u00a0The game has some unique mechanics. If you'd like something new in the genre, I believe you'll have a deep, rewarding experience!</p>\r\nFollow the game at these places\r\n<p>Dev Twitter: https://twitter.com/SpaceMyFriend</p>\n<p>Cavity Busters Twitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/Cavity_Busters</p>\n<p>Cavity Busters Discord:\u00a0discord.gg/9n55pyy</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-04T05:50:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41a/41aba92df7b92a1d5baa5075301bd8ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 243, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpaceMyFriend"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
