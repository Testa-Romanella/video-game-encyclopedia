We're seeking feedback on the current state of the game, especially on the puzzles and how clear it is to you what your goal is and how to achieve it from one puzzle to the next.</p>\n<p>The game is still fairly buggy at the moment, but none of the bugs should make the game impossible to play. However, there are a number of additional bugs in the browser version. The endings do not work properly at the moment when playing in the browser. Normally, the game is supposed to close when you reach an ending, but instead it will display incorrect dialog and never end. Additionally, it seems that you cannot open the pause menu or inventory in the browser version.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T05:24:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f1/6f1323aa40645f39600e566f152d244e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["EmptyHouse"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
