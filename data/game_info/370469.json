During operation, the Nanobot has been digested by a so called Supercell, and is now trapped inside together with an armada of blue and orange colored Organells.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the Supercell behaves agressively and parasitic, doing harm to the Patient's body. It can only be stopped by destruction, so the body can recover.</p>\n<p>Your Nanobot is threatened by the cell's metabolism, so your aim is to breakout soonly before being disrupted by the environment.<br/><br/>(!) Notes: <br/>The game took more than 3 hours to make (about 6 so far).<br/>It's still incomplete, first level not finished - will be continued on Monday, Sept. 2.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-02T05:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdc/cdc3ac09b6004186a65b3c18abd75859.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["koppercraft"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
