Three artifacts have been scattered across\u00a0the land. Find them and return them to the obelisk where they belong to bring magic back to the environment.</p>\n<p>Reviver was made in one weekend at the USC Games chapter of Global Game Jam 2021. Its original soundtrack, beautiful pixel art, and simple crafting system\u00a0complement the exploration-oriented area design. Although Reviver has some bugs and incompleteness, it demonstrates the ability of its development team to create a strong vertical slice in only one weekend.</p>\n<p>Team: Camilo Quintero, Courtney Taylor, Dresden Kershaw, Janay Maisano, Kobi Saha</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T05:17:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c7/7c7b7e3475e09d85c6094ad50c9b986a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kobi Saha"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
