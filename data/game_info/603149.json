Since people have been stuck inside I figured what better way to release some pent up anger or energy than to destroy some nasty viruses and bacteria! This game is a 2D shooter that allows the user to control a character (bandage) and shoot at incoming waves of viruses. The user can take damage and will lose lives if they let viruses past them. After 5 lives are lost or the user takes enough damage the game ends. The goal is to try and see how high you can get on rounds. Good luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-14T07:48:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cdb/cdbc85c934e0b107daf2a6461ec21063.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GabeKeener"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
