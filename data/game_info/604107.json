{"id": 604107, "slug": "spirit-becoming", "name": "Spirit Becoming", "name_original": "Spirit Becoming", "description": "Your choices affect how the story progresses. Will you choose the right path and get the best ending to this story?<br/><br/>As a young Hmong man, you awaken alone in the middle of a beautiful meadow. When faced with harrowing decisions, will you choose the option that will lead you to your ultimate goal? Muster up your courage and take this adventure for a spin! Your story is waiting to unfold as you interact with the land and people who inhabit this world. Navigate through a mysterious and unknown, yet seemingly familiar, land using only your wits! <br/><br/>The sights you see, both in the game and through your own imagination, will send a sense of nostalgia through you as well as excite you about the Hmong culture! Loosely based on and inspired by various stories, folklore, and fairy tales told through generations upon generations of Hmong families, Spirit Becoming is one half re-telling and one half fantasty-inspired original creation meant to cast a light on one of the central yet often unspoken journeys taken by a small and special group of the Hmong people. <br/><br/>Spirit Becoming is by no means a historical documentation of the journey taken by the spiritual leaders of the Hmong community, but hopes to honor such experiences by helping those who may or may not be aware learn about a journey that leads many to a lifelong career of healing and guidance for an entire population.<br/><br/>----------------<br/><br/>NOTE:<br/>We welcome any feedback during your experience!
