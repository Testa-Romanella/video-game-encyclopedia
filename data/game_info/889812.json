(Phil Johnson)", "description": "<p>Brad Foreman is a high school junior whose hair wasn't necessarily out of date at the time, and he sure does enjoy punching people. More specifically, he enjoys punching people who he believes to be a threat to the safety of himself or others in general. His most treasured personal pastime is cleaning up the streets of his hometown the only way he knows how: with a big smile and a certain method of physical violence which is, hopefully, incredibly obvious by this point. Join Brad on a short, simplistic beat 'em up adventure, and press that punch button as many times as you see fit!\r\n</p>\n<p>This project is a particularly special one to me. Beat 'em ups have always been my favorite genre of video game and I've always wanted to make one, so releasing this game is a big personal milestone for me! There's certainly lots that can be improved upon or developed in this game, but I'm almost certain this will not be the last time I try my hand at the genre! For this project especially, if you have any suggestions, ideas, or thoughts in general, please leave them in the comments! And of course, thank you for playing! <br/></p>\n<p>Music by Jesse Spillane:</p>\n<ul><li>Meatball</li><li>Wiggly Air Wall</li><li>Clown Car Unlimited</li><li>Green Monster</li></ul>\n<p>Music licensed under CC BY 4.0.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T21:17:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/216/216b8045e7ac2de5681e02fe1b21c0f1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Phil Johnson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
