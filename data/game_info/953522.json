That is the only way I can describe it.</p>\n<p>172 passages and 156 drawings made.</p>\n<p>Please tell me if there are any problems.</p>\n<p>The drawings were made after the game was made. Many drawings were made out of order (I worked on the title screen after the around 6 pictures were already made).\u00a0I had no idea what the character would be so I\u00a0made up something quickly.
