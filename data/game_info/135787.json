Not every person you encounter will be hostile many are just lost and are looking for someone to follow, recruit these people to join you and with them unlock new jobs for your followers to do, but be careful the more followers the more food is needed. Your followers will also need to rest on occasion and you will need to set up camp so they are able to sleep and get back to their assigned job.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>This was a small part-time project that I worked on in the evenings over a couple of months it is short and nothing special. I am not going to be working on it any more and decided to put it up to get a game from idea to release.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e64/e64e007f91adcfb70ffc9c8cf9925888.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ben Freeman"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
