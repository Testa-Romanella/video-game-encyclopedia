The goal of this simulation is to enclose the user in a room where the walls are covered in holes so that the user can become accustomed to seeing clusters of holes in a safe, controlled environment.\r\n  </p>\r\nDescription of the application\r\n<p>Interface of this application is an immersive experience using Virtual Reality technology, this is so it is done in a humanlike, 3D spatial way that completely immerses the user. Application of this theory has the user exist in a virtual environment with four switches representing the level. The first switch is a stop switch so that if the user becomes too overwhelmed, they can control their ending of the therapy. After this, three switches control the difficulty level, differences between the difficulty levels are of the amount and size of the holes e.g., level I has few large holes, level II has medium holes in both size and number, and level III has many smaller holes.\r\n  </p>\n<p>For this the interface problem is isolating the phobia in a safe and controlled environment. Software used is a computer run application that will work through a full sensory immersion interface that the user can walk, interact, and control. Studies have shown that virtual reality exposure therapy is highly effective for when used for many kinds of traumatic experiences, so as virtual reality is proven to be an effective interface, it has been repurposing to fit the chosen phobia (Vianez, Marques and Sim\u00f5es de Almeida, 2022).\r\n  </p>\r\nInteraction Design\r\n<p>Interaction within the application is very important to give the user a sense of control, as the user is already in an anxiety inducing environment it can cause further damage by removing the user\u2019s ability to self-monitor and control their own anxiety within the environment (Peterson, 2015).\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n  </p>\r\nTechnical development\r\n<p>As discussed with Lindsey the submission of this application is a Windows file that uses a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to run. This is due to issues in acquiring and oculus. WASD keys are used to move and to interact with the buttons a block that can be seen through a player\u2019s view and is connected to the character will trigger the level reactions when colliding with the button blocks.\r\n  </p>\r\nDescriptions of 3D Models\r\n<p>all 3D models for this application were designed by Darius Rosa-Denham in blender. These models are of the room levels, ranging from the main room with no holes, to level I room having large holes, level II room having medium holes and level III having small holes. The buttons are simple object cubes created in Unity.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p><p>Main room</p><p>Level 1 room</p><p>Level 2 room</p><p>Level 3 room\r\n  </p>\r\nReferences\u00a0\n<p>Peterson, T., 2015.\u00a0Anxiety and Your Sense of Control | HealthyPlace.
