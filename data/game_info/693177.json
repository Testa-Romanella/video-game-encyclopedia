You\u00a0will have multiple routes to choose from as your character consistently moves forward. The goal is to collect stars that increase your speed as you make your way to the end of the level. You will need to time your jumps and actions in order to effectively collect all stars in each level. If you miss a star your speed is slightly reduced but it cannot go below a set threshold in order to continue game flow.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<ul><li>Throw Hands Up - Jump</li><li>Throw Hand Down - Slide</li><li>Left Internal Trigger - Switch Lane Left</li><li>RIght Internal Trigger - Switch Lane Right</li><li>Hold Thumbstick in direction of wall run point after jump - Wall Run</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-12T07:04:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd5/dd5933f8de49d8963783ee87b4ee5853.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Callum Nottage"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
