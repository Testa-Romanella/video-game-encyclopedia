I wanted to complete a project. So I picked up a bite-sized project to make a 10-level ball-bouncing game. I took a couple Saturdays and put it all together, then polished it up.</p>\n<p>I consdier this project complete. There's some weird rendering bug that flickers lines on the screen occasionally, and level 10 did not turn out as well as I'd hoped for the final level, but\u00a0I have a lot of fun going back and playing this every now and then. I hope you do too!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-13T04:37:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2ecc77c9d0cbedfed23aa14675d4c7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Craziac"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
