Got going way too late but happy with the results. Not really much of a roguelike, besides the waiting and turn based movement, but I kinda like the name.\r\n  </p>\n<p>You are an animated rock/paper/scissors and must survive waves enemies. It's a turn based game where everything moves at once. You change between rock, paper, and scissors to counter the enemies in the room. Use strategy to stay alive and try to get a high score.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>W, A, S, D: </strong>Shifts between forms\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Arrow keys: </strong>Moves your character\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Spacebar: </strong>Waits a turn\r\n  </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T03:27:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/48b/48bf7d293e9230a08b8e2e2eb031cbd5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aran"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
