A game jam was organised with the theme : Reinvent the classics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is our submission. We decided to create a infinite runner and adding a kinda new gameplay to it.</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to go through doors of the same color of the cube. Each time the cube pass successfully a door, it changes his color randomly. Items do not work for now but will be added later.</p>\n<p>NB : The game is in french language but it should be easy to start the game and play it. A translation will be added later.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:40:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e62/e623ff9426820708e7c287dcf97855d2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jubileus Deus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
