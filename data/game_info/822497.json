There's a twist though.... Every turn, all characters must reroll their stats! Defeat the gobbies and save the day!<br/>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse</p>\n<p>Pause: Esc/P</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>The active character during a turn will be highlighted.<br/></p>\n<p>At the start of each character's action, you reassign the stats for each character using dice. These stats will rill remain until the next turn. Different characters will have access to different sets of dice.<br/></p>\n<p>Click on the arrow to bring up that character's stat sheet. You can click and drag to connect the nodes together to assign the dice rolls to the character's stats. You may notice a special \"ADD\" card.</p>\n<br/>This card will allow you to combine the scores of 2 dice together to add them towards one stat!<br/>\n<p>Once you are done, click \"Finalize Stats\" at the bottom of the window to finalize your stats.</p>\n<p>Then you move and attack.</p>\r\nMeet the Characters\r\n\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>Knight</strong> is a jack of all trades, boasting balanced stats. She makes an apt frontline fighter, but be careful not to push her too hard.</p>\n\n<br/>The <strong>Medic</strong> is a gentle soul. They have access to a unique ability \u2014at the end of their turn, they can heal their allies that are nearby. This healing ability scales inversely with his attack stat; the greater his attack, the less he heals. So be careful when using him for offense! Those who spend too much time taking life will struggle to save it.<br/><br/><br/>Even machine life will participate in the battle for humanity! The <strong>Robot</strong> is a real beefcake! It has tremendous HP, defense, and attack. Thanks to its special beam cannon, it can also attack both adjacent enemies and enemies 1 tile away! However, all that firepower comes at the cost of mobility. Be sure to invest in its movement if you want it to get anywhere.<br/><br/><br/>The <strong>Rogue</strong> is a master of mischief! He has great initiative and movement. He also has unique access to a special kind of die \u2014 the D20! This grants him a lot of variability, allowing him to make one of his stats excel for a turn. This comes at a cost; many of his other stats are comparatively low. Be careful not to over-extend!<br/><br/><br/>The last of our heroes is the <strong>Witch!</strong> She's a glass-cannon through and through: high attack but frail defense. Her techno-magic allows her to attack from a distance, up to 1 tile away.<br/>\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n<p>The bridge tiles do not get highlighted properly. This is most apparent in the level titled \"Beginning - An End\"</p>\n<p>Hovering over a character will only show base stats and will not account for stats assigned by dice.<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Bread - Programming</p>\n<p>BgAlex - Character &amp; Map Design, Balance, 3D Renders<br/></p>\n<p>Mr. Solo - Pixel Art</p>\n<p>Erhan.jpg - Music, SFX, Character Design\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T16:32:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fde/fde1c9daf0b9107466414ae1f1fb1927.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["bread", "BgAlex", "Mr Solo", "erhan.jpg"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
