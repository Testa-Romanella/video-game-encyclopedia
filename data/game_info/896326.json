Work together with the other player to maximize the energy saved or compete against them to see who can get the most points.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Dodge obstacles, bounce on the other player, and go as fast as you can to light up the city with the energy you save.\u201d\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Bumper Boats is a fast paced, single player and two-player co-op endless runner designed for ages 10-12 years old. The game takes inspiration from games like Subway Surfer and Temple Run.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\r\n There were a lot of takeaways from this project that we will bring with us to our next projects.\r\n Especially for short projects like this, we found that it is very important to make the important decisions for the game at an early stage. For example, making a style guide for the art team, designing the core gameplay, and the mood of the game. This will ensure that the important parts of the game get made as soon as possible and gives everyone a clearer direction and view of the current status of the project.<br/></p><p>Developed by Team 05 as part of Game Project 1.<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T20:41:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c045145caed074e0389718b99c0a99d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
