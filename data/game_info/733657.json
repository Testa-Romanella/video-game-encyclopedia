This has been my focus for most of the project and I will continue to improve it until I'm satisfied the game feels more like an action game and not just platforming.</p><p>Beyond that the plan is to control multiple character throughout a level and different routes each can take. Each route grants a bonus that improves the character's abilities and open up routes within other levels.</p><p><strong>Thanks:</strong><br/></p><p>Music by Garret Rose</p><p>I appreciate everyone reviewing and leaving comments on the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T07:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af4/af4592d8947fca8e12998e581ddc8387.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["FanManPro"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
