A revolutionary game about making games, it\u00a0aims to make game design accessible to anyone and everyone. Balancing a meta plot about a struggling game designer, pressured from society at all sides, with fun and interactive mechanics allowing you to design your own games, this game is a true once in a generation experience.\u00a0It is both easy to learn and complex enough to build any kind of game imaginable. It has both the capabilities to make a masterpiece on the level of Sneak King, the greatest game of all time, as well a shitpost for April Fools day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Armed with nothing more than this, you too can finally create the game of your dreams!</p>\n<p>Don't believe me?\u00a0See what my playtesters had to say about it:</p>\n<ul><li>\"A true work of art. 5 Games out of 4.
