Their job is to make sure Fringe Zone explorers and researchers keep out of trouble. Usually, it's a pretty easy-going job of hanging around with interesting people, having parties and fending off a few Nasty Boys with non-lethal stun guns, but things quickly take a more serious turn when another Flexbot unit goes missing\u2026<br/><br/><h3>Hardcore 2 player retro shooter at heart </h3><br/>Taking inspiration from classics old and new, while adding some spice of its own, Children of the Eclipse's core gameplay is the definition of easy to play, hard to master.
