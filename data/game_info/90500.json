The production time of the game was 9 weeks with everything produced except sound and music.<br/><br/>The game also supports VR interaction but it is restricted just to walking around in the level. Supported VR is SteamVR (Vive) but also works using SteamVR emulators with a smartphone.<br/><br/>I really hope you will enjoy this short game and would love to hear any kind of feedback!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/> WASD - movement (walk front, left, back, right)<br/> Mouse movement - Rotate camera / look around<br/> Mouse left click - Interact and open doors<br/> Mouse right click - Hold to zoom<br/> E - Activate / pickup<br/> F - Toggle flashlight on / off<br/>Escape or M - open in-game pause-menu</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-22T13:30:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b98/b987d2d7bbba9aa3c39c5d776e191a12.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 247, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Micaka"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
