It uses only 2 sprites - a white square and a white circle and a custom invert shader. The graphics are intentionally spartan due to the nature of this game jam, but we tried to make it visually appealing anyways and to find creativity in those restrictions.</p><p><strong>credits</strong><br/></p><p>All music in monochrome is by Kevin MacLeod</p><p>Cyborg Ninja Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p><p>Kick Shock Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p><p>\"Mega Hyper Ultrastorm\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p><p>Font: iPixelU</p><p>http://www.dafont.com/i-pixel-u.font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/319/319874c2071266213f2000185d028f32.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 4, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["morphinegames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
