I've mostly focus on implementing new mechanics rather than having astonishing graphics. This game was simply a way to challenge me into making something bigger than what I usually go for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please if you have time, leave a comment and give me your absolute honest opinion. Even if it is harsh I would always value honesty over my own well-being and self-esteem. If it is not too much to ask you consider also tipping me 2.00$ as it would really encourage me to keep my effort and it would be my first step as a professional game developper.</p>\n\n<p>Enjoy, Altoo.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T13:27:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64b/64b6c5e3a0f776e4eaa3def1f365ede1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Altoo"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
