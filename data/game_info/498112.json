The users can interact with the game through a series of interfaces that change how the game operates. There are sliders to decide the color, Buttons to change shape and clear canvas (destroy all), and a toggle to decide if the user wants their paint objects to stay. There is also a mouse position indicator in the top right corner of the screen to indicate to the user exactly where their mouse is positioned.\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T02:33:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/afb/afb39b9cfa3b527f3f9a5b497aed8804.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MarcusNW"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
