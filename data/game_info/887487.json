Can you make it to its lair and end its reign?</em></p>\n<p><em>Eye of the Beatholder</em> is a <strong>One Button Rythm Roguelite</strong>, heavily inspired by <em>Crypt of the Necrodancer</em>. Press the Spacebar on <strong>odd beats</strong> to move forward or attack enemies in front of you. Press the Spacebar on <strong>even beats</strong> to rotate your character to the right. The final boss is actually pretty tough, so make sure to collect some damage upgrades before fighting him.</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing and have fun!</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-28T11:41:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c385e19226c7e97213aaa463fbb6d791.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Tianmaru"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
