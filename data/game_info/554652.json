Now he is dead and, as the person closest to him, you must perform his Ash Carrying. Return to the island you both grew up on, speak to three people who knew him when he was young, and travel to the highest point on the island to scatter his ashes to the wind.

Would you rather not know what he didn't want you to know?</p>\n<p>Ash Carrying is a short-ish Twine story\u00a0about death, mourning, cultural traditions, and the relationship between storytelling, love, and identity.
