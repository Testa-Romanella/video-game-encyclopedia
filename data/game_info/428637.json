As you get to know her, she'll happily fool around with you and send you fun little pictures.<h3>Mobile Interface</h3><br/>Everything in Rosas are Red is made to look like a phone. You'll find yourself right at home as if you were on your own real-world phone. Whether you're messing with the settings or looking in your gallery to see the nice pictures that Rosa sends you, it'll all look like you're really on your phone.<h3>Wholesome Pictures</h3><br/>As you play through the game and make the right choices, Rosa will reward you with lots of lewd pictures that you probably shouldn't show your family. You'll be able to review these pictures as they get saved to your gallery. Happy zooming!<h3>Episodic Content</h3>Rosa's story will be told in episodic chunks as development continues. Each chapter will have its own arc and will lead smoothly into the next.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T03:51:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/537/537bbf700a5ab4c18487280fd15e0d3f.jpg", "website": "https://anduogames.wordpress.com/rosas-are-red/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anduo Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Anduo Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
