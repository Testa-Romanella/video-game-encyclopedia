{"id": 476728, "slug": "fenris-manor", "name": "Fenris Manor", "name_original": "Fenris Manor", "description": "Fenris Manor\r\n<p>Fenris Manor is a game heavily influenced by Castlevania 1-4. These games were a large part of my childhood and continued to influence my adult life. The game will tell the story of Izabell Solis as she fights her way through the manor of the Werewolf King, Fenris. Izabell has been tasked with purging the land of the evils that reside within the manor and protecting the nearby village. The manor is home to not only the Werewolf King but also home to many other frightening creatures.</p>\n<p>There are currently 6 stages planned for the full game, though more may be added as goals are met. Each stage will have 1 boss and several enemies unique to it, and there will be enemies shared among stages. A pair of enemies for the first stage has been implemented and will be the main adversaries of version 0.1</p>\n<p>As more enemies and features are completed I will update this post.
