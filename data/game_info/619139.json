{"id": 619139, "slug": "blob-exchange", "name": "Blob Exchange", "name_original": "Blob Exchange", "description": "<p>My submission for GMTK Game\u00a0Jam 2021. This is my first time being in a game jam, as well as my first time actually making a game although I have spent time tinkering. This has been incredibly stressful. I almost thought\u00a0 wouldn't make it on time! But hey, at least I produced something playable.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>-Left click a Blob to select it.<br/>-Left click an empty spot (each square has room for two blobs) to move a selected Blob to that spot.<br/>-Right click a Blob to join it with a Blob in the same square.<br/>-Right click a joined Blob to separate them again.</p><p>Inactive Blob (Grey):</p><p>-Cannot move but can be joined by an Active Blob.<br/>-Becomes an Active Blob\u00a0(White) when\u00a0<em>one</em> of its color values exceeds its maximum value.<br/></p><p>Active Blob (White):</p><p>-Can only move or join another Blob.<br/>-Cannot affect the values of other Blobs while separated.<br/></p><p>Joined Blobs:<br/></p><p>-Cannot move, but can be separated.<br/>-Joined Blobs will permanently increase the color value of the other Blob by a portion of its own color values.<br/>-Joined Blobs will \"broadcast\" their color values to Blobs in adjacent squares. This will temporarily increase their color values by a little bit, but only while the Blobs stay joined.<br/></p><p>Color Values:</p><p>-Each Blob has different starting color values, and different maximum values.<br/>-Joined Blobs permanently enhance each other's color values.<br/>-If its color value reaches its maximum, it cannot be further increased this way.<br/>-A Blob can also receive temporary boosts to their color values from adjacent Joined Blobs.<br/>-A Blob can continue to gain boosts to its color value this way, even beyond its maximum.</p><p>How To Win:<br/></p><p>-Somewhere on the Grid is a special color panel.<br/>-The total color value of the Blob(s) on that panel must equal or exceed the value listed on that panel. You may have to move a Blob away to see the number.<br/>-Once all special color panels have Blobs that have their corresponding color values exceed that number, the game ends.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T13:31:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/329/329a24c36806b837e3239ddd6adf058a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Manock"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
