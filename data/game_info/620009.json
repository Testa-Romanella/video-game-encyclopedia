Some klutz at the tetromino factory dropped a vat of sticky goo on all the pieces, and its your job to clean up the mess. As we all know, the only way to get rid of tetrominos is to push them into straight lines, so get to work! <br/><br/>Controls: Arrow keys to move, R to restart <br/><br/>Objective: Clear as many blocks as you can by pushing the pieces into straight lines, horizontal or vertical. Any tetrominos that touch will become joined together, and the only way to separate them is to clear a line between them. More tetrominos spawn when you take a certain number of steps, as indicated by the bar on the right. Game ends when at least half of the screen is filled with tetrominos.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T17:03:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c93/c93d54fb6e797291989c07576910e355.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["borkle"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
