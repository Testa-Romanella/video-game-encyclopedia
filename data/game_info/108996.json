We participated in a competition at school and came in first at our school and second in the entire country!\u00a0The game was designed and thought out in 3 weeks and programmed and made in 3 days. The goal was to make a fully functional product withing the short time that was given.</p>\n<p>Since I was the team manager I participated in helping with assets programming and level design. The rest of the team had specifik jobs and focused on their own projects.</p>\n<p>The competition was a lot of fun and I would love to participate again sometime.</p>\n\n<p>The game is only playable with Oculus with controllers or with a HTC vive with controllers.</p>\n<p>The triggers need to be pushed and you need to wave your arms to move forward.</p>\n<p>The grip buttons function als grabbing</p>\n<p>You can climb highlighted objects and can push crates.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5b/a5b4941beb0c02330995236bf6956e17.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robon Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
