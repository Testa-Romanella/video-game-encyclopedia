One fateful day the spark of life strikes and the figure awakens! Now is your time to start the adventure and escape!<br/>\r\nYour journey will take you far. You will uncover great mysteries and discover what has long been forgotten. But \u2013 after all is done and the day grows short \u2013 will you have found a place to call home?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is a non-violent game. There is no killing, there are no deathtraps.<br/>\r\nInstead the challenge comes from learning new game mechanics, crisp platforming, puzzles, and of course level exploration. Living Art is not an easy game, but it is fair. New mechanics are always introduced gradually, and the difficulty curve is a steady climb.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nLiving Art consists of 4 main acts and a closing act, each varies drastically in setting, gameplay, and feel. The main acts are each split into 3 levels, and each features a bonus level (unlocked by 100% completing the act's main levels).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAlthough Living Art takes place in our shared universe, it is a standalone experience and can be enjoyed as such.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-19T03:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d39/d39a1ec81b43dfd5829c4b06cf7dd727.jpg", "website": "http://www.sharadise.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Sharadise"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sharadise"], "esrb_rating": null}
