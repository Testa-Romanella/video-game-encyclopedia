It works with mouse/keyboard, but it has been designed for analog stick/trigger controllers.</p>\n<p>TORB is a very old project that we have been playing with on and off for almost 6 years. We dusted it off for the FFS Jam because we knew it was special, but never quite got the shine and polish it deserved.\u00a0Though a complete (and we think, pretty sweet!) game unto itself,\u00a0 we wanted to give players access to more options than we had time to add in-game. So we've put an <strong>.ini file</strong> next to the .exe\u00a0with some deeper options for the game\u00a0:</p>\n<p>- Hide UI</p>\n<p>- Control Rumble Strength - Xbox One controllers are much newer than our game's engine version, so they behave a bit strangely. In particular, some\u00a0have unusually strong rumble in TORB. Lower this value if it's too nuts.</p>\n<p>- Music Volume - Did you know our music is dynamic? As AI enemies spawn, their theme mixes fluidly with the other enemies' themes, forming a SYMPHONY OF DEATH.</p>\n<p>- Gravity Scale - This can get nuts, but go for it.</p>\n<p>- Shield Recharge Time - Turning this down really changes the game.</p>\n<p>- Total Bops to win Free For All - Changes the target number of bops needed to win a TORBmatch when its every TORB for itself.</p>\n<p>- Total Bops to win Free For All - Changes the target number of bops needed to win a TORBmatch when its TeamTORBs time. There I said it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:</strong></p>\n<p>- KNOWN UNKNOWNS - TORB is an old project with lots of experimenting and tinkering under its hood. When you make a game about a crystal dimension of infinite, unique\u00a0sword battles, you pay for it with some mysteries.\u00a0 To be honest, we don't really know all the\u00a0crazy stuff that can\u00a0happen in TORB.\u00a0Its never lived out in the wild, so be prepared for some unpredictable things. Its a weird little game, but it loves to be played and its can always surprise you!</p>\n<p>- STARTUP - Its so weird how it takes so long to get to that unity splash screen. Sorry.</p>\n<p>- WEAPONS - The game is currently balanced for the main weapon, the CRYSTAL BLADE! However, you can try out some alternate weapons we have made over the years in SANDBOX mode. THESE WEAPONS ARE NOT AT ALL BALANCED AGAINST EACH OTHER.</p>\n<p>- WAVES - That map is big, but it was made in less than a month, so sometimes enemies get stuck in strange crevasses! This is lousy because then you can't end the wave and you have to restart. Sorry, it bothers us too.</p>\n<p>- WAVES - Sometimes a buddy gets stuck on a wall. If you've played waves, YOU'LL KNOW WHO WE MEAN. Use your grapple to un-stick them.</p>\n<p>- WAVES (sigh) - Sometimes the gates are a bit hard to open. They are completely physical contraptions so they can be a bit unpredictable.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong><br/></p>\n<p>TORB created by Adrian Lopez-Mobilia and Jason Rosenstock</p>\n<p>Music by Gabe Lopez-Mobilia</p>\n<p>Massive 'THANK YOU' to everyone who\u00a0 encouraged us to keep working on TORB.
