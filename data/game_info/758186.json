Shoot.</p>\n<p>Now you have to stay outside locked out until a locksmith can get there in two weeks.\r\n</p>\n<p>Let's just hope the robots didn't follow you home...\r\n</p>\n<p>(Spoiler alert, they do. And you end up remembering you had a key under your doormat after a week...)\r\n</p>\n<p>If you get any visitors while you stay out, you only have your flashlight at your disposal. Don't let Boxy break inside or it's his house.\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>This game was made in like 2 days, so the LOOOORE isn't ideal. But the game doesn't seem to have bugs from my testing. If you find any, feel free to let me know. This is the last game I'm making so I wanted to make it slightly different from other fangames. And the game can be pretty confusing for the first few nights, but you get used to it eventually. The game is designed for you to try to figure out what you do, to avoid dying, it shouldn't be too tough to figure out. And use your flashlight wisely, if you hear breathing, do NOT use it.\r\n</p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Textures: https://3djungle.net/\r\n</p>\n<p>Audio: https://freesound.org/\r\n</p>\n<strong><em>Character Models: \r\n</em></strong>\r\n@JellyJake112\u00a0\r\n<em>Room Models, game design, and coding: \r\n</em>\r\n@reda19199\u00a0\r\n<p>More detailed credits are in the \"Credits\" menu.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-21T12:49:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7c6/7c661e4b960f7ffb98fd8ef44fbfa1fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SuperStarGamerR"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
