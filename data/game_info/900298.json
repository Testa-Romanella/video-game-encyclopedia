When one dies, you lose control of it and start moving the other. But be quick and get them both to safety, because a killer RoboBird is relentlessly hunting you!</p>\n<p>Get your two RoboChicken to their safe nest through challenging terrain, all while a speedrun timer is ticking! When finishing, replaying to beat your time is recommended!</p>\n\n<p>This Game was made in three days for the Mini Jam. The limitation was \"losing is good\", and in this game you have to die with one bird in order to move the other forward. The optional theme was \"intermission\", its implementation is a bit loose here, but you get an intermission from moving one character when it dies.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Sound Effects &amp; Music:</p>\n<p>- https://leohpaz.itch.io/minifantasy-dungeon-sfx-pack</p>\n<p>- https://kenney.nl/assets/interface-sounds<br/></p>\n<p>Font:</p>\n<p>https://tinyworlds.itch.io/free-pixel-font-thaleah<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-26T05:54:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cea/cea79c4c4776918e649406a2ff4b4a90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["dardasaba"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
