BCM is primarily a story about family bonds across time and involves time travel, tracking down a serial killer, and potential gay romance. It is plot-heavy rather than romance-heavy and can be classified as slice of life, boys' love, and science fiction. We give the game a 15+ rating due to violent/horrific imagery and writing.</p>\n<p>\tBCM was released on December 16, 2015 for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The game retails for $19.99. The demo covers the first 2 chapters out of 5. <strong>Note:</strong> every purchase of the game through itch.io comes with a Steam key to obtain a copy of the game on Steam.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.3 was uploaded on march 30, 2016.</strong> This update addresses a few minor cosmetic bugs, such as the sprites not transitioning correctly when text speed was set to max. The demo was also updated to version 1.2, which makes the same fixes.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.2 was uploaded on February 9, 2016. </strong>This includes some typo fixes and a fix to make the neutral ending easier to obtain. Version 1.1 of the demo was also uploaded, which contains some cosmetic and typo fixes.</p>\n<p><strong>Version 1.1 was uploaded on January 7, 2016. </strong>This includes a few minor cosmetic fixes to the gallery and sprites, a few typo fixes, and a fix that allows for conversations with both of Yukinari's brothers to pass a route check (due to a bug, only talking to one specific brother worked previously) in chapter 4.</p>\n<p>Also, a comprehensive guide is now available to everyone who purchases the game.

His parents blamed her death on the negligence of their eldest son, Natsume. The Amamiya family was never the same.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t One fateful morning, Shuuki stumbles across the gruesome sight of his brother Masaharu's corpse. When all hope is lost and Shuuki must come to terms with the fact that his brother has been murdered, the mysterious Kyousuke appears before him with a proposition:</p>\n<p> <em>\"Do you want to bring your brother back? </em><em>To fix your family's broken relationship? You can\u2026if you learn to travel through time.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\tBefore he knows it, Shuuki is caught in a plot far more sinister than he could have ever imagined. He learns that the key to traveling through time and stopping innocents from being killed lies in mementos: items that are a link between the past, future, and present. \t<br/>\n</p>\n<p> <strong>Trigger &amp; Content Warnings:</strong> verbal and physical abuse, implied sex, slurs related to gender/sexual identity, blood/gore, murder, violence, student/teacher romantic relationship, glitch imagery, some flashing lights/white screens, and suicidal speech/actions.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\tAll writing and programming was done by \tLore, though the main characters were originally conceived by:</p>\n<ul> <li>Shuuki - Nomi</li> <li>Natsume - Lore</li> <li>Masaharu - Nerrin</li> <li>Chiaki - Lain</li> <li>Yukinari - Kei</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\t\t\t\tAll art and UI was done by \tAuro-Cyanide.
