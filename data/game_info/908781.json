Until I got that fixed, have some downloads.</em><br/><br/>Make your experiment live! The new, experimental grow-vats have patiently been making artificial veins, trachea and small intestines. Ready for the (organ) harvest! Some of the organs need to be connected, it's up to you and your trusty scalpel,</p>\n<p>How to play:</p>\n<ul><li>Left click on the left side (donor-vat) to select the tissue. (Or drag + release for larger area.)</li><li>Right click to rotate your selected tissue.</li><li>Left click again to place!</li></ul>\n<p>Goals:</p>\n<ul><li>Brain and Heart need to be connected with the red veins.</li><li>Throat and Lungs need to be connected with the blue trachea.</li><li>Stomach and Large Intestines need to be connected with the (greenish?) 'small' intestines.</li><li>The blood going to the brain needs to be oxigenated: Cross over a blue trachea that is connected to the throat with a red vein.</li><li>The blood going to the brain needs to be enriched: Cross over a 'small' intestine that is connected to the stomach with a red vein.</li></ul>\n<p>Score:</p>\n<ul><li>Try to use as little time as possible OR;</li><li>Try to use as little donor-vats as possible.</li></ul>\n<p>Fixes (breaking &amp; QOL type bugs, allowed by the jam rules):</p><ul><li>Blood should need both air and food. Instead of checking for air, food was checked a 2nd time. (Winning the game even if air and blood didn't overlap).</li><li>When going full-screen, the info-label didn't scale with the camera.</li><li>On starting a 2nd game in the same session, colors of the source/sink organs (like brain/heart) where messes up</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T14:05:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/641/6410d648a11487637ae9b2019880ab53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["remco"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
