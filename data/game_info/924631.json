The gameplay consisted of defending the planet's core from root alien invasion. The player may get the planet's root to gain money and spend in one of the three power ups:\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Potato Launcher: The player can now shoot potatoes into aliens before they hit the planet soil. Every upgrade increases the weapon's fire rate.\r\n</li><li>Fast Forward: The player teleports to the other side of the planet. Every upgrade reduces the skill cooldown.\r\n</li><li>Speed: Every upgrade greatly increases the player speed around the planet.<br/></li></ul>\n<p>The player lives are the amount of roots in the core and the player always has an attack which it can grab alien on the soil. The game's goal is to survive the longest time until the player eventually dies, because the enemies will become harder along with the time.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>A, D: Movement around the planet</li><li>S: Root attack</li><li>Z, X, C: Buy on the shop</li><li>Mouse and left click: Shoot the Potato Launcher</li><li>Spacebar: Teleport</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Developed by<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Carolina Ara\u00fajo (@caradepeido)<br/>Francisco Pinto<br/>Leonardo Duarte (@leonardo_drt)<br/>Lucius Vinicius (@tgnics)<br/>Lu\u00eds Chaves<br/>Pedro Val\u00e9rio<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T16:26:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ee/1eeb5cd532b44558ce00432b5f0def56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lucius Vinicius"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
