The placement of the turrets is more important than how \"powerful\" they are by themselves. And unlike other tower defense games in this one you will have to both advance and retreat depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>Plan your defense both tactically and strategically, challenge your skills and outsmart the enemy. Choose the careful and forgiving path or risk everything and get the jackpot. But above all, PROTECT THE KING!<br/>\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Install</strong></p>\n<p>Download the zip file, extract the folder and use the .exe file found inside to start the game!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-25T11:34:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af0/af0e5dafbff64d1e2e4886db24dbc0c7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Futuregames"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
