I think I accomplished this by adding weapon animations for every action and subtle responses to each movement and stance change. There is only one gun model and set of animations for now, but more will be added. Different guns for now use the same model with different colors/materials. I intend this project to be the base reference for games I make in the future. I will update it as more additions and changes come. Please feel free to send me feedback here or on Discord at Acidic#5390</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T08:26:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5c1/5c159635b2e9a9aaee3cb4a7b5311c50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 57, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TylerDelange"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
