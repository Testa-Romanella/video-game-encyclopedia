I am the producer Louie.Author's message:This is still a new game. At this point, I can finally say that the goal of the ShineG series is to design new games.<br/>Can I finish 100 in my lifetime? Maybe I can also challenge the Guinness World Record.Works description:Shine and his friends came to a world of squares. A factory that specializes in robot NPCs for games has problems. The robot NPC in the factory has an abnormality. We must sanction these NPCs.<br/>In combat, players need to eliminate blocks to launch skills. You can combine blocks to get props and skills, or you can gain extra abilities through passive skills.<br/>There are more than one hundred kinds of squares in the game.<br/>24 active skills<br/>20 passive skills<br/>Equipment is a good way to improve your ability, divided into weapons and protective gear.<br/>Weapons increase the power of the character and correspond one-to-one with the character.<br/>Protective gear can improve the player's defense against bullets, explosions and laser weapons.<br/>Weapons are randomly generated.<br/>The props are divided into two categories: ordinary and super. More than a dozen small categories, more than 40 pieces. You will definitely need them.<br/>When exploring, you need to carefully observe the mines buried on the ground, if you don't want someone to sacrifice. Explore can expand your backpack, add your items, and update your gear.<br/>If you defeat the enemies you encounter, you can get even more powerful skills and equipment.<br/>I made a new design for the layout of the minefield. When you play the game, you won't feel tired anymore, and you won't be killed at once, because you have four characters.<br/>The new minefield will make the game more interesting.<br/>If you are already familiar with the game, you get great skills, equipment and props. Then, you can show yourself, you will get the ranking on your steam, and compete with other players.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c9c/c9ccd7d2115b2853c54912c40acbf3de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GaluluGame"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GaluluGame"], "esrb_rating": null}
