{"id": 823647, "slug": "server-owner-tycoon", "name": "Server Owner Tycoon", "name_original": "Server Owner Tycoon", "description": "Step into the shoes of an aspiring game server owner and lead your own online empire in this business simulation sandbox environment. Hire staff, launch your server, and take charge! Along the way, you must make tough decisions in complex situations to steer your server to the top. Poll your community, launch giveaways, manage your server host, implement new features, and more. Promote your server and establish an engaged community of fans, players, and media alike.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Have you ever imagined what it would be like to own a popular megaserver? Server Owner Tycoon lets you bring your vision to life. Choose your host, pick your server specifications, and connect to the internet to get started. As you build your online empire, choose what game features are best for your server, configure each feature to please your userbase, choose visual content that pairs well with your theme, and manage your server resources to ensure your players keep playing. With the right features and content, you can build a loyal fanbase to propel your server to the top!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Players on your server have a short attention span, so you will have to stay on your toes to keep users engaged. To keep your players returning to the server, you will need to interact with the community through community engagement activities. If your players don\u2019t stay engaged, you can\u2019t keep your server afloat!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nobody works for free! To keep your server running, you\u2019ll need to keep the server bank balance in the green. Earn money through minigame jobs, through attracting paying players with exclusive pay store packages, or, if you\u2019re desperate and have no choice, through server loans. Use the pay store and package system to design paid content that your users want and to keep them coming back for more. Keep your business expanding by using the financial dashboard to balance income and expenses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No business is an island - without good marketing, you won\u2019t get far. If you keep your players happy, marketing will be no problem as your users draw in their friends. You can also take advantage of random media events, and use your staff to promote your server on forums and elsewhere! Track your community sentiment and player count with the in-game engagement dashboard and \u201cplayer feedback\u201d section.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your staff members are critical to expanding your business! If you manage your staff well, they can do most of the work for you. Use the interview process to find suitable candidates, assign tasks, handle training and vacation, and manage staff salary to craft your optimal crew. Even with the best staff, be prepared to mediate disputes and reach compromises!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Don\u2019t get too comfortable; smooth sailing is not guaranteed when you\u2019re in the game server business. From viruses to staff disputes, random events will require you to remain vigilant and ready to respond. As these events arise on your journey, you must carefully choose how to counter - the consequences may be bigger than you can imagine! <br/><br/><br/>Featuring:<br/><br/><ul><li>Leaderboard<br/></li><li>Office design<br/></li><li>Customizable characters <br/></li><li>Community feedback<br/></li><li>Hosting panel<br/></li><li>Full music soundtrack</li></ul><br/>\u2026 And many more features you can discover for yourself in-game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-22T06:12:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/464002d15bc74b605c1b5d548747e734.jpg", "website": "https://serverownertycoon.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 241, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["YuzuGames"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["YuzuGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
