That's it really.</p>\n<p>Your role in Badlands is less god and more curator. You are a tiny god. Sculpt the absurdly lo-fi landscape, watch a 5-pixel-wide person-square wander through a proceedurally generated tilemap. These are all real things I swear to you. You might even like it.</p>\n<p>I plan to continue developing this semi-slow-life toward an even slower and more lively thing. I want wandering tribes who set up camp in your world and wander off again, what little they leave behind becoming landmarks. I dream about this stuff.</p>\n<p>Badlands is barely more than an experiement I built over christmas / new years weekend 2016. Badlands is not to be taken orally. Ask your doctor if Badlands is right for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Funding Badlands</strong></p>\n<p>You can pay $1.50 to submit 3 names to the in-game random name generator. Find out how on the official website.</p>\n<p>Yes, the Springsteen song.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f3/6f3d493a070bba776d86b01e326b51d5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Phil Nelson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
