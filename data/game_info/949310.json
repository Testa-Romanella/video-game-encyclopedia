The pillars of the experience are Exploration, Light, Pursuit, Maze. It is a semi-hardcore game aimed at average and experienced players.<br/><br/>The entirety of the development is handled by a team of three (a programmer, a designer, and a composer), otherwise engaged in full-time jobs. The current state has been reached in less than half a year of sporadic work.</p>\n<p>While most visual assets are original work, some are still placeholders. We are aware of some balancing and technical issues and limitations, but will welcome any feedback.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T15:41:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e5/0e56bc44b6bd098436f41de8c025af23.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["nkkdn1993"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
