If you still can't see the full game let us know in a comment.</p>\n<p>If you have any trouble getting the builds to run let me know and I'll see about getting those fixed.</p>\r\nWhat it's all about\r\n<p>As a bored and powerful being you have decided to take it upon yourself to create worlds. Unfortunately you're not THAT powerful and you can only create small flat worlds, oh well. Roll up your sleeves, you're about to get your hands dirty.</p>\r\nThe Goal\r\n<p>Your goal is to use your somewhat powerful abilities to create worlds to certain specifications, be it a planet of cities, a giant swamp or some combination of the possible plots of land you can place.</p>\r\nThe short guide to creating worlds\r\n<p>I don't need to tell a being with powers how to do their job, but you may want to start by grabbing some land from your scroll of power and placing it onto the bedrock on the planet's empty husk. Sometimes you'll only need to fill a planet up to win, other times you'll need to meet certain quotas in order to create the perfect world (divine bureaucracy, am I right?) . One thing you'll notice right away is that each plot of land will often influence the land it is placed next to. A mountain can be completely eroded by an ocean, and a grassland can be settled in if a river is near.</p>\r\nWhere do I sign up?\r\n<p>As someone who wants to have the powers of creation you can sign up at your local power being recruitment center above.</p>\n<p>You can also get the mobile starter pack at the above location (Android only), proper recruitment center pending.</p>\r\nFinal words\r\n<p>We recommend trying the game on your Android device, it was our self imposed additional goal to make the game friendly. The current APK will say you need to allow installations from unknown locations (I swear no bad things were added). I'll be trying to put it on the play store later to facilitate things.</p>\n<p>In the screenshots we've added the possible combinations, for the best experience I recommend discovering them on your own but in the interest of saving people time for rating we'll decided to supply them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d87c6e2998de3cc9365539414e991a62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["mmason"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
