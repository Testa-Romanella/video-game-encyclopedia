It's a little passion project of mine.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>A big Thank You </strong> to\u00a0FEIDRY for doing the programming! He is a great guy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's very simple. The player is a Junimo, a forest ghost that looks like an apple. I like them a lot. In Stardew Valley, they harvest your crops every morning, so I had the idea of making them collect raining fruits! Each fruit gives a different amount of <strong>points</strong>. That's it!</p>\n<p><strong>Hope you like it!</strong></p>\n<p>You can buy Stardew Valley on Steam.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T04:52:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c32/c325dfaf8dc37f27a65901bd494c3d63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 78, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MatJamMat"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
