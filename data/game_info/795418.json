The stickman-like characters can be regarded as 11 Go pieces. Each time you move a piece, the characters will respond. <br/>Besides, the turn-based game consists of a series of levels, and needs some strategy to clear all of them. When trying to clear the game, you can also enjoy collecting achievements, watching fighting videos and exploring some stories ~  <br/>Wish you have a good time:D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T04:07:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b6/6b601e58af343e4e1fab3d4ae996ec60.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["\u5951\u91cd\u4eba"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u5951\u91cd\u4eba"], "esrb_rating": null}
