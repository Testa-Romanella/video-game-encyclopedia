It is very much fun to just keep mowing down hoards of different types of enemies(4 for 3 levels and 8 for other 2 levels) and always win just 20% time no matter how hard you try or how much you practice you have, and winning feels like wow i reached the finishing mark of big and very cumbersome sprint run and is very sweet feeling. Even this little Indie game can be among most enjoyable games and stands apart completely from the hoards of other Indie games due to its gameplay mechanics.<br/></p>\n<p>Instructions:</p>\n<p>1. Press the left mouse button to control and rotate the player.</p>\n<p>2. Press the left mouse button on screen on player and hold it to move it anywhere around the game, but remember not to take it too close to borders to avoid taking it half outside of the screen.</p>\n<p>3. Try to avoid clicking Start button on the top most area so as to prevent double clicking and making Level 1 open instead of Levels page.</p>\n<p>4. Please wait a little bit to sound(maximum 5 seconds) to load if somehow there happens to be a problem of sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T05:20:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7f6/7f6b34b6d9956e0951b4424e212722f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Ajay334"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
