{"id": 656373, "slug": "chaos-dungeon", "name": "Chaos Dungeon", "name_original": "Chaos Dungeon", "description": "<p>A game made for Brackeys 2021.2 Game Jam with the theme \"Let there be chaos\". The main feature of the game is the Chaos Bar. The more you stay in the dungeon the more it will fill. As it fills up enemies attacks will become stronger, and yours weaker. Use the left click to break barrels to get Gems and to attack enemies! Unfortunatly due to lack of time and a lot of issues and bugs\u00a0i wasn't able to bring the game at the state I wanted it\u00a0. I even modeled and fully programmed a final boss but didn't have time to implement into the game. Despite all that I had a lot of fun making the game and I also learned a lot of new things. I will make sure to continue this game and hopefully finish it, after I finish some other projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T22:21:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b19/b19d531dd26e0fbeb163538146026633.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Panos"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
