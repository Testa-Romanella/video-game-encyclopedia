(itch)", "description": "<p><strong>DESCRIPTION<br/></strong>You are a young wizard and need a book to pass your incantations\u00a0class, but the magic library is closing in 5 minutes! Get your book and get out before times runs out or you make so much noise you are kicked out.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br/>Arrow keys to move around around. That's it!</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS THOUGHTS<br/></strong>The theme for this Jam was silence so I wanted to create a game where your resource was silence. It's cliche, but silence\u00a0mostly thought about in a library so it seemed like the right location for the game to take place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was my third game and I wanted to incorporate sound for the first time. The theme made for an opportunity to focus on sound effects as a central part of the game. Each action creates noise and you must be careful with it. Additionally I wanted to experiment with the original gameboy resolution of 160x144 pixels. It's very limiting and I had to zoom out to make the maze portion easier.\u00a0</p><p>I also wanted to push my coding skills a bit more. This game included bumping off off walls instead of simply colliding with them and a small riddle UI menu which was new territory for me. This took longer to get right than I would care to admit. Text boxes were also a challenge and I didn't get them quite correct before time ran out.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong>Character sprites by\u00a0Lanea Zimmerman found on OpenGameArt.com.
