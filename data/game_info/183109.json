Purpose of the race is simple, \u00a0gathering donations from those, which could actually afford a ticket. The winner of the race gets a GDC ticket for free! You little fellow over there look like you are desperate for a GDC ticket, why don't you come with me?</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Control your character with the arrow keys</li><li>Playtime: ~ 10 - 15min</li><li>This game contains voiced narration (so you should probably play with sound)</li></ul>\n<p>This is the result of my first ever game jam I was part of and there are so many things I've learned from this jam, but this might not be the right place to share these thoughts.</p>\n<p>Anyways.

The true purpose of the game is to make fun of the various aspects of the Game Dev Conference while using the jam topics as a reference. <strong>I didn't manage to complete the game on time, but I will further work on it and release a polished version with the whole story and reworking mechanics in the future! </strong>You can follow me on twitter for status updates.<br/></p>\n<p>I\u00a0hope\u00a0you\u00a0enjoy\u00a0my little fun GDC experience I've developed over the past week.<br/>Special Thanks to Davdus for doing the voice acting and animations.<br/>And thanks to everyone for sticking around and helping me create this fun little game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1e1/1e1994758bde072e697638cde02e2edd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 91, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CAVE"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
