Realism is very well done\u2026  Love the addition of the laser and flashlight capability too. \u201c - JD (Google Play)<br/><br/>\u201cWeaphones is the most realistic gun simulator I've found to date.\u201d - jon (Amazon App Store)<br/>_______________________________<br/><br/>\u00bb Please rate, review and join us on Facebook and Twitter to help decide what the next Weaphone should be.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-04-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:44:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/519/519441442dfe69b7d19ea187f185b284.jpg", "website": "http://youtu.be/UMk8JRq9M4Y", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Mark Raykhenberg"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Mark Raykhenberg"], "esrb_rating": null}
