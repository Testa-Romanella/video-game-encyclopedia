I use a \"gauntlet\" style tree structure with looping side paths that allow you to skip forward, see new dialogue/interactions, and make more decisions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I tried to channel an air of peace and joy when making this piece. These are days that I remember so fondly, and bring me so much happiness.\u00a0I want the player to have an easy time playing through this game.\u00a0 Hopefully, I can share a bit of my familial happiness with everyone who plays\u00a0:)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-13T15:05:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb8/cb872e849f3fffda3d0cabc467f18071.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Jasper B"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
