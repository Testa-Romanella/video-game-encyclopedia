Survive a minute by trading your score (retained upon death) for new abilities/upgrades. Inspired by the fantastic mobile game \"Magic Survival\"</p>\n<p>CONTROLS: WASD and Mouse</p>\n<p>CREDITS: Made by Beard or Die. Sounds selected from various purchased Humble Bundle packs. Wobbly shader by Sokpop. Started with this character controller:\u00a0https://gist.github.com/MarcelvanDuijnDev/1c09cd8501927395c2e64162b8b8652f\u00a0and this camera controller:\u00a0https://gist.github.com/MarcelvanDuijnDev/94938645e584b7031731fe39c658ec4c</p>\n<p>IDEAS for expansion: The enemy spawn areas and method is rudimentary so I'd like to improve that significantly. I'd like to make a longer-than-a-minute version with more abilities, more varied enemies, bigger effects for taking out groups of enemies. I've love your ideas and feedback for this small prototype.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T13:14:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02b/02bef31757a5c099d3386d32c2185b91.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Beard or Die"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
