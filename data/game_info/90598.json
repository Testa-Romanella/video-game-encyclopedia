This is a story that hopefully has comedy, romance, and heart. At the very least, it will have a lot of puns and glasses jokes.</p>\n<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Iris:</strong> A gentle, awkward, and surprisingly brave girl who tries her best.</p>\n<p><strong>Rieffe:</strong> Iris' kind but detached childhood friend who always worries about her.<br/></p>\n<p> <strong>Lanneis:</strong> A strict and sarcastic person who glares and pushes up his glasses way too often.</p>\n<p> <strong>Wynrou:</strong> A seemingly friendly guy who prefers to be easygoing nowadays despite being an awful person in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Reqieu:</strong> Used to be Iris' teacher. Serious but gentle and low-key sarcastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Val:</strong> Always worries about Iris and has difficulty with being honest with feelings.</p>\n<p><strong>Septem:</strong> A serious, kind, and dutiful boy who likes flowers. He's kind of shy once you talk to him. Always polite. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Henri:</strong> The third glasses character of the game.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warnings:</strong> blood (no gore), some themes of death and suicide<br/></p>\n<p>This game is a straightforward visual novel, so there's no walkthrough necessary. It will be very obvious when a choice will affect the ending.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>If there are any errors with the game, email me at batensan@gmail.com and I'll get to trying to solve it right away!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This game is currently in development! I'm uncertain about the release date, but feel free to ask if you have any questions.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>tumblr</strong></p>\n<p><strong>twitter</strong></p>\n<p><strong>curiouscat (for questions)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>email: batensan@gmail.com</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6c/b6cd1ed68686dc0b0a92b5a407ec14cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 200, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["batensan"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
