It is prone to crash if you knock over too many bottles and spill liquids. So, be careful!!</em></p><p><em>Tested on HTC Vive. Oculus Rift is untested.</em></p><p>You take on the role of a Bartender except something is different... you are a cat and you are serving other animals some drinks. That's right! You are serving some BOOZE to some ZOO animals (Get it? Booze Zoo -&gt; BooZoo). Also, the part about being a cat is quite fitting. Cats like to break things or knock things over.</p>\n<p>The game is simple:</p>\n<ul><li>Grab a bottle or two (filled with strange colored liquids) and start pouring/mixing the liquids into a mug/glass!</li><li>Pay attention to the icons above each Patron's head as well as the glowing spots on the counter to give the right drink to the correct patron.</li></ul><p>The game is still in an early prototype state, so there isn't a way to win yet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22ca61ac27d4a563faac7b44f10b10c4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 173, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Battlerock"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
