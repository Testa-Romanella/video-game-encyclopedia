Enjoy every single scene in crisp 1080p, which is powered by originals that are 7x larger for ultimate sharpness. Every single sprite and background is examined to the sub-pixel level, so visual perfection is guaranteed.<h3>Original Story</h3><br/>Fool Me Twice defined the starting point of Yellow Optic. Conceived in 2015 as a text-based novel, it has been remastered and redistilled into a visual form that is both edge-of-your-seat while beautiful to look at. The same writer that penned the original novel re-adapted the tale for a new medium, so the every bit of vision is as present as ever.<h3>Supporting Indie Artists</h3><br/>Ferrule Instincts was brought to life with the help of indie artist Pia \u201cNenetlitzi\u201d Coppins. A portion of sales from every single purchase of Ferrule Instincts will go towards the artist. It\u2019s not just a great experience for you, but also incredibly meaningful for the Yellow Optic team behind it.<h3>Light On Your Wallet, Light On Your Machine</h3><br/>Yellow Optic was founded on the idea that stories should be fun, and it should not come at the expense of the reader. Enjoy an uncompromising experience at an affordable price everyone will enjoy. And its ultra-lightweight package (smaller than 1 GB) means you can easily carry an extra Yellow Optic story with you alongside your already-huge library.<h3>Continuous Support</h3><br/>Just because it\u2019s small and compatible doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll let it just sit there!
