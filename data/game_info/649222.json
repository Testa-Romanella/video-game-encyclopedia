The trickster will try and cheat, and it's up to you to catch them out or out-cheat them yourself. Move your cards up to play them when it's your turn, and drag them down if you want to try and cheat. But be warned, if you're caught by your opponent, you'll be forced to draw 2 cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Game Rules:</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the card game is to lose all of the cards from your hand.<br/>Both players start off with 7 cards each, and a card is placed in the middle of the board.<br/>Cards can be played by swiping up on cards that can be played. Swipe down to begin to hide your card, if you get caught by the enemy you are forced to draw two cards.<br/>If you see the enemy trying to cheat away a card, you can click on the card to force them to draw the 2 card penalty.<br/>Only a card of the same suit or rank can be played on the top card in the middle, with both the player and the opponent taking turns placing a card on top of the previously played one. The only exception to this a rank 8 card, which can be played at any time.<br/>If you can\u2019t play on your turn, draw until you can.<br/>If the draw pile empties before a player wins, the used cards are shuffled back into the draw pile to be played again.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-16T03:52:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a5/1a5177415a33c4bd5594cec583596be8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KillJoshToday", "Ben Thompson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
