Cast spells, spell spells, become the land's most prolific flower arranger, and you might be able to discover the dark secrets of the town proper.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the world governed by the mythical and loved-by-all goddess Sakuya, no action can be undertaken before first spelling it by arranging letters in a vase like flowers. <br/><br/><br/><br/>When passers-by enter the peaceful and idyllic world, they cannot even walk or talk, but after learning to \"arrange\" those words using flowers and vases, the artform of flower-arranging reveals itself as a rich and infinitely deep concentration.<br/><br/><br/><br/>By changing just 1 letter of the Red Pedalwalker, the very first flower you encounter in the game, you can spell TALK, LIE, and ALTER! It's a very powerful flower indeed. As you learn more Spells, you'll be able to change more letters in more ways, and spell even longer and more complicated Spells.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Outsiders to the peaceful village home to the flower-arranging art have trouble grasping the village's strange way of life, and thus are a rarity.
