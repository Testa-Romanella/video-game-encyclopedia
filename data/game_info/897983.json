The 3\u00a0heroes of this story are sent out on a dangerous mission that messes with time\u00a0travel.\u00a0However, their mission was\u00a0not a\u00a0success,\u00a0and they crash-land a month back in time. When they landed, the chip they had injected\u00a0in them was damaged and no longer worked, therefore making them deceases on the eyes of the overlord that's\u00a0controlling\u00a0them. The futuristic space station they came from is high up in the sky and imposable to reach from the\u00a0ground. It's up to you and our 3 heroes to save the world, using the abilities of\u00a0the heroes together will help you adventure\u00a0through the world. Your\u00a0goal is to find a way back up to the station to warn our heroes\u00a0past selves of the\u00a0dangerous mission in hopes of preventing history repeating itself. Throughout your\u00a0journey you will uncover\u00a0more about the overlord and discover a dark secret about their world. Can you help our\u00a0heroes save the world?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Notice</strong></p>\n<p>This is a prototype game and some features mentioned could not be included.
