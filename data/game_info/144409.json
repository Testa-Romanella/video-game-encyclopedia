This is loosely based on the fact that many young adults (in this case my focus was South Korea) are influenced by Kpop stars who tend to get plastic surgery. It has become a social norm to get plastic surgery or liposuction from 16 on, it is probably because of the high influence by society to change or look like these kpop stars.</p><p>HOWEVER. It is important to remember that this also happens in America, and that South Korea has a smaller population so it is possible we are equal in amount of adults getting plastic surgery. Just not equal to amount per area. </p><p>As you continue to change in the game you keep getting smaller. This is because your influences of society has made your personality smaller - by striving to become someone else. And also signify your body getting smaller by getting liposuction. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d77/d7762d4084b714f62877ff5cd100dadd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Eleanor Garvey"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
