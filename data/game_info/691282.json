Maybe we are not sensitive enough, we do not know enough about the message or we simply don't have capacities to sense \"everything\".\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe decoded meaning could be different than the sender intended <strong>-\r\nEspecially when the sender is some unknown monstrous entity from outer space communicating with us about their everyday problems.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBut there are still many circumstances of (any) communication, that have to be taken into account.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe <strong>distance</strong>, from which the entity is communicating, could be significant - and it can even be coded into the message itself.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe <strong>temperature </strong>of the environment in which the message is being received could be also crucial.\r\nWe know that nobody is really capable to focus and really think clearly, when the temperature rises above the certain point.\r\nThat is why the future on earth is warm and bright.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nWhat about the <strong>time </strong>in which the message was sent? Times changes everyday (obviously) and you have to keep up! You just forgot to keep up for a second and the next thing you know, there is an alien entity communicating with you.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThe other important parameter is the average level of <strong>pollution </strong>(pm 2.5 particles), which is also used to calculate the environment after receiving the message (signal).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBut the <strong>message </strong>itself would be probably also coded differently. Mysterious aliens have a cultural background I don't know nothing about.\r\nMaybe the emotions or phenomena that we are experiencing on individual or global level are just the effects of some ordinary alien actions or attempts to communicate with us.\r\nIs it misunderstanding or overthinking?\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThese parameters not only influence the visual and audio representation on the alien message in the game (that messy noisy vector ball falling to earth), they also shape the \"impact\" visualization when the signal is successfully caught (in the middle).\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nParameters used:\r\n<br/>\n<strong>message \"ball\"</strong> = current location, initial location, time, message itself\r\n<br/>\n<strong>receiving \"impact\"</strong> =  current location, initial location, time, average temperature, pollution</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-08T05:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/726/72645ba5c9f4748f089b261e8943d873.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["somdoma"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
