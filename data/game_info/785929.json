Use your three weapons to take out the enemy and add time to the ticking clock. Beware that getting hit reduces your time by half and resets your combo count, however greed is good and getting multiple hits in quick succession increases your multiplier; the higher the multiplier the more time added per kill. Attempt to defeat the boss and win with plenty of time and a huge combo count!</p>\n<p>Notes: This is my first game ever developed and released. I'm working on another pixel art game (have been for a few years), so please leave comments on how you enjoyed it, hated it, or forgot about it. If there are any bugs, please let me know for future reference.</p><p>Credit to Jala Stram for the explosion sound effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-16T06:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8e/d8e40023259ff6cdfa035cca42acc3cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Slippi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
