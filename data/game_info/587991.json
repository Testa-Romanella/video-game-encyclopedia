Be it due to your inner sense of duty, or old-time camaraderie, you decide to meet your friend at his farm, someplace far away from the busy streets of Boston. What do you not know, though, is that this singular decision will forever blur the line between what you once considered real and what you simply disregarded as fiction.<br/><br/>Your old friend awaits you at the farm.</p>\r\nJoin our discord\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter\r\n<p>Follow us on twitter for all the latest updates\u00a0at:\u00a0@rvlgames</p>\r\nFull version on\u00a0Steam", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T04:25:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/560/560e4f00333299583a1a60553ce5a33d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RVL Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
