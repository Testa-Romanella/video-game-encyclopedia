The free tools i used were\u00a0Blender for modelling, Audacity for the music, Unity for the layout\u00a0and Visual Studios for the code.</p>\n<p>First, i\u00a0modelled the planets in blender using a sphere but with Saturn i had to add a torus (which is a ring). I then painted the planets and the sun whilst looking at pictures on google to help me.\u00a0Next, i exported the texture and model (as a .FBX) to unity where i organised the planets so they were in order and set the size to what i felt best. After that, i added 1 line of code, using visual studios, to make the planets spin realistically and another line of code to make all planets orbit the sun at a realistic speed. Then, i went to the unity asset store to get the background which is also free. I then found some nice music on freesounds.org\u00a0and downloaded it. After that, i used Audacity to export it to unity as a .WAV and set it to play as soon as the program was opened, on a loop. As soon as that was done, i used itch.io to make a page so people can play my \"game/simulation\"\u00a0and write all this.</p>\n<p>I have experienced a unity project before where i made an android game. An advantage i had is that i have been studying Python(A coding language) and i used some of that knowledge to help me with some of the coding.\u00a0It took me about 6-7 hours in total to do this.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0ec/0ec49ca9278d81a254547574b4cb9c49.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["deebeegames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
