Your soul has entered his body and you must go hunt to find food. This adventure game is not for everyone. This game is part free play and part mission based.  This game is not easy and it will be difficult to complete all the missions successfully.  I designed the game, and I can barely beat it.   <br/><br/>Features:<br/>--Control a powerful 3D Lion<br/>--Huge Terrain to Explore<br/>--Day and Night Versions of the map<br/>--12 Hunting Missions to Complete<br/>--Go for the High Score<br/>--High Quality Graphics in a forest setting<br/>--Be sure and check everywhere to uncover all the secrets\u2028<br/>Game play :There are 12 Hunting Missions to complete.  Hunt deer, horses, sheep, bears, and humans.  For each target you find, you will gain extra time.  Find all the targets before you run out of time. The targets are indicated on the button.  For example the first mission is to hunt down 8 deer.  For the button with the bear on it, the mission is to find all the bears.<br/><br/>Sneak up on your next victim.  Take down that horse.  Find all the bears. 12 Missions is more than enough to keep you entertained.  Race around the map before the time expires.<br/><br/>If you like playing Bear Simulator, Shark Simulator, Goat Simulator, Wolf or Dinosaur Sim, you will probably enjoy hunting as a Lion. If you don't enjoy those types of 3D free play games, you should look elsewhere because you will not enjoy this game.  Don't even bother downloading this game if you are not ready to have some imagination.  We did our best to simulate a fun lion hunting experience, but the game is not perfect, far from it.  <br/><br/>**Notes to players** This game is not for everyone. This is a type of game that some people love. other will find uninteresting. Some users asked us for a 3D Lion Game, so here it is. We think this game has many fun elements, we hope you do as well. It also pushes the performance limits of most devices. If you have a slow and underperforming device, it is unlikely this app will run smoothly.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T05:30:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c643a7a7c64996bebf0523e53d24be6f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["DevelopmentSquared"], "genres": ["RPG", "Racing"], "publishers": ["Benjamin Satterwhite"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
