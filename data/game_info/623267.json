Its not much but I wanted to publish something so I had something to show for a year of learning unity (my real project is no-where near ready to show )</p>\n<p>It's a never-ending stealth game. Each level has more rooms to get through to reach the next level. You must collect the key cards (shown in red on the security monitors)\u00a0to open the doors to the next room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use WSAD keys and mouse to control the character. When the green crosshairs light up you can use your grappling hook. Left shift to crouch. T to use your torch.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Security Monitors can give you an idea of the layout of the room and the location of the key card.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jump platforms propel you up on to walkways above the room, guards wearing hats cannot see up on the walkway and if you're quiet and keep to the walls the other guards will likely not spot you either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teleporters can take you to other parts of the room instantly but be sure to check the security monitors to see which teleporters are active and whether there are any guards nearby.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T07:04:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a66/a66da1e6a11e843815e48230950f4909.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RyanH82"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
