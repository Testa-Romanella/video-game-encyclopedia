With drifting around the corners or taking clever shortcuts improve your time to unlock new levels.</p>\n<p>This game was made for the NOKIA JAM 2023 and this is why it has only two colours and a very low resolution.</p>\n<p>You can find the instructions on how to run the game in the ZIP-file. On Linux you can run <strong>python corny.py</strong><em>\u00a0</em>and it will download needed packages and launch the game. On Windows you just have to run the <strong>corny.exe</strong> file.</p><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T05:49:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc8/fc8384f29530bcfd15b33496daf4e46c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["OsiPog"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
