It's a platformer where you can control a plague doctor, throwing explosive potions and dashing mid-air.<br/></p>\n<p>Known issues:<br/>if you start a dash exactly 1 pixel away from a platform the dashbar can't tell if you're dashing or jumping and you get in a limitless dash. The best way to revert this is to return to the original platform where you dashed.<br/>Originally it was intended for the player to have more than 1 hitpoint but the state machine was not robust enough to get that working with other mechanics, but the levels are short enough to play again when you die.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/286/28603bc30bf0c49392391a54fed85090.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gamercomposer87", "Foletto"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
