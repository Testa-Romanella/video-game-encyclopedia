I can't claim to be very musically inclined, but I hope it works well enough.</p>\n<p>Oh also, there is no save system, but the game is completable very quickly if you know what you're doing so getting back to your previous place is not hard.</p>\n<p>And if you'd like to follow my work, check out my Twitter: @Jusiv_</p>\n<p><strong>Thanks for playing, and let me know what you think!</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:16:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d4/6d496e577dc4fa06e2dee2378c7754f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Jusiv"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
