The two colours are the contrast as well as being\u00a0\u00a0the main game dynamic. When you are\u00a0 on the white colour you receive a speed buff and a wall climb ability, but you will die in 1 hit from the enemies. The white colour gives you 4 times more health and a projectile, but you are slower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are also some enemies if you manage to get further into the level.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>TajTheGuy (Taj Lokov\u0161ek)- Modeller and animator Artstation:\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/tajtheguy</p>\n<p>Normal (Ju\u0161 Dol\u017ean) - Programmer\u00a0</p>\n<p>Adonis (Denis Sel\u010dan) - Level designer and programmer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-01T06:44:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e9/4e9d6e39ebc85255e4bd7ef327cfe621.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TajTheGuy"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
