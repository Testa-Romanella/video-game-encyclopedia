This is the first time I've done that, the first time I get to finish and publish a real game even if it's this small.</p>\n<p>This was made for the KenneyJam2021, I am so glad I participated I actually managed to finish a game thanks to that. So a big mucho gracias to the hosts!\u00a0</p>\n<p>The theme was \"Rotation\" so I came up with multiple ideas, a platformer like Crash Bandicoot; Where you would play as an astronaut on a journey to destroy an evil spaceship AI. You would run forward and be able to turn about 30 degrees when running and you would jump and attack with a spin. Then I had an idea about making a PACMAN style game; Where you run away from aliens as an astronaut in a circular hallway, but then I thought nah. And yesterday at night I started working on this. I've worked on it all night, honestly I'm exhausted it still doesn't feel just perfect. But hey what are updates for right? This is the simplest kind of gameplay I could come up with, you turn around with mouse point at alien and shoot which honestly I like how I made it regardless of the feeling of needing to make it better.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you have a wonderful day or night, much blessings from yours truly and I hope you enjoy the game I made! - GioGo<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T14:14:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa0/fa0fe2254d6f1205617c5cdfd928de42.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GioGo"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
