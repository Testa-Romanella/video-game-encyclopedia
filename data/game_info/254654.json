Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch\u2019s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror.<br />\nThe Witch\u2019s House is deliberately designed with traps at <em>almost</em> every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time.<br />\nWith completely remastered visuals, The Witch\u2019s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game.<br />\nA horror atmosphere wherein players solve puzzles based on clues found in the house.<br />\nCompletely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience.<br />\nBrand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue.<br />\nViolence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised.<br />\nSudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep.<br />\nItems must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves.<br />\nFixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat).<br />\nGame pads are supporting and recommended.<br />\nHead phones <em>strongly</em> recommended.<br />\nHello. I&#39;m Fummy, creator of The Witch&#39;s House MV.<br />\nI&#39;m happy to announce that we&#39;re finally ready to release the game.<br />\nThe Witch&#39;s House MV is an RPG Maker MV remake of the original game, which was released back in 2012.<br />\nWe remade all the graphics, including map tiles and character sprites, and worked hard to enhance the atmosphere and 2D beauty in The Witch&#39;s House. It took us five times as many hours to create this version, but we feel like we&#39;ve finally managed to satisfy ourselves.<br />\nAside from graphical improvements, we also added two new difficulty settings that was not present in the free version.<br />\nThe first difficulty setting is a more accessible one that allows you to instantly retry. The other difficulty setting is a more difficult one which is only unlocked by those who manage to reach the game&#39;s true ending.<br />\n&quot;The normal difficulty isn&#39;t enough to satisfy me...&quot;<br />\n&quot;I&#39;m not averse to instantly dying upon reaching new areas.&quot;<br />\nIf either of these describe you, then we recommend you give this new difficulty a try. You also may be able to uncover some new story bits concerning &quot;her&quot;...<br />\nThe world of The Witch&#39;s House has been reborn anew, and we sincerely hope you&#39;ll all enjoy it.<br />\nMy name is Dan Stern and I\u2019m the Scholar of the First Deal at DANGEN Entertainment (sounds fancy, but it means I work with the devs to get their games released so you can play them).<br />\nJapan has a longer tradition in 16-bit horror games because of the variety of games that was released on the Super Famicom. But that wasn\u2019t something I experienced because of growing up in the West. It wasn\u2019t until I discovered The Witch\u2019s House some years ago that I learned 16-bit games can scare me just as well as high-res AAA games made in 3D. I learned that even in pixel-art, horror is possible; it just depends on the creator\u2019s mastery of atmosphere and timing. Fummy-san absolutely has that mastery and as silly as it sounds, I\u2019ve never had so much fun dying a lot in a video game.<br />\nI was ecstatic to find out that not only is there a remaster of my favorite indie horror classic, but that DANGEN could help to get that game in front of fans that I know will love it. Playing The Witch\u2019s House MV feels like a totally new experience and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have fun with the new content after you finish your first playthrough.<br />\nCheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-08T18:43:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d5/9d54f41a1221294f5f76b12630786815.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.21, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 12, "owned": 82, "beaten": 42, "toplay": 15, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 39, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 39, "platforms": ["PC", "Nintendo Switch", "macOS"], "developers": ["Fummy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DANGEN Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
