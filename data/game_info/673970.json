In the arena, the player needs to kill all of the enemies without dying.</p>\n<p>This game implements a simple AI using a state machine approach\u00a0for the enemies. They alters between patrol mode and attack mode. They randomly move around in patrol mode, and shoot at the player in attack mode.</p>\n<p>To ensure that neither the player nor the enemy will be killed in a bullet storm instantly, I have set a timer to prevent damage from happening too frequently.</p>\n<p>The modeling for the arena and the gun is done with Blender.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T10:10:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a1/1a1ed8b6c15e634409e414dbed6ddbc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zixuan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
