Very simple, kind of weird.</p><p>The Adventures of Super Bean was my first platformer. It tried to do a lot of stuff, and I never actually finished it. It's cute</p><p>Super Bean Advanced was the game I made after playing Super Meat Boy for the first time. It's too hard and the platforming physics leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>TxT God was the game I made after playing Minecraft for the first time. It's very weird, and I\u00a0think the first game I ever made with all (or mostly) GML. You collect power-ups to be able to place and destroy different blocks. A\u00a0cute idea but not very fun.</p><p>DIP was the game I made after playing the Knytt games for the first time. It was a multi-year endeaver and was never finished due to a crash. It's only missing music for the Gravity Castle though. It's very hard but kind of fun.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/790/79002f31e35ca36994ff3cc5b62cf113.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 47, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Benal"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
