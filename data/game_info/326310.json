A world where crafts are not made of cedar, but of magic. A world where shipwrecks and robberies were nothing but a tale.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut, there is something dark lurking within the depths of the network. Creatures that surf the wave of the Hyperlane, feeding on any unfortunate enough to come within its path. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur survivors are hanging on by a strand. The builders who once drew the world by hand, have been lost forever.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWelcome to the Oculus, a simulated world designed to act as a means of removing The Threat. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFour years ago, a battle between the dark and light raged through our network. Average citizens went about their day without a care in the world, but one company held firm against the tide as waves of cyber attacks flooded our planet.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFractum Technologies, an independent tech developer, finally failed to hold the line on the date of April 22, 2015. As a result, a series of cyber attacks swept across the planet, forcing a massive power crisis. The resulting crisis enabled Fractum's security lock-down procedure, trapping the members of the facility inside until they could find a means of escape.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn a final act of desperation, a device, known as the Oculus was developed, and a new world was created. A signal was sent out to the old world, welcoming all of those foolish enough to enter. The signal promised a world full of wonder and mystery, but in reality there is only darkness. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnter the Oculus, a procedural world that never ends!
