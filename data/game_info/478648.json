This is the second game that I've made, so it was quite challenging to finish within such a short amount of time (it's not really finished, but just playable).</p>\n<p>The theme for the jam was \"<strong>REWIND</strong>\", and we had 7 days to make a game which that aligns with the theme.\u00a0It was kind of hard for me to come up ideas because....rewind is quite a hard one to come up with ideas.</p>\n<p>So this game is about a boy who fell into the \"Time Lord\" mouth and he wants to kill him (title of the game kind of gives that away). The Time Lord has a special power, which is to control time (duh!). He can control time with his nose, that's why his nose looks like a <rewind> and <fast forward=\"\"> button.</fast></rewind></p>\n<p>I made the entire game myself with Unity and drew all of the pixel art (my first time drawing pixel art), so please if you could provide some feedback, would be awesome! :)</p>\n<p><strong>Good luck and have fun!</strong></p><p><strong>******************************************************************</strong></p><p><strong>Know Bugs:</strong></p><ul><li>I forgot to turn off a development feature, so when you press \"Space\" bar, it generates another platform layout</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T07:47:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cd0/cd04b0f6acb690399dee3ed50f4cdebf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["level1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
