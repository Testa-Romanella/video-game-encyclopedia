So all feedback is appreciated .\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the game you control a Catapult, and you have to shoot the Evil Flying Pumpkins that have come to haunt your house. The more Pumpkins you shoot the more points you'll receive! But! Take care, the Evil Flying Pumpkins have come with friends. The powerful Ghosts will try to protect the Pumpkins from being shot, if you hit a Ghost instead of a Pumpkin you'll lose some score.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To play just click the catapult, and drag to tense the mechanism. The more tense it is, the further will the rock be shot.\u00a0 While clicking there will be a Crosshair that will let you know where the rock will be shot.\u00a0</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>A I'm no artist, I've chosen a bunch of interesting assets from different sites. All due credit to the wonderful artists that allow use to use their work. You're wonderful!</p>\n<ul><li>Font\u00a0By Kenney</li><li>UI items\u00a0By Kenney</li><li>Tileset\u00a0By Kenney</li><li>Crosshair\u00a0By Kenney</li><li>Ghosts\u00a0By Master-Blazter</li><li>Pumpkins\u00a0By Charlot-Art</li><li>Background By Migcreatesgames</li><li>Catapult By Yd</li></ul>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to play this, and for the feedback!!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T03:20:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/521/5210c1d8e63249a7442b92c01deb6cd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mrjdiez"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
