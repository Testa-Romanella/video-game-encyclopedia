Two to three weeks seemed like forever, yet passed as if it were nothing.<br/>I hope you'll enjoy the introduction, the tiny bit of gameplay there is and otherwise that you might be \"amazed\" by the game world. A large amount of time was spent on that alone.</p>\n<p>There is not much of a true ending but if you return to the downtown area by metro after restoring the power in Hub Control the characters will all say something else.<br/></p>\r\nHow to start the game\r\n<p>Step into the train cart and push it forward until it starts moving out of its own. Fasten seatbelt if desired by pressing E to lock yourself to the cart (the same for the metro).<br/></p>\n<p>A tiny warning in advance: this game has some flickering visuals in it during part of the game.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse: Look around/rotate<br/>E: Interact<br/>Space: Change element (visual style and visibility)<br/>WASD/ZQSD: Move, push train cart<br/>M: Toggle WASD/ZQSD<br/>Left mouse button: shoot/weld (on boards)<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Everything in this entry was made by me, Bart, during the jam period, except for the following sound effects: electric arc effect, weld effect, horn effect and restore power effect. These were taken from zapsplat.com<br/>Music created with LMMS. Additional sound effects recorded and modified using Audacity.<br/>The Mgmt District background tune was modified from an existing melody that I already created before.<br/>3D models were all done in Blender and exported using my set of Blender exporters.<br/>Additional fonts used in the game: Automania, Bellerose, Chunkfive, Coventry Garden, Flottflott, Hello Denver, Monoton, Parklane, Picadilly, Rationale, Tonight, Mama</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-25T09:52:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c7e1620c2cdf4a54a72dc2e18f1dc5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 119, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WiseBart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
