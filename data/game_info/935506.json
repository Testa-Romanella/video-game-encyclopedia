Sick of your antics, the Witches set up a trap that you inevitably fall for. They throw you in a cell beneath the catacombs so they can live out the rest of their years without you stealing from them. You, a quick-witted cat, notice a stray key lying around your cell. How many things can you steal without the witches knowing? And with you making it out in one piece?</p>\n\r\nAsset Credits\r\n\n<p>SPRITES:</p>\n<p>- Player: https://9e0.itch.io/cute-legends-cat-heroes</p>\n<p>- Witches:\u00a0https://9e0.itch.io/witches-pack</p>\n<p>- Tiles:\u00a0https://rekkimaru.itch.io/dungeon-rpg-tileset</p>\n<p>- Icons:\u00a0https://cheekyinkling.itch.io/shikashis-fantasy-icons-pack</p>\n<p>AUDIO:\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0GAME LOOP -&gt;\u00a0https://crossedkiller.itch.io/dungeon-music</p>\n<p>- START MENU -&gt;\u00a0https://void1gaming.itch.io/free-game-menu-music-pack\u00a0track 19</p>\n<p>- SFX: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/free-casual-game-sfx-pack-5...</p>\r\nPRESENTATION\r\n<p>here</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T15:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a90740532b6d345d76ecb0ad4aa99c3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["apoorvak", "Taneim", "Juliana Soranno"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
