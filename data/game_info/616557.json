The Demo", "description": "<p>Help a little Cephalopod avoid being eaten!<br/>Enjoy this cute little Chrome Dinosaur-like game :)<br/><br/>This is my second jam ever but my first using this library, sorry for the lack of features, I'm still getting used to it.<br/>Made in just over 2 and a half hours\u00a0using LibGDX for graphics and physics. Setting up the backend of the project (Contact listener, Input listener, etc.) took up about an hour. Making assets and coding mechanics took up the remainder of the time.<br/><br/>Controls: W / S : SPACE / CTRL : UP-ARROW / DOWN-ARROW</p>\n<p>On Windows: Alt+F4 should close the game, I'm not sure on other platforms, my apologies for not adding a way to quit.<br/><br/>This game seems unfinished because it is. I had plans for a few more mechanics, environments, and animations but I ran out of time. I'll be adding them in post-jam.<br/><br/>Assets used:\u00a0<br/>https://sergeant-slash.itch.io/32x32-animated-shark-sprite<br/>https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-octopus-sprites<br/>https://rapidpunches.itch.io/freshwater</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T11:03:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2c/a2c19456422f7b9bcd8d8943fa4b3b54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["wasupmacuz"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
