Well, this is not that game! In Parcel \"Dispatched\", your mission is to ensure that the warehouse does not overflow with parcels, dispatching them by any means necessary, either by \"gracefully\" placing them onto the logistics van, sending them flying through the faulty teleporter that has a chance to send it flying right back at your face, or just throw them off the map! At the Parcel Dispatching company, if the parcel has left the warehouse, then as far as we're concerned it has arrived at its destination, regardless of where it ends up!</p>\n<p>Don't bother yourself with questions like \"won't customers get angry\", \"why does the floor suddenly stop\", and \"how is the van flying?\",\u00a0 focus on dispatching those parcels!</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ways to dispatch parcels - you can stack as many parcels as you can fit in the dispatch van to the left of the warehouse then press T to send it on it's merry way (it takes a short while to return, plus extra time depending on how many parcels it's hauling), or you can send them through the teleporter. This will instantly dispatch the parcels, but beware! It has a chance to reject a parcel, sending it flying right back into the warehouse!</p>\n<p>If the logistics van is out on a delivery and the teleporter is offline, well, you've obviously got no choice but to destroy the parcels by throwing them out of the warehouse into the abyss!</p>\n<p>Try to keep the warehouse under control and don't let it run out of space!</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Mashing <strong>E\u00a0</strong>in stacks of parcels will help you carve a path of carnage!</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>A &amp; D</strong> to move left and right</li><li><strong>E</strong> to pick up/throw parcels.
