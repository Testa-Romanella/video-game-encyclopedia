Take turns as the Runner and Bigman, as you try to beat your opponent at their own game! While one player, the Runner, makes their way through the platforming stage, the other, the Bigman, will get an array of random enemies and attacks to sabotage the Runner. If the Runner is taken out by one of the Bigman's traps, they immediately swap roles! First Runner to make it to the finish is the winner!</p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p>Conner Sweeney\u00a0</p><p>Ross Magargee\u00a0</p><p>Giovani Tejeda\u00a0</p><p>Ashley Jones\u00a0</p><p>And all our friends who playtested!</p><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T20:31:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1a8/1a86d11cbbf60b6687a7e3bbc4b44c09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 153, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Honua"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
