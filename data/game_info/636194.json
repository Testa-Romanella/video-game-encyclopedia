This Mod is adding BF's Big brother, (aka BB). BB mod is a vanilla run mod to showcase that some mods can look great and be compelling without using other sources. This mod has built-in DfJk controls to switch in the options menu to turn on or off, as well as down scroll option. BB mod is not a bullet-hell mod but a calm chill-like mod more around the story of the character more than the actual gameplay. This mod is not perfect, and there are a few hiccups no doubt but please understand this mod was created by only 4 people total.<br/>Thank you to my amazing small team to do so much work!</p>\n<p>Slamreon : coder<br/>Robot: Charter<br/>Elbendy: Musician\u00a0<br/>Kittypop: Art/assets/ writer<br/><br/>Va: Cougar mcdowell</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-16T08:41:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75d/75da54b1f68c2abaab415fd4143e4b3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Friday Night Modding"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
