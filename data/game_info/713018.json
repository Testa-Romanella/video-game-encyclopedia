It's entire premise is built around exploring an expansive maze of rooms and solving puzzles along the way as you unravel the mystery of what brought you to this place.<br/><br/>As this project is still only in infancy, this first release is nothing more than a demo of the movement engine. built to let players test the first wave of abilities before I move on to puzzle mechanics and enemies.<br/><br/>If you find any bugs while playing please feel free to let me know about them so that this project can improve!</p>\n<p>P.S. The game has no audio or SFX in its current state.<br/><br/>If you like this project and wish to support its development, I have a Patreon available that offers early access to demo releases, behind the scenes progress updates, and at the highest tier, you can get a statue in game featuring your name as a special thanks for your support.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/22Pepperjack</p>\n\n<p>Original Resource credits:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Unedited Tileset and Props by aamatniekss</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Various effects by\u00a0unTied Games</p>\n<p>\u00a0- Character sprites by\u00a0Thomas Lean</p>\n\n<p>Known Bugs:</p>\n<p>\u00a0- sometimes turning off a rooms light and back on again will remove all player skills instead of just one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0- player will occasionally get stuck in slopes.
