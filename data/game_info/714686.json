Dash around with unique drag and drop controls, bypass the ordinary laws of gravity and explore this magical world full of puzzles just waiting to be solved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My goal was to make as accessible game as possible so that everyone can enjoy it.\u00a0 It all began with controls. The controls needed to be intuitive, and most importantly fun. I love platforming games for their challenging levels, and I wanted to explore beyond the usual arrow controls. While I love pixel art or geometric super simple look of games, I understand that it's not for everybody. The challenge here was to create sort of a fairytale style, and very atmospheric. To simply create a world that would be mysterious and joy to explore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that as for now, this is just a preview focused on gameplay and with a few bugs. I might add the story elements in the future, but it depends on feedback. That's why I would love if you told me what you think about the game. What's good? What's bad? Should I continue in this direction with level design or art? Or perhaps go for something completely new and abandon this project. I will gladly read every feedback and take it to heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>For the best experience is recommended the downloadable version.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you get stuck, at any time hit R for restart of the level.\u00a0</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-27T04:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e33/e33ea756089918baeb5bdae38d2cf92e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["EdenSoft"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
