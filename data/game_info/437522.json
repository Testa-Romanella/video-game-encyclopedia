There is another problem, that being the Knight is a Pacifist, he would rather die than fight and dodge than die. Run through these levels as fast as possible and dodge all the dangers that may pop up so you can get back to the surface, back to the light!\u00a0More levels will be added frequently so stay tuned. Donations are helpful so that I can spend more time on game development and creating my own assets. Enjoy!!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:05:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ca/8ca7f9c149bcf092892344b880644f24.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LT DEV"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
