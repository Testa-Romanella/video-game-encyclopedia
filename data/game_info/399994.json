This allows the player to teleport back to its original spawn point upon collision.\u00a0<br/>- Removed the \"Try Again\" button from each ending scene as it was redundant. (You're not supposed to restart on the same level)<br/>- Removed some ImageTexts that covered \"story\" from \"Maplestory\" simply because it looks silly.\u00a0<br/>- Made the jumping a bit \"less floaty\".<br/>- The answers in Levels 2 and 3 don't have to be rounded anymore. The divisor is a common factor of the dividend now. (Great suggestion!)<br/>- Fixed a bug that caused the 2 X's from the \"50/50\" item to not be destroyed when colliding with an answer.<br/>- Fixed a bug that caused more than one instance of the 2 X's from the \"50/50\" item to spawn.<br/>- Found a bug where the square root symbol '\u221a' wouldn't show up in Level 3, thus displaying the wrong question with wrong answers. It's been replaced with \"sqrt()\".*<br/>* There is no way to fix this bug. It's a problem with WebGL.</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the feedback and bug reports!<br/>- Kin Lou</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:28:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/52d/52d0058add78feb90bc0be95f4ce1b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["akatsuki1423"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
