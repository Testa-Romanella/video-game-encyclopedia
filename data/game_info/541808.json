However, the Christmas gifts have not been arranged for distribution yet. Tomorrow is the Christmas day and everyone in the village, especially the children, are looking forward to celebrate the day. That is where Orange santa plays a significant role and his only mission is to collect the Octa-coins and buy the gifts for the children from the Special Orange store located in some of the secret locations. However, this is easier said than done because these special coins, called \"Octa-coins\", can be found in some of the secret areas which are under tight security. It is next to impossible for a common Orange man to enter the facility. But Orange Santa is equipped with a special weapon which is sufficient enough to deal with the Fruitus Army. <br/>You play as Orange Santa and you have less than a day to accomplish your mission. Collect the Octa Coins, buy the Christmas gifts and distribute among the children of various Orange villages. <br/><br/>Will you be able to complete the mission objective? The rest is up to you!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Key Features:<br/></strong><br/><strong>- 30 Levels to play!<br/>- Various kinds of enemies including Giant Snow Monster!<br/>- Lots of traps and obstacles!<br/>- Challenging situations and hard to master!<br/>- Collect items including health, ammo, coins etc.<br/>- 2 Different Firing Modes!<br/>- Story Driven<br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Minimum System Requirements:</p>\n<p>For Windows:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1, 10\r\n</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core 1 Ghz or higher\r\n</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM\r\n</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 128 MB of Video Memory, Capable of Shader Model 2.0+\r\n</li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c\r\n</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 50 MB available space\r\n</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Any Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>\n<p>For Linux:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 14.04 or Higher\r\n</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core 1 Ghz+\r\n</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM\r\n</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 128 MB of Video Memory\r\n</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 50 MB available space\r\n</li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Any Compatible Sound Card</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T04:39:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dcd/dcdaaf91ddef250f81adebc67159f4a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["AMAXANG GAMES"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
