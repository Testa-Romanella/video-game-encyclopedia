Each character has their own abilities to fight enemies with. <br/></p>\n<p>An entry for the week-long SGDA Game Jam 2020 where the theme was \"Internet Friends\",  Team Building is a proof of concept. The idea was to create an auto-battle game where your choice of characters would affect the outcome. Certain friends might synergize well with each other, while others might conflict. We also planned to have characters go offline at times, since the online friends are playing in different time zones.</p><p>This game does not have any audio. All characters and particle effects were made during the jam.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Roy Konan - Concept, Character Design<br/></p>\n<p>Riley Park - Particles, Character Models, Environment<br/></p>\n<p>Brian Dizon - Programming, Implementation, Animation<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-03T03:50:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c5/3c58dec251cee7561cf617959b284152.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Niborious", "Riley"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
