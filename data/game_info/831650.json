I\u00a0do not actually ship them in real life, but I do like their bit where they act like they are married.\u00a0There is canon-typical explicit dialogue. Fullscreen mode should fix any formatting errors.</p>\n<p>This was written because Fumi asked off-handedly where their dating sim was, and so I\u00a0decided to spend a few hours quickly making this. It's her birthday after all. I'm sure there are no flaws. I see the capitalization errors and you should embrace them.</p>\n<p>yes I had to make an account just to figure out where to upload this</p>\n<p>I\u00a0DON'T\u00a0KNOW WHY THE FONT IS LIKE THAT ON MOBILE</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-05T18:12:25", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["trustycustard"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
