This one ticks all the boxes. Let me take you on a short adventure into the Monoverse world.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Backstory</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You wake up and realize that you are a ball. Beneath you \u2013 lava. You look up and see that you are hanging from a seemingly magical rope attached to a platform suspended in the air. You are not completely still, but swing left and right. How do you get out of this pickle? Maybe you can try to swing and try to increase the momentum? Throw the rope to the next platform?\u00a0Maybe this way you will find a safe space? Let's hope so. Good luck!</p>\n<p><strong>Key bindings</strong></p>\n<ul><li>A and D \u2013 swing/walk left and right</li><li>W \u2013 jump</li><li>SPACE \u2013 point with a cursor at a non-spikey platform, press SPACE and the rope between you and the target will appear. Press again to remove the rope</li><li>X \u2013 reset the game</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Tips &amp; tricks</strong></p>\n<p>Since this game is pretty damn broken, you might need some help to get through it.</p>\n<p>While jumping over the building, you might need some extra boost. Try to find the right angle and hit D to boost your velocity mid-air (helpful bug!). You can also try to hit W to jump mid-air.</p>\n<p><strong>Source code</strong><br/></p>\n<p>You will find the source code downloadable below. The map in the source code is outdated since I accidentally ran a `git checkout .` without committing my changes first. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Assets</strong></p>\n<p>All custom made!\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T08:15:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2c/f2c884ed3b200dea6a031dc1bc366e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kjagiello"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
