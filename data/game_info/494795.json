Fill in the comics\u2019 missing spaces by finding images through a series of themed sites. Is that comic character thinking about Donkey Kong, or a gruff inspector? Is the true cause of the COVID pandemic a glass of milk? In Comic Scavenger Hunt, that\u2019s for you to decide.<br/></p>\n<p>Each round, the players are given a partially-filled-in comic and a link to an image site. Within a 90 second timer, they must search through the site to find an image that finishes the comic in the best way they can think of. When the 90 seconds are up, the players all PM the images they found to Voltaire bot, who pastes them in the Discord server\u2019s chat anonymously. Finally, the players vote on the best image for the given comic, before moving on to the next round!</p>\n<p><strong>Full rules and needed tools available in the rulebook:</strong></p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAgLWnR5BTdvL6Ro0ZVqBTc0kL3Vuq6B/view?usp=shari...</p>\n<p><strong>Comic generator:</strong></p>\n<p>https://editor.p5js.org/soppart/present/JJhnIvB9O</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T03:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f70/f7018e821a99dd822ff13eabe00da3d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["soppart"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
