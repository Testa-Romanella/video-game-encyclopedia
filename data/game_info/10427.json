{"id": 10427, "slug": "sumer", "name": "Sumer", "name_original": "Sumer", "description": "<p>Sumer is a unique blend of modern board game design and exciting real-time action, set against the beautiful backdrop of a mysterious ancient civilization.<br />\nTo claim the throne, four nobles of the ziggurat must compete for Inanna\u2019s favor. She is not easily pleased, but what god is? To prove your worth you must perform sacrifices according to Inanna\u2019s sacred rituals. Place your workers in workshops to gain resources and goats. Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities. Only the swiftest and cleverest noble will become the ruler of Sumer. A Worker Placement Video Game!<br />\nSumer takes the board game mechanic of worker placement to a new level. Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they&#39;ll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it! Real-time Dynamic Auctions!<br />\nWhoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna&#39;s blessing! The auction is simple \u2014 just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item\u2019s real price until time is up! Trick your opponents into overpaying for their bids while you snag good bargains for your own! Key Features<br />\n1-4 players - Play local with up to 4 players.
