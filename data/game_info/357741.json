It's a pretty easy, straight-forward game. Please enjoy :)</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<ul><li> Arrow Keys / WASD to move</li><li>Z / J to interact.</li></ul>\n<p>(If you ever find yourself stuck, I've written a guide here that will hopefully be of use!)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Due to my own technical limitations, Soul Void does not have any music. Please feel free to put on your favorite lo-fi chill ambient noises to get spooky to, or really whatever floats your boat.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES:</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>There may be a slight audio pop when starting the game/switching tabs.</li><li>When talking to NPCs, there's a <em>very</em> rare chance that\u00a0free-roaming actors may break their boundaries and wander off screen. Let them be free; they'll come back with a scene change.</li><li>Due to positioning, NPCs might pop over the dialogue box. They won't impede your ability to read however; they just want a little extra attention.</li></ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>* Currently investigating an uncommon bug that causes the yes/no dialogue boxes to break. Several yes/no dialogues have since been removed\u00a0to reduce the chance of encountering this bug.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb8/fb85e957fe9736031eb08a24871419ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"beaten": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 59, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kadabura"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
