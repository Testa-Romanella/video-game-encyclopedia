Originally the game was released in November 2011 for Windows and was free. Later the game appeared on Steam in the extended Deluxe edition, which included the original game, the soundtrack and the DLC of Teleporter Chambers.</p>\n<h3>Fast paced stealth</h3>\n<p>Each level of the game is a streak of obstacles, which requires the player to the accuracy of the pixel while moving forward in the shadow. The game has a dynamic lighting system, so it will not work staying long in one place. Developers have added this system in order to speed up the game process: they do like stealth games, but don\u2019t like their speed.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>In the singleplayer campaign, there are 80 levels in eight worlds, tons of puzzles and enemies. The player in the arsenal has nothing but a pair of night vision goggles, so you have to rely solely on stealth to make your way through the levels. Clashing with enemies means instant death and start over from the very beginning. The dynamic light system completes the hardcore experience that is this game.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2012-11-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-19T12:40:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/341/341b452d2f747c3cf126cd43c392c450.jpg", "website": "http://www.stealthbastard.com/", "rating": 3.29, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 89, "owned": 1354, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 6, "dropped": 40, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 75, "suggestions_count": 259, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 75, "platforms": ["macOS", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Curve Digital"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Curve Digital"], "esrb_rating": null}
