Sometimes the result is just a messy (but hopefully hilarious) thing.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nInstructions.-\r\n<p>Player 1, W and S.</p>\n<p>Player 2, Arrow keys.</p>\n<p>Space takes you back to the menu. F toggles fullscreen. Escape closes the game.</p><p>On some browsers using the arrow keys will scroll the page, make sure to play on fullscreen or download the game instead when playing with a friend.<br/></p>\r\n\r\nDev rambling.- \r\n<p>The game has a list of 30 modifiers to choose from and it's fully random, meaning some of them might appear on consecutive matches.</p>\n<p>Some combinations might not work as intended, it's hard to take into account all the combinations.</p>\n<p>This was originally made for a showcase that didn't pick the game. Have this at your event and force me to add more modifiers.</p>\n<p>1 player mode is just a demo. It's hard to make a decent AI that will react to every modifier combination.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T03:40:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21d/21d78146abfe7a9731cee78db11b4327.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ludipe"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
