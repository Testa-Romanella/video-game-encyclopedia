Current idea is a pokemon game with a slightly more open feel and a stronger focus on collecting pokemon over battling, though battling is still a big part of the game.<br/><br/>When I\u00a0say this is very work in progress, I mean VERY work in progress. Currently there are less than 3 minutes of gameplay as I\u00a0uploaded this mostly to figure out the upload process. I\u00a0do not recommend playing this yet at all and I\u00a0imagine its gonna be a bit before there's even an hours worth of content in here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-27T08:28:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eba/ebac2a866d304c67dfabece56a550025.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Myewphi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
