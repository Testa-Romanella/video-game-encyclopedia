Free balls are awarded when certain scores are achieved. Levels must be completely cleared before advancing to the next one. Take advantage of the power ups (big bumper, multi ball, explode and enlarge) to help accelerate your progress.<br/><br/>At the start of each round a peg may be randomly chosen to award a special power. It will appear as a different color compared to the rest of the pegs. Hitting the colored peg will award a special power until the ball dies.<br/><br/>Good luck Mr. Ball, you will need it.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T15:33:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/783/7830cb6ee341edec35513c169fe2df34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Les Bird"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Arcade", "Casual"], "publishers": ["Les Bird"], "esrb_rating": null}
