You and the AI have a set number of characters. You fight until one side dies. The last characters to survive stats will be used to make the next batch of characters for your team in the next round. Each round you and the AI get to upgrade one of three stats. Speed.Damage or Health. There is also a chance you can get abilities which can completely change the game. Each ability is very unique.\u00a0\u00a0This is a fun game I created to play with my home AI. The game is designed to be as basic as possible. This is for two reasons. So I can update and create new abilities very easy and so the game can be played without much attention. I hope to update the game weekly. I hope.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T05:03:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a75/a751a6e7e928d4c518072f4033424d52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["itsjustoneguy"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
