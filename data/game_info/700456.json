Theme\u00a0Clone: collect powerups to clone the ball, the more\u00a0 balls you keep up the more points you earn.</p>\n<p>This was created with as a mobile game first in terms of ui and screen size.\u00a0All inputs work using both touch and mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls (I forgot to add a tutorial, but it is very simple) click/tap and drag to draw a trampoline and when the balls land on the trampoline it will be bounced up. There are also pink orbs which clone the ball. The more balls you have going at once the more points you will get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I did not have time to flesh out the gameplay fully,\u00a0I originally intended to make a harder gamemode lives based so if you ever lost a ball you lost a heart. This gamemode is just if you lose all your balls then you lose.</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>UI - Toon UI Pack -\u00a0https://zayndev.itch.io/toon-ui-pack</p>\n<p>Music - Hypercasual music pack -\u00a0https://www.void1gaming.com/hypercasual-music-pack-1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T10:21:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/761/761f21b406beee9eb756a18b05676185.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["WanderingDev_"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
