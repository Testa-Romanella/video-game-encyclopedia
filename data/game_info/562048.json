In this game, you play as a magnet. The game is a top down shooter/dungeon crawler game. The magnets that you collect in the level, work together to make you stronger. There are three maps, because I wanted the game to be a short (hopefully fun) experience.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T08:56:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d8/1d891a3394440014ffd810476dbe6827.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WebHeadGames"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
