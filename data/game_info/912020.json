The player is then given a hand of letters (including blanks) to play from. Using these letters, the player can suggest words to play, the program then does a binary search to verify the legality of the move. If the move is legal, the player is asked where they wish to place the word, scores are calculated and the game continues. No AI has been implemented, this has been setup as a single player game.\r\n </p>\n<p>Build files to try out the game are available on this page, source files are available on github at the following link:\u00a0https://github.com/GameDevChris/Scrabble</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T09:49:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70e/70e34a75d04e3343a1eb659f0e6cf2be.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Bodsworthcm"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
