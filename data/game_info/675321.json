There's no hope of escape or survival, so all that's left is to take them down with you.</p>\n\n<p>This is my first attempt at a twin-stick style shooter (that doesn't have controller support, natch) with a few themes of instability added, one being the floor tiles and the other being the 4 generators. Actually, it's my first time entering any game jam of any sort!<br/></p><p>I actually tried a few new things here. I didn't think before going into this I was capable of making a minimap, but I'm glad to know I can pull it off if I need to. I also decided as part of a self imposed challenge that I'd make all the sounds using my mouth.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T08:37:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/4693c28ece143412c97ff47b65c68aaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mistercheezymoon"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
