This is not a 100% faithful recreation, and the physics are not an exact replica of the physics of the original game.\u00a0 Unlike the original, this remake is solely single-player, but I may add online multiplayer if people want it. Also, there are no sound effects as the assets were unfortunately\u00a0removed from the game before I had a chance to download them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-05T02:41:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/289/28923261a168d8c644918d17de9e6ec0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["thebuddyadrian"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
