Is this a joke, a crazy experiment, or... a game? You&#39;ll find out soon enough, just try not to die first!<br />\nGet your pretzels readyYour puny squad is capable of much more. Choose your loot and transform the squishy humans into wizards, cultists, ninjas and dozens of other heroes, including the mythical stale pretzel throwers. With perks and class combos, there are thousands of ways to build your army. The man-eating cabbage will appreciate the variety in its diet!<br />\nCrush your rivalsIf you can survive the labyrinth, you&#39;ll meet THE UNSTOPPABLE END-GAME BUILDS OF OTHER PLAYERS! You&#39;ll beat each other to death and only one will be spared by d&#39;Spot. No offense, but in his own game he writes the rules!<br />\nIndirect combatPrepare your warriors and let them fight it out on their own!
