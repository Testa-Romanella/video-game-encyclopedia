I have wanted to make a 2D Platformer called Food-Wars ever since I was a kid. Since fifth grade, I have gotten into game development and have been playing roguelikes non-stop such as ToME and Dwarf Fortress, so in my final year of high school, I decided to join my first 7DRL!</p>\n<p>Movement:</p>\n<p>QWEASDZC</p>\n<p>NUMPAD</p>\n<p>ARROWS</p>\n<p>Numpad 5 and T to wait</p>\n<p>In the past, before my Senior year of high school started, I was a YouTuber by the name of GameDev with Drew... here's my link:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/@gamedevwithdrew</p>\n<p>Playing in browser does not allow for NUMPAD movement, and make sure to enable hardware acceleration. I believe it only works on Chrome as well!</p>\n<p>I have no clue if Linux works, never used a Linux device before!</p>\n<p>Sometimes my game AI breaks, but I just don't have the time to fix it right now.</p>\n<p>I would love to continue working on this game when I have the time, but being a full-time student and working a part-time job is taking up most of my life. As soon as I graduate high-school and get into college, I will have more time creating youtube videos and possibly returning back to this game...</p>\n<p>One week gave me just enough time to \"complete\" an entire game, excluding better visuals, inventory system, actual working AI, more items, more enemies, more levels, SOUND, improved UI, mouse support,\u00a0etc. I digress! I enjoyed making the game and tried to not give up the entire time! Thank you for your time reading this!</p><p>Unfinished Parts:</p><p>Inventory System, Multiple Levels, Saving System, Mouse Implementation, Actually nice looking tileset system</p><p>Known Bugs:</p><p>Enemy AI just stops sometimes, IDK why.</p>\n<p>Total time to complete was 14 hours.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T11:12:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/886/886dd96796b61cd27cfe1d28d4298cbc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["MassiveBreaker"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
