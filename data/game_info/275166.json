As in other number crossword puzzle games, you will be given a list of numbers (1- to 5-digits each) and challenged to insert them all into a cell grid.  Unlike other number crosswords, though, each row, column and box of cells must contain exactly one of each digit (1-9 in the standard game).<br/><br/>But the fun doesn't end there!  You may also purchase and play larger puzzles with more numbers, with up to 18 numbers (1-9 and A-J) total - a puzzle 4x the size of a traditional 9x9 sudoku game!  Or purchase a smaller size to practice.  The possibilities are virtually endless!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:07:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/caf/caf842c6d6b80c1647f1b34b112088cc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Clinton H Weir"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Clinton H Weir"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
