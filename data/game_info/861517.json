The main focus of this Project was to make a Game with simple Inputs and not too much complexity whilst still providing some depth.</p><p>It is not finished and I am still actively working on it!</p><p>I mainly use this Project to learn new things about Game Development and Game Design.\u00a0</p>\r\nWhat Exactly\u00a0Is Tiny Rogue?\r\n<p>Tiny Rogue is a very simple Roguelike where you move through a Dungeon, defeat enemies, find new gear and Upgrade your stats!</p>\n<p>You also only have 3 actions in combat:</p>\n<ul><li>ATK: You attack the enemy, simple.</li><li>DEF: You double your current DEF-Stat to block an attack from the enemy</li><li>PWR-UP: You double your current ATK-Stat for the next big attack!</li></ul>\n<p>There are also many different items that will boost you in combat and give you unique effects! There are currently 16 items that can roll with different stats each time you find them.\u00a0 There are also currently more than 17 Items planned to be added that will also change other aspects of the game, such as the shop where you enhance your stats!</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>Just download the .zip file from below and execute the TinyRogue.exe and you are good to go! Once in the Main Menu you can adjust your stats to your liking and dive right in!</p>\r\nOther Information\r\n<p>I hope to bring a new Update featuring reworked enemies soon! Reworked enemies will include multiple different types of enemies that will affect their Stats and can use special abilities that might inflict debuffs to the Player. This will also fix the difficulty scaling on the enemies being to easy currently.</p>\n<p>Tiny Rogue is in active Development and there will (probably) be bugs. If you find any please let me know so I can adress them accordingly! Please also let me know if there are any issues with readability or other things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T07:23:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/faa/faac332e0e8d84887ef5edd074a4f8ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PhantomPaint"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
