The Black Plague was a devastating epidemic\u2014causing revolting and agonizing boils that would burst with infectious blood\u2014that wiped out more than 20 million Europeans. Often spread through rats and fleas, the rate of contagion shot through the roof, especially with no modern medicine or hygiene practices to reduce the spread. Depression was almost as contagious as the disease itself. Europe was on the brink of ruin.<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 Through our team\u2019s creativity, knowledge of python/computing, and experience through our current pandemic, we came up with a game that simulates the spread of disease. With aspects of Cat &amp; Mouse, mazes, Slenderman, and Tag, we created a game where the player is a rat and is trying to infect every single healthy human (with the Black Plague) without getting killed. If the humans are uninfected, they will not try to harm or kill the rat. However, once they are infected, they turn into a zombie-like figure and realize the rat got them sick, then seek out to kill it before it spreads to any other healthy humans. Our message is to be cautious of sanitation and reduce the spread of diseases, since it is ever so prevalent during this time in everyone\u2019s lives. As well, several people are anxious about the pandemic, and such as what was mentioned during the orientation, this game could help people cope with the real world problems by simulating it via a vi</p>\n\n<p>Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Touch humans</p>\n<p>Avoid the infected</p>\n<p>The number of humans increases every round</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-04T06:19:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/69a/69abddd4980b0af647e7f03885b25290.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark Texfire"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
