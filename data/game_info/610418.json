It's a short story about a 14-year-old kid who brings their favorite bunny plushie everywhere. The player has the power to influence the course of events by making choices about what action to commit next, or which item they wish to continue forward with, from the perspective of the beloved bunny plush.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The content of\u00a0<em>overboard</em> is complete, but may receive updates in the future if necessary. Thanks for checking out my game, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-31T04:14:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb1/cb1ba36304512040bc5e9368d5280373.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["eden :)"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
