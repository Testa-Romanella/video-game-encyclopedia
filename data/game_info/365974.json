That's the twist.)</p>\n<p>This game is a 3D platformer where you control a cube trying to get to the end of the level. There are 2 levels, the second one being a little on the big side, but each level has check points that do save after the game is closed. You can pause and navigate to checkpoints that you've already reached. The game saves automatically. Sorry it does not put you back to where you last were when you restart the game.... but you can navigate checkpoints quite easily.</p>\n<p>The second level can get quite challenging at times, and although I myself have not played the game all the way through, I am confident it's possible to get through the entirety of both levels.</p>\n<p>Although the game is still in alpha, I've still priced it at $1. Why not free if it's in such early development? Even though it's in it's early stages, what is there so far I think is worth it's price.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you take the time to try it out, please leave a comment on this page and tell me what you think!</p>\n<p>Music by @boc_uma (twitter)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T09:25:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fba/fbaef970539f00bbb99907e78eb07ff8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SmoothEdge"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
