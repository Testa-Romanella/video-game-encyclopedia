{"id": 202307, "slug": "laserboy", "name": "Laserboy (itch)", "name_original": "Laserboy (itch)", "description": "<p><em>Laserboy</em>\u00a0is all about using reflection physics to conquer obstacles. Need to hit a button around an awkward corner? Fire your laser at the right reflective surface and watch it bend right towards your target. Problem solved.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the game sports a prototype color-changed mode designed to help players with Protanopia or Deuteranopia-type colorblindness more easily differentiate between important color cues (namely the changing color of the Laserboy\u2019s laser). While this mode hasn\u2019t been tested with colorblind players, it has passed tests using colorblindness simulating software.<br/></p>\n<p>In short, if you like lasers, cute things, lasers, platformers, and/or lasers,\u00a0<em>Laserboy</em>\u00a0is the game for you.</p>\n<p>CREDITS</p><p>Design/Programming/Art/Music/Sound: Nick Carbonara (https://neon-android.itch.io/,\u00a0https://twitter.com/NickCarbonara23)</p><p>Additional Programming: June\u00a0Hong (https://ides0fjune.itch.io/)</p><p>ADDITIONAL SOUND CREDITS: A few of the sound effects used in\u00a0<em>Laserboy</em>, specifically the background ambient noise and the sound that moving platforms make, were taken from Freesound.org.
