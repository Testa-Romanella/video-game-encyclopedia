Beat, loot, repeat is a prototype of an action-rpg I am working on.</p>\n<p>Currently it features a fully-built ARPG\u00a0skill system, which allows creating combat skills with nearly no restrictions.\u00a0 It also\u00a0features skill upgrades, skill modifications(for example, making a piercing arrow bounce between multiple enemies instead), gear and passives. Currently there's a single class with 9 different skills and 18 skill modifications.</p>\n<p>The rest of the prototype is essentially a playground, where you get to fight enemies and earn new skills/gear. The map is finite, but randomly generated. Your opponents scale as you go, so be careful.</p>\n<p>In the future, the game will feature multiplayer, several classes, enemy formations/tactics and a roguelite experience.</p>\n<p>I'm also looking for an artist who would like to try their hand at building\u00a0an arpg.\u00a0Pixel art preferred :) And no strings attached.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T05:09:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7f/f7ffe8b9e91624ad0a4c9b652e79b026.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Creeepling"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
