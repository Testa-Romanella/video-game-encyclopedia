It is challenge. it is growth.\u00a0It is a character creation game where, we the game designers, have provided you, you, with the clay to sculpt your dream partner. Once you've gifted sentience into your\u00a0romantic/sexual ideal, you'll have\u00a0the opportunity to go on a date with them. Just you, them, and some mediocre spaghetti.\u00a0Alas, you might find that what meets the romantic and sexual ideal...may not meet the Platonic ideal. Does true love await, or rather the fallibility of human's desire for connection?</p>\n<p>WARNING : All playtests of this game were conducted with a plate of spaghetti. We cannot guarantee the game will work as intended without spaghett. Please, for your sake and ours, enjoy some spaghetti as you enjoy the game.</p>\n\n<p>A game for the Global Game at the NYU Game Center Site\u00a0by</p>\n<p>Christine Carmack</p><p>Brendan Hoey</p><p>Becky Jones</p><p>Rachel\u00a0 Jones</p><p>Courtney Sanders</p><p>Emi Schaufeld</p><p>Corinne Stein</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:03:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/869/869fd3cd8905693780e1ad14c232073b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["EmiSchaufeld"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
