Don't worry though, balls tend to show up right when you need them but you will likely need to fight for each one. Try to keep track of who shot their ball, and who has been slapped. It takes 3 slaps to knock someone out, just like in real life. Now get in there and try not to mess this one up!Gameplay<ul><li> Whiffle Blasters is a Twin Stick Arena Brawler.
