This one has been written from scratch in Lua for the Playdate.</p>\n<p>The object of the puzzle is to rearrange the points so that none of the lines cross each other and none of the points sit on any line that isn't their own, or on other points, since that would be mathematically \"rude\"... or something</p>\n<p>Use the crank to point the cursor, which is a line coming from the centerish of the screen. \u00a0As you swipe it around, it will highlight each of the points on the screen. \u00a0Once the point you want to move is blinking, use the D-Pad to move it. \u00a0Simply move the crank to pick a different point.</p>\n<p>When lines overlap, the game shows you where they are by flashing circles at the intersections.</p>\n<p><em>Features</em></p>\n<ul><li>Puzzles from 4-12 points, selectable in the menu</li><li>Two game play modes;<ul><li>Time mode - See how quickly you can solve the puzzle. \u00a0Once you've won, the timer stops and that's it.\u00a0\u00a0You can still move around the points if you really want to.</li></ul><ul><li>Noodle mode - no timer, and it continues to check for errors after you've \"won\". \u00a0It's just so you can noodle around with it or whatever.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>The graphs used were converted from the lists of planar graphs available at\u00a0http://combos.org/plantri\u00a0since I couldn't figure out how to make my own arbitrary planar graphs. \u00a0That's just to mathy for me.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T11:21:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/159/15996d6ab011ed56036a46e9b16726f7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BleuLlama"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
