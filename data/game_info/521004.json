It's rough around the edges, but if you wanted you could make a completely fresh set of levels for Looty with it.</p>\n<p>Though this is a complete release, if enough people are interested, I would like to maintain the game after initial publication here to further improve it.</p>\n<p>I'd also love to engage a proper artist to replace the graphics (I created all code, music and graphics assets\u00a0myself, bar the treasure chest made by my sister!).

It does NOT replace that game, it is merely an homage to it.
