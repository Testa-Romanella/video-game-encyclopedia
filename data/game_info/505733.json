Press space 2 more time to stop the 2 wheels from spinning. You can choose to keep your roll and add it to your score with tab or reroll with space. rerolling costs nothing but adding to your score costs 10$. Each time you add to your own score, the house does too. If at any point you have a higher score than the house, the house pays you and you reset scores.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-12T05:05:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be4/be44518ede65f75c5265177defa4ca73.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RonojoyMitra"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
