Except its not empty, as it contains 1) an endless horde of his minions, and 2) a way out of there.</p><p>You then formulate your plan:<br/>1. Destroy enough of his minons to collect bytes (1 minion killed = 1 byte). Killing off minions in quick succession will yield more bytes.</p><p>2. Power the jump pad (your way out) with a quarter of a kilobyte, or 256 bytes.</p><p>3. Try not to die while doing so. Also, try not to make the Nexus angrier. He tends to make the background red and his minions stronger when he's angry.</p><p>AD to move around. SPACEBAR to jump.</p><p>Click anywhere to throw your axe.</p><p>P to pause, R to restart.</p><p>Developer's Note: Sorry if it seems rushed, because it sure as hell is.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-03-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc91b8a279d6664495e117abfe23940f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Anheurystics"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
