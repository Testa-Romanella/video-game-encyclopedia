You must find a generator to open the door, a flashlight to illuminate the dark bunker, and weapons to kill the zombies in order to make it to the exit.<br/>\r\nThe generators must be put in order and often require a password to be entered as well. The clues to this are left to the player to find on their own. <br/>\r\nGuns and bullets are very important, so you'll also need to find items to kill the zombies along the way.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-29T06:18:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8da/8da66ee310eff7c150b8acca72add8db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CJBNY"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CJBNY"], "esrb_rating": null}
