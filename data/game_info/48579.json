Androids, robots, and cyber prosthetics are just a few of the technologies one can expect to encounter in the vast and ever-changing landscape that serves as the stage for Fanatic Earth!<br/><br/>Chains<br/>In battle, consecutive hits are known as \"chains\". These raise damage in proportion to the hit-count. Experience and money also increase according to this number. When attacking with skills, there is a chance the target enemy will be stunned. In such a case, the same attack can be repeated with a slight increase in damage, SP is halved, and charge time is completely eliminated. Using this pattern is the best way to deal out heavy amounts of damage, quickly level up, and earn money to outfit the party with new equipment.<br/><br/>Cores<br/>These are a type of equipment with parameter enhancing and special effects. They are available for purchase at local shops, found in treasure chests, etc. A maximum of two can be equipped at any given time, some even allowing for multiplied effects with tremendous results.<br/><br/>*This game features some in-app-purchase content.
