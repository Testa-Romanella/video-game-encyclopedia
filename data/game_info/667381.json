After the end of the war, the soldier comes home to his families old estate and finds several unposted letters that were addressed to him. The game is simple: walk around your families old estate and find and read these unposted letters to learn a bit more about the soldier, and what has happened during your time away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>**DEVELOPERS NOTE**</p>\n<p>HI! So im not really the best at creating sentimental games and sad games, in fact I would have never created one in the first place had my friend not suggested to. Just saying that I didnt design the notes or the contents inside the notes, my friend wrote them and suggested to code them into a game. So thats what I did. Also, this game isnt really a full game. I accepted my friends offer at creating the game because I realized that it would be a good learning experience. I began to mess around with UI, note collecting systems, etc. This game is more of a expiremental prototype to learn something opposed to a full on game. Anyways, I hope you enjoy this terrible game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-20T06:32:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d5/2d570bd4a6d1bc10d1d646656fc05b4c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Yhemmery"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
