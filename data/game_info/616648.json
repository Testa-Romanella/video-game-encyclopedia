It is my first game jam and the first game I have released publicly as a solo developer. It has been so much fun to make and I've learned so much from it. Hopefully I can take these lessons back to my long term projects and apply them there. And a big thanks to Shadow Programmer for hosting the jam, and all the people who participated!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-11T11:26:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e18d7baf74c0e87d211168899f06ce34.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Malicious Intent"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
