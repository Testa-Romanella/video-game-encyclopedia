The golf course is waiting for you...<br/><br/>Tip: If you have good looking, but slightly big fingers, you might want to avoid the zooming out part while dragging and releasing the ball, or play the game on a bigger screen, like a tablet.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-03-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-03-29T03:30:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7d/b7dad0d64d1df1779b23c372d237a9e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["l2minigames"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
