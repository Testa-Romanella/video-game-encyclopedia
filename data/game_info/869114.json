The more I thought about my great-grandma's childhood/young adulthood, the more grief I felt for her, \u00a0and eventually I started sobbing.\u00a0 My mom remarked that I might be the first person to cry like this over her, and that having someone mourn for what she lost will bring peace to her spirit. These two ideas have stuck with me ever since: the concept of being the \"first to mourn\", and the concept that having someone take pity on you, even after your passing, is important.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-21T13:04:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40e/40e24fe2297e5b02d943197dd0cb6476.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nyusha"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
