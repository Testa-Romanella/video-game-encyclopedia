Constricted VR is a fully immersive Escape-The-Room style game exclusively for the HTC Vive. Beginning in a central hub, you can select from multiple different escape rooms with varying themes and puzzles. Some rooms are more difficult than others. From the basement of a psychopath to a mysterious hallway, the environments are always going to be different and exciting. Please note that this game is not meant to be easy, so you must use every ounce of your deductive skills to escape each room! <br/><br/>If you want to help fund or comment on development, please visit my website (http://www.pnxdesigns.com). As a final note, I want to give a sincere thank you to everybody who does play my game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3d/f3da8ca821890f4b55afc5aa41357c8a.jpg", "website": "http://www.pnxdesigns.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 104, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PNxDesigns"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PNxDesigns"], "esrb_rating": null}
