Use <strong>(WASD) </strong>to move around and <strong>(Space)</strong> to kick the ball.<br/><br/>If the player is out of control, the controls switch. So make sure to switch around the mouse and keyboard too!<br/>Player 2 can make it hard for the other player to maintain control, by <strong>(left click)</strong> to build Canons or <strong>(right click)</strong> to build a wall. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T12:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ad/3adffd6f771559010c1bc0ea31b0de29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Joophaha"], "genres": ["Sports", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
