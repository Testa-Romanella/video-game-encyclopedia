Pickup the Green Blocks</p>\n<p>2. Avoid the Red Blocks<br/></p>\n<p>3. Avoid the edge of the map</p>\n<p>But with simple rules comes complications... as you grow and evolve it will become much harder for you to survive as more and more obstacles block your path! But, with a bit of practice you will LEARN to survive in this new world and evolve more than ever before!</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD - Move around</p>\n<p>Mouse Click - Press Button</p>\n\n<p>This project was made by me (The Programming Juvenile)\u00a0and a good friend\u00a0during a 2 Day Game Dev Face-off against Brackitstudios! We were all faced with a tough game theme... EVOLVE! So, over the 2 days we all did not stop working! And in the end I\u00a0am proud of the final product.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Of course, this is just a prototype game and there are so many things that can be improved and probably thousands of bugs to fix but I'm happy with how it turned out. If your interested in how this game was made then definitely check out the video I\u00a0made all about it on \"The Programming Juvenile\"\u00a0YouTube Channel! Also, check out the \"BrackitStudios\" for more on his side of the story and of course to see what he managed to make in these two days.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you enjoyed playing this game or are interested in the channel then be sure to join The Programming Juvenile Community Discord which you will find a link to on my YouTube channel! I am definitely thinking about continuing to work on this game in the future so any feedback would be highly appreciated!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Edit:</p>\n<p>Make sure to play BrackitStudios's game here...\u00a0https://brackitstudios.itch.io/gr-o.<br/>After you have played both games we would highly appreciate it if you would jump onto the poll and choose your favorite to decide who WINS the two day face-off!!!</p>\n<p>Vote here:\u00a0http://www.strawpoll.me/19487385/r<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-06T02:38:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/618/61810deb263bc2fbbb2ca01111c22300.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Redman Games"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
