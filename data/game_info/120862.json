Not all deres are included though, because they might be a bit too similar or don't know what to do with them. You basically went into an Academy or school called \"Chatousen\". You meet these girls when you woke up from your class which is before the last one\u00a0(homeroom). You can do free time events with the cast (soon will implement feature). No sprites, so just imagine their appearance I guess.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cd/3cdcd8f73ce004f89f6af86e3c3ef1b8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["TiedwalkGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
