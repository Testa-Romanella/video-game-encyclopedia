But an evil Villain is walking from house to house to steel those loved pets. Until one day a hero decided to strike back...</p>\n\n<p>The game was created for Ludum Dare 49 with the Theme 'Unstable'. Our Team is composed by Nicolas (The Game Tester), Daphne(Game Artist)\u00a0and myself (All the other Stuff). We went for a 2D Jump'n Run with an mentally unstable super hero as a main character. This was our first GameJam. The Game was created within 72h and all the Art and Code was done by us. We only used the Audio from external resources.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>As I said before you play as a mentally unstable super Hero who is out for revenge. You have to use your powers (Double Jump, Forward Dash, Fireballs) to complete the levels and to find the Evil Villain who stole all your cats. But make sure to watch out for your mental state. The less mental health you have the more unstable your powers become. Collect cats on the way to regain some of your mental Health. Reach the evil Villain and punch him to complete a Level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Have fun and enjoy our first Game Jam Game and also our first Game as a Team.</p>\n<p>Rate the Game for Ludum Dare 49:</p><p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/the-unstable-catventure<br/></p><p>Leave some Comments below!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Move - Left/Right Arrow</p>\n<p>Jump - UpArrow</p>\n<p>2xJump - 2xUpArrow</p>\n<p>Dash - 1\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shoot - 2</p>\n<p>Restart - R</p>\n<p>Pause - Escape<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:21:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddb/ddb1c835aae8fdca0892ff6d50c864ea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["XSchaumiX"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
