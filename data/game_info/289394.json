You must travel around this hospital looking for clues to help you find out who you truly are, and what happened to you, and the hospital you woke up in. You will soon discover there is a real big secret that has been kept inside these walls, and you are not the only one having problems</p><p><strong>Note:\u00a0</strong>\u00a0<em>this game was developed for a 1 week indie game jam, there will be obvious flaws bugs, and areas where there could be improvement. I had a lot of fun and when I was complete I did proceed to develop the story further but have since then paused all development.
