Act quickly, though, or I might do the SLAMMING for you.\r\n            </p>\n<p><strong>PLANETS MUST BE PERFECTLY COVERED.</strong> We'll let you miss up to 42 regions. After that, Coloniser... you're on your own.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T03:21:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1c/a1ca7495939f6c787c5ede4958a0209d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Juan Uys"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
