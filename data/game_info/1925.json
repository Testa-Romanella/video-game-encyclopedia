It was quite the undertaking and I almost gave up several times, but through bad times and good, I&amp;#39;m excited this real time strategy game is done!  I hope you enjoy it and if so please let me know, sometimes when things are tough an email or review from a customer really helps.  Game on!<br/><br/><br/>Multiplayer is not supported on iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 2G &amp;amp; 3G, all other devices are fully supported. <br/>It reminds many real time strategy gamers of command and conquer, starfront, and similar RTS elements as autumn dynasty, modern war, and war of nations.<br/><br/><br/>Press Reviews:<br/><br/>&amp;quot;Machines at War 3 has a variety unmatched by other RTS titles.&amp;quot; - Nizulo<br/><br/>&amp;quot;The number of units that can be created is staggering&amp;quot; - Armchair General<br/><br/>&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s incredibly easy to get into, thanks to easy to set up games and straightforward gameplay.&amp;quot; - Joyviews<br/><br/>&amp;quot;An assault helicopter above, exploding, and a little trooper in a teal jumpsuit parachuting out.
