You found a very nice swamp, with running clear water and light shining through the canopy. You were feeling very sweaty and decided to take a bath in the swamp. As you fully submerged, you felt a tingling sensation creeping up your legs. Suddenly, a *chomp* came sharp from your crotch. You struggled to get back to the surface and felt your consciousness drifting away as the intense pain consumed you. You woke up at the rear of the forest with your horse, struggling to remember what happened. Nothing seemed to be odd, except a strange itchy feeling at your crotch. Ten years later, you were having a party in the castle with all of your servants when an injured girl from the streets comes knocking at the gates begging for help. What would you do?</p>\n<p>In this twisted murder mystery crossing the line between good and evil, your choices are pivotal to guiding you towards multiple different endings of the game. Will you be a self-righteous hero to rescue the damsel in distress or join the force of an unknown entity?</p>\n\n\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-14T08:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/15e/15e05af71431d195f517e3bf4d58e8a9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meemeemy's game design portfolio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
