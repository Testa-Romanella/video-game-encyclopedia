Even when the world is on fire, it's all chill right here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the very first alpha version of a game I've been working on in my spare time; it is a first person perspective game about looking for lost pieces of media in a post apocalyptic settlement. Right now, the core gameplay loop is established, the main world and several interiors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is still a work in progress but it would be awesome to receive some advice or suggestions. Hope you find this game interesting!\u00a0I want to add more on to it and hopefully flesh it out with a lot more gamey and narrative stuff.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:37:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f6/8f66b98aaa5ff643c1772918a19904fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 114, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MisterPassenger"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
