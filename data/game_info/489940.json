I wish I had time to make the file size smaller or do real improvements. Takes around 5 minutes to complete.<br/></p>\n<p>I had a bunch of shit to upload for demo day but I don't have the time to upload them right now.</p>\n<p>Have fun and leave feedback. I might use this engine in the future to make real content with. The engine does show some promise but I won't make as much with it as engines I already know how to use well.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-07T05:02:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ba/8ba62fcb858eb444a0ba390633df88d1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evilous"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
