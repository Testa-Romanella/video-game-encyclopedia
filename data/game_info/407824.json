To be exact, in this game you control the kid who's playing a video game. You can't stop moving your own body while controlling the gamepad. You sat in front of the TV and tried to play a game, but the TV broke down, and you can't see anything on the screen. So you have no choice but to dream you're playing in your mind. You explore rooms and find keys to go upstairs. (A flight of stairs will appear when you find the key.) You aim to reach as high a floor as you can. If you encounter an enemy in your mind you should avoid it. If you touch it without health (red block), it appears from the screen of the TV and heads towards you. You can block those with the gamepad in the real world, but be careful not to fall into a hole in your dream. If those reach your face, you wake up from your dream and the game is over.</p>\n\n<p>|How to Play|</p>\n\n<p>\u30fbA, S, D, W keys : move the character in your mind and the gamepad in the real world</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u30fbK key : jump (to get keys and health blocks)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u30fbJ key : hold to fall asleep (to start the game)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u30fbR key : Restart the game</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\u30fbesc key : quit the game</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T03:11:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea3/ea300743705605116df6f5c129dce86f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["mikyokyuji"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
