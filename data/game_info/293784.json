If you fight an enemy that does nothing, it will be an easy fight, but you might have to replace a good skill afterwards.</p>\n<p>Because this is more of a passion project than something I intend to sell, I consider the game basically finished in its current state but may update it some in the future.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-15T05:34:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d29/d293e224a56f9ce2e0da83dd0074d0a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dpplasma"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
