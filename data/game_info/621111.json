Onto transaction two. The balance sheet shows the total amounts including all of the previous transactions. </p>\n<p>Read Emma's commentary at the bottom of the screen to understand what is being captured in a transaction. You'll need those details to figure out what the missing values are. If you're stuck, pay close attention to Emma's hints.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it's useful to look back at previously completed transactions. To do so, press LEFT until no value is selected, then UP and DOWN to navigate the ledger.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T21:31:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/02c/02c9a61872a6e53090ac8c2f7e63b72f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["danjacka"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
