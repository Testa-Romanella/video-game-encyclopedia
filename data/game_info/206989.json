A badly made dimension on further inspection as well. There is a door that gives hope that there is a way out, but it needs... berries? to open? Luckily you got a direction stick to help you find them all.</p>\n<p><strong>Q</strong> - Locks/unlocks the camera.<br/><strong>Hold Right Mouse Button</strong> - Inspect objects in the world.<br/><strong>Left Click</strong> - Interact with some objects.<br/><strong>Clicking the icons at the top</strong> - Gain information where to go.<br/></p>\n<p>This has to be one of the worst games I have ever made. I'm just happy it's over. Learned quite a few things from this project at-least. Like making games with a single focus. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it for what it is.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cfe/cfe65469ca5b5672302c77c48a01d98d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["HAUO"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
