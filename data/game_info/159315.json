Shocking I know. Final version was meant to have many things such as, jokes, a shop, a final boss fight, a wall climb ability, and more.</p>\n<p>The original concept was a collectathon where you played as a Samurai and collected babies for an old lady with the help of many other \"Samurai\" powerups (that are actually things like \"french samurai\" which is a musketeer, or \"water samurai\" that is a blown up puffer fish). But time constraints and me not being able to personally work on the programming end damaged the progress we could make and bugs we could work through,</p>\n<p>There is\u00a040\u00a039 honor. Collect them all to unlock a canon.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>a/left arrow\u00a0- move left</p>\n<p>d/right arrow - move right</p>\n<p>w/up arrow - jump or activate glide while in midair</p>\n<p>s/down arrow - duck (hitting the jump button while ducking does a high jump)</p>\n<p>space - attack while on ground or air dash if you hit space while gliding</p>\n<p>q - after collecting enough honor, you can hit q while ducking to jump into a canon and fire out of it with space\u00a0(breaks game easily)</p>\n<p>I'm sorry</p>\n\n<p>Lead Programmer: Donald Will</p>\n<p>Lead Artist: Say Mer</p>\n<p>Assistant Artist: Evan Burgess</p>\n<p>Level Design: Evan Burgess</p>\n<p>Sound Design: Evan Burgess</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68b/68bf6c2e43f6dc684b6765a5134d98d8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan the Great&Powerful"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
