First, the overall anachronism of discovering a full programming language in Ancient Egypt... that still works! Also, the main characters filled with preconceptions about each other, will have to put their conflicts aside and learn to work together (maybe even become friends?)</p><p>Once again I bit off more than I can chew, and this is incomplete. You can play with the mostly functional code editor though, which I think is pretty neat! It just doesn't yet actually control the statues in game with the code you make. Also, I put a couple fun little dialogue beats\u00a0at the beginning just as a teaser.\u00a0 Even though it's far from finished, this was fun to work on and I think there might be potential to continue with this beyond the jam and make a real game. Michael's character artwork on here is faantastic and really builds the atmosphere of the game.</p><p>Credits:</p><p>LoparPanda: Code, Music, SFX,\u00a0Sprites<br/>twitch.tv/LoparPanda<br/>twitter.com/lopar</p><p>Michael Firman: Character Art &amp; Illustrations<br/>twitter.com/michaelfirman</p><p>Fonts:\u00a0https://chevyray.itch.io/pixel-fonts</p><p>Engine: https://godotengine.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:36:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5c/a5ca584be52d21826e92d74adbf88567.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["lopar"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
