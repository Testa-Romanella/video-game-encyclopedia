{"id": 778452, "slug": "hunt-the-beast", "name": "Hunt The Beast", "name_original": "Hunt The Beast", "description": "<p>It\u2019s a game where you play as a hunter who must eliminate a monster that roams in a farm but mystical elements will occur around the player before he reaches the monster. It\u2019s a FPS that is played with the mouse and keyboard, but it is also possible to play with the controller even if the keyboard/mouse combo remains the most effective.</p>\n<p>The player can move around the level, his objective being to advance to the monster at the end of the level.</p>\n<p>My goal with this game is to increase the tension and try to scare the player, or at least make him stress until the final fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To do this, I placed several events in the player\u2019s path to scare him. For example, a flock of birds flying away, trees or stones falling. But also paranormal events, like a tractor that starts by itself or bales of straw that catch fire. Like this, the player can panic and waste his ammunition. The player has limited ammunition so that he can feel the pressure. I have added ammunition boxes in the final arena, so that the player has several chances to get out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal is to scare the player and to make the pressure rise in a small game of a maximum duration of 3-5 minutes.</p><p>I made everything except the car. It was made by\u00a0 GGBotNet and download here, on itchio.<br/>Also, all the sound are free and comming from sound fishing.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T06:26:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/142d52b1d5f4eed02691e9d756eb0a5d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samuel | Weiph"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
