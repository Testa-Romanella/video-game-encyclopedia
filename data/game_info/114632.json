The truth is that Purple isn't real. Everything we see as purple in the game is where two different games overlap to create an illusion. Purple is a game about playing two different games, at the same time. One of these games is Red, the other game, is Blue. With Purple, you play both of the red and blue games together. At the same time.</p>\n\n<p>(4/2018) UPDATED!
