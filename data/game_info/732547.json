The goal of the game was to move both players to a certain location in order to progress to the next level. We ended up pivoting to a better idea where both players have to collide in order to win.</p>\n<p>The game was bootstrapped from\u00a0phaser-platformer. We used\u00a0Phaser\u00a0as the game engine and\u00a0Tiled\u00a0as the map editor.\u00a0The code can be found on\u00a0GitHub.
