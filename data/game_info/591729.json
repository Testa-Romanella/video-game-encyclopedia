You might be able to recognize ideas based on some of the other themes.</p>\n<p>I figured \"Deeper and deeper\" would probably be interpreted most as either something mining-like or some deep spiritual meaning. So I decided to subvert both of those and take it in a very literal-to-word sense. Each level is one level deeper in the screen!</p>\n<p>One thing I became pretty aware of during the Compo was that level design doesn't come to me easily, so, being a level-based game, this ended up being pretty short on playtime. Maybe next LD I'll try to lean more in the direction of environment design or big open spaces instead.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T06:31:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b6/8b6b9a75979837e02bd60bd18a4f7214.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Gorialis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
