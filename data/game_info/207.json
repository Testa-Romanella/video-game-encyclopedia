Plug into cyberspace, using viruses, worms, and exploits to steal the data before your signal gets traced!<br/> <br/>After winning awards on PSVR, Oculus Rift, and Gear VR, Darknet is now available for the HTC Vive and also INCLUDES A NON-VR VERSION for those without a headset!Features <br/><br/><strong>DEEP GAMEPLAY</strong>: \u201cDarknet is the closest thing to a killer app for the system... It seems simple at first, but Darknet quickly grows to require a lot of second- and third-order logical thinking, under what can be a strict time limit. More than anything else, Darknet was what I was excited to play every time.\u201d - Ars Technica<br/><br/><strong>CYBERPUNK HACKING</strong>: \u201cDarknet is the hacking VR game we\u2019ve all been waiting for since our first viewing of HACKERS, Johnny Mnemonic, or Tron\u2026 Everything I wanted out of a hacking game since 1995. The future is finally here and I\u2019m cracking nodes, dropping viruses, staying one-step ahead of security.\u201d - BigSushi.fm<br/> <br/><strong>GREAT FOR VR</strong>: \u201cWhen I dove into the cyberspace simulation, I lost myself in the illusion. My relationship to meat space was momentarily forgotten. And that\u2019s precisely what a virtual reality game ought to do for the player\u2026 It is the best Oculus Rift game I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d - DailyDot<br/> <br/><strong>AWARD-WINNING</strong>:<br/><ul><li> BEST GAMEPLAY - Proto Awards 2014<br/></li><li> FINALIST - IndieCade 2015<br/></li><li> GRAND PRIZE- Oculus VR Jam</li></ul><br/><strong>CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED</strong>:<br/><ul><li> \"Darknet is one of the oldest VR games around, and still one of the best.\u201d - The Verge<br/></li><li> \u201cEnjoy solving puzzles? Strategizing? Does the description \u2018cyberpunk hacking in virtual reality\u2019 light up your eyes like Christmas morning? Darknet is reminiscent of Hollywood's appalling movie interpretation of \"hacking\" from the '90s, but it's fun and engaging.\u201d - CNET<br/></li><li> \u201cCompletely worth your time. An interesting puzzle game where you have to hack into different computer system using an array of tools, it also winkingly makes fun of the 90s-era version of VR. If you ever wanted to pretend you were a hacker from the 1995 film Hackers, this is a pretty good place to start.\u201d - Polygon<br/></li><li>\"And therein lies the beauty of Darknet. The game is simple on its surface, yet it's filled with challenges that keep you pressing on to beat the next one. I thought I was going to play Darknet for 20 minutes or so to get a feel for the game. Little did I know, three hours would pass before I gazed upon (actual) reality again.\" - Tom's Hardware</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:16:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e47d2af62573a368b2288b3e44db81a9.jpg", "website": "https://www.darknetgame.com/", "rating": 3.43, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 54, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 3}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 14, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 179, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Broken Rules", "E McNeill", "Archiact Interactive"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["E McNeill"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
