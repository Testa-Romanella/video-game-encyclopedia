This time, he has his eye on the juicy, yummy fruits in your garden.<br/>Can you collect all of the tasty treats in time? And watch out, he has lots of sneaky and funny tricks up his sleeve.<br/><br/>ORCHARD is based on the 1986 HABA board-game classic of the same name, and is the second App from HABA, following on from \u2018Unicorn Glitterluck\u2019.<br/><br/>ORCHARD is:<br/><br/>1. diverse : realms for playing, learning, discovering and creating<br/>2. exciting : interactive, playful fun with Theo the Raven<br/>3. age appropriate : various challenges for children from the age of 3 upwards<br/>4. uncomplicated : all games are intuitive<br/>5. safe : no advertising or unwanted in-app purchases<br/><br/>Unlike the the board game, the App does not function as a multi-player game. Instead, the aim is for the child to reach his or her best single-player result, without losing the most important aspects of the original board-game.<br/><br/>ORCHARD is mainly orientated towards enhancing the child\u2019s awareness of colours, forms, and of course fruit and vegetables from all over the world.<br/>The child plays directly against Theo the Raven.<br/>When it\u2019s the ravens turn, he creeps a little closer, or starts one of many mini-games. This loosens up the course of the game, and creates moments of surprise.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-30T13:33:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5f1cafb9347ca6aed8580694bc76a51.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Fox & Sheep"], "genres": ["Board Games"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
