First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is not the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If you want to test this game, a free 15-turn-version is available at http://bit.ly/1D0r8St<br/><br/><br/><br/>Privacy Policy (full text on website and app menu): No account creation is possible, the made-up username used in the Hall of Fame listings is not tied to any account and does not have password.

The campaigns are based on the time-tested gaming mechanics TBS (turn-based strategy) enthusiasts are familiar with from both the classic PC war games and legendary tabletop board games. I want to thank the fans for all the well thought-out suggestions over the years which have allowed these campaigns to improve at a much higher rate than what any solo indie developer could dream of. If you have feedback about this board game series please use email, this way we can have a constructive back and forth chat without the limits of the store's comment system. In addition, because I have huge number of projects on multiple stores, it\u2019s just not sensible to spend handful of hours each day going through hundreds of pages spread all over the Internet to see if there is a question somewhere -- just send me an email  and I will get back to you.
