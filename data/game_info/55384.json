Its subsequent popularity saw it released over the following years on a wide variety of computers, including the Commodore 64, Acorn Electron, MSX, Tatung Einstein, Amstrad CPC and Atari 8-bit family. It was later updated and released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC..</p>\n<p>The game was written by Nigel Alderton, then 16 or 17 years old. After a month or two of development, Nigel took a pre-release version of his Spectrum code to the two-year-old software company A&amp;F, co-founded by Doug Anderson and Mike Fitzgerald (the \"A\" and \"F\", respectively). Doug took on the simultaneous development of the BBC Micro version, whilst Mike Webb, an A&amp;F employee, completed the Dragon port. Chuckie Egg went on to sell over a million copies and remained a steady earner for A&amp;F, who eventually went under in the latter half of the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The versions fall broadly into two groups \u2014 those with realistic physics (e.g. the BBC Micro and Amstrad CPC versions) and those without (e.g. the ZX Spectrum version). Although there is a substantial difference in play between the two, levels remain largely the same and all the 8-bit versions have been cited as classics.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1983-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:51:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/725/725eb1611a3a0fdb7777938b7ca519cf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 7, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 5}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 4, "suggestions_count": 282, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Android", "Commodore / Amiga", "Atari 8-bit", "PC"], "developers": ["A&F; Software"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["A&F; Software", "Pick & Choose"], "esrb_rating": null}
