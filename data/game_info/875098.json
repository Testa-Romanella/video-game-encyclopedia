The base structure of the game is in place and most of the gameplay mechanics are in but the storyline and dialogue still is being worked on and thus may also change certian aspects of the current structure.\u00a0<br/>The initial inspiration for the game was Identity, the 2003 movie.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Our idea was to create a scenario where the player would be playing in the past and being interrogated in the present and in the end realizing they are the killer themselves.</p>\n<p>There are 2 cinematics that were not added as yet. The intro and the outro.<br/><br/>As the game stands now it is nothing more than an empty game loop with the barest amount of gameplay content and could be considered more a template for narrative crime genres.<br/><br/>Team members<br/><br/>Aldana - Environment Design\u00a0<br/>Gloomy Cat - 3d modelling and art Design<br/>Julian Jules - Music and Sound Design.<br/>Anchorlight _ Story/Narrative Design<br/>Petraefa - Programming and Implementation<br/><br/></p>\n\n<p>There is basically very generic dialogue and there are no words or codes on any notes. I didn't use the bunker as yet. But There are three motel levels to play through. The reception part where you get they key to your room. Then the section where you find the body ( there's a note on the table. To complete the level just pickup the note and go back to your room and sleep. If you do not have the note then you wont be able to sleep. The third level is just the note on the floor next to the pool close to reception. Same story, pickup note and go to sleep. he the final interrogation will go to end screen with credits.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-04T10:12:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a14/a146c03398e9a2844fd3a99993068341.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Petraefa"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
