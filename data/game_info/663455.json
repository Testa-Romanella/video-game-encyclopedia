It's a 3-D single-player (for now!)\u00a0racing game created over the five-day \"STOP WAITING FOR GODOT\" jam hosted by\u00a0Terry Cavanagh. It is our second game jam we've actually finished here at Hotcake, we appreciate you playing our game!<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controller recommended for gameplay! Keyboard supported.<br/>(Note you need a keyboard to use the menu at the moment.)<br/><br/>Hotcake Studio will continue developing Sanitation Shifters t in the coming weeks until we feel like it's appropriate for a \"full release.\"\u00a0Expect Splitscreen,\u00a0Career Mode, Bug fixes, and a lot more content soon!\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Follow the game\u00a0www.hotcakestudio.com\u00a0&amp; @HotcakeStudio on Twitter</p>\n\n<p>Shout out to Kenney for providing so many free assets, and like 99% of the ones we included in-game.<br/><br/><strong>KNOW ISSUES (We did make this in a weekend after all...):<br/></strong>- Sounds not playing or looping at appropriate times</p>\n<p>- Static Mesh causing the Truck to bump.<br/></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Controller not interacting with the menu.</p>\n<p>- Settings not saving.</p>\n<p>If you find a bug hit us up!<br/><br/><strong>Garbagebeat</strong><br/>There was also a small soundtrack album made in conjunction with the Jam for the game in the time frame.
