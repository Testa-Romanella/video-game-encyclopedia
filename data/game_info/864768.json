{"id": 864768, "slug": "the-coffee", "name": "The Coffee", "name_original": "The Coffee", "description": "<p>This is The Coffee, a shooter game made for the Coffee Jam 2022 for coffee enthusiasts by coffee enthusiasts. The theme was \"Sweet\" and so I created a game where you are a person who has a big gun that shoots sugar. You have to shoot these cubes at bitter coffee monsters to make them sweet. You have to prevent these monsters from reaching the hippie that you are protecting. He can't have bitter coffee and needs it sweetened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is recommended to play the desktop versions and not the html versions since the fonts act blurry and there are performance issues in the html build.</p>\n<p>The Programming and art was done by Cybear Tron.</p>\n<p>All the Music and Sound Effects were made by Greg Edwards</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>1. WASD or arrow keys to move.</p>\n<p>2. Left Mouse Button to shoot</p>\n<p>3. Mouse to rotate your character</p>\n<p>4. E or Right Mouse Button to unleash special move.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>These Enemies are dumb and will only go towards the hippie guy. Although they won't attack you, you have to avoid contact with them since their influence damages your health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Monsters are:</p>\n<p>1. Flappe: A flapping coffee monster that looks suspiciously like a bat. It is very fast\u00a0 with low damage and decent health. It gives 2 score.</p>\n<p>2. Depresso: A sad coffee monster that is like a goopy coffee in a cup. It is very slow but has greater damage than flappe with great health. It gives 1 score.</p>\n<p>3. Cobrachino: A slithering coffee monster that looks like a snake. It has decent speed with the highest damage and least health. It gives 3 score.</p>\n\n<p>When you get enough score, you get some upgrades.</p>\n<p>1. When your score reaches 5, your gun can shoot faster.</p>\n<p>2. When your score reaches 10,\u00a0 your gun can shoot even faster and your bullets do more damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3. When your score reaches 20, your gun can shoot even more faster, your bullets do more damage and are faster.</p>\n<p>4. After reaching 50, your gun is very fast and the damage and speed of the bullets keep on increasing.</p>\n\n<p>When the special timer is full, you can unleash a special attack with e or right click to kill enemies in an area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for playing and best of luck!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-10T11:09:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/469/469583ce2b8323171f9d19e4a454c53f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["CybearTron"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
