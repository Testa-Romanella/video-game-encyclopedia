LeftMouseButton to press buttons.\u00a0I don't know what the use of jumping is except for using it as an emote.</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>You are trapped in an Evil\u00a0Doctor's, who has a weird accent,\u00a0bunker and you are a part of his experiment: \"You are not a Hero!!!\". What will you do? Will you let his strange, robotic words influence your actions or will you be a hero with the risk of him getting bored and killing you?</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>There are four endings. One of them is a secret ending. Getting some endings are luck-based as the Evil\u00a0Doctor will maybe get bored by your decisions and kill you. The game will close itself if you get killed. If somebody manages to record a walkthrough for every ending and upload it you can put it in the comments (Sorry, I won't put a link to it here... I changed my mind so you, whoever would make/will make/made,\u00a0will just have to put it in your comment).</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>This game was made for the Bored Pixels Game Jam #8 (2021). I\u00a0had a ton of fun making this game. I\u00a0hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Thank you for playing this game. :D</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>Notes about Problems:</p>\n<p>1. The game art could look bad (for example some art assets could be blurry).\u00a0The art isn't actually like that. This game was made to work for both good AND bad computers so the exported project probably has some weird art. Maybe I\u00a0will somewhen add a new version that has better graphics for better computers.</p>\n<p>2. If you find any bugs/glitches please tell me.</p>\n<p>Thank you for understanding!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T08:59:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f03/f0300ca854b4ba246ba3e4c16bfaf5a2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Hydro Dev"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
