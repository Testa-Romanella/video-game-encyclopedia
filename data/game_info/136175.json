If you are spotted, you lose. \u00a0The game is structured in level with complexity and increasing difficulty. At the end of each level, you find yourself facing the main monitor that allows you to resend you hard-won data. But you only have one access code. Clearly, you will have the choice between transmitting the data, and ending your party, or try to continue to the next monitor, the risk of making you spot. <br/></p>\n<p>Pay attention! And Enjoy!!!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0cd/0cdd30afdd161640e52ebc54ffaabf67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Urhkas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
