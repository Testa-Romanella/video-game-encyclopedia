There's no going back up, so you might as well go deeper.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>Gameplay</strong>\n<br/>Move the player right, left, and down to try to get as deep as you can before running out of air. Collect air bubbles as you descend to gain precious extra seconds to help you beat your previous high scores. You can't go back up, so make sure not to miss any air. Rounds are fast-paced, and difficulty increases the deeper you go.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls\r\n</strong><br/>Move: Left, right, and down arrow keys<br/>X: Change color palette<br/>P/Enter: Open menu<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T07:14:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fad/fad0f5e4b9343d304de4f78384e841b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Ryan Nielson"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
