I work on it as much as I can and I listen to my fans. Game development will be posted on TikTok and YouTube.\u00a0 Bug reports can be submitted on the Discord.\u00a0This is my first video game, I still have lots to learn and lots to add. I will need help from coders later down the road. I'm only an artist, coding is still new to me.
