The current situation of social distancing is reminiscent of that yellow character which is running away from touching or colliding with other entities of the stage. This creative response is a stimulation of our social behavior in the face of the virus. How one steps outside and finds themselves in the midst of a variety of invisible enemies \u2013 even the simple act of going to work becomes a threat to one\u2019s immunity. The world outside is full of floating germs \u2013 like ghosts. Movement becomes a challenge, and everyone else is playing the same game, but each stands as their own Pacman, and in someone else\u2019s reality, I become the ghost.<br/></p>\n<p>This game\u2019s interactivity engages the player into an immersive experience that resembles their current reality. As the pandemic forces us into a lockdown state, it has become a novel experience none of us were trained for. Needs like utilities and groceries right down to the simple need for getting a breath of fresh air are such that one cannot simply shut their doors to the world outside. The objective of this game is to observe the trends and patterns of the threat that Coronavirus poses, and to navigate the route as best as possible. As you play, you become conscious of maintaining your distance from the objects that threaten you. Moving smartly and playing the game with anticipation of achieving essential targets is the only solution. Reality and virtual reality amalgamate into one. The objective and the experience remains the same, whether you navigate the game literally or through the screen.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:22:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/496/49650b1214c43a34f97a28610ddeca71.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Arsalan Nasir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
