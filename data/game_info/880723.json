I originally made it for iOS, but that is long gone cause 32-bit death, I\u00a0found the win32 executable, still works on Windows 11 so here it is, for free, don't judge pls :)</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>I\u00a0made this game entirely on a notepad and then scanned everything, it was a fun process for a gamejam game. If the game doesn't start try checking the GameDependencies folder inside the zip.</p>\n<p>Below is the original text and images I\u00a0wrote when finishing it back 2021.

It\u2019s been a long time that I had the chance to work on a small prototype or a 48H competition because of my work on Dary\u2019s Legend so I decided to stop for a couple of days and do something else.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Also my cat\u2019s been quite sick, and between the Vet and taking care of him, working on a fun project gave me more time do everything.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Since I love shump games I decided to do one. The idea is simple, you are in a arena with your ship and you just blast enemies away.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Initially I worked around 6-8hours on this back in August but had to drop it because of some much other work I had, so it wasn\u2019t until this monday I grabbed it again.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>I decided to make the game for iOS because it\u2019s easier to make prototypes there and I can carry them around everywhere, playing them, to see if they are any good.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Actually the first 8 hours where quite productive and this is what I had after that time:\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>So during these past 5 days I polished it a little, grabbed myself a notepad and hand-drawn everything. It\u2019s not much artistic, but I\u2019m not a designer.<br/>Had a few problems with iOS 6 due to some deprecated stuff but in the end it all fall into place.<br/>Also some tweaks performance-wise on the Engine where made since with a lot of stuff on screen things can get out of control pretty easily specially on these portable devices.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>iPhone 5 just came out and I even took the time to add support for those extra pixels, actually I just increased the viewport, no scaling.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>I probably named it poorly but it\u2019s\u00a0<strong>Puwang</strong>.\r\n</em></p>\n<p><em>\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T12:25:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c58/c5869447a2ecd086b987fa329dd7319f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["David Amador"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
