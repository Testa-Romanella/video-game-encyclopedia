A series of sustained uprisings have toppled dictators and transformed society since the invention of Internet. Making political points and taking others\u2019 perspectives online, people could strongly feel the impact of Internet on politics when they are engaging with the topics. Sign, usually street sign, is not only a symbol of safety instruction, but also representing the rules set up by authorities. Rebellion, uprising, or insurrection is a refusal of obedience or order.</p>\n<p>Inspired by ordinary street signs, CYBELLION is a site-specific AR Project. The six signs of the project are designed based on Australian Safety Signs. With the mobile device, audience can see a series of animation showing actions of breaking rules against the signs. Rules as well as authorities are being challenged because of the growing resistance forces online. Audience could experience breaking the rules through CYBELLION.
