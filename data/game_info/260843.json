Fortunately, they seem really bad at combat\r\nand prefer to use their bare hands to kill us. Either their really cocky or haven't invented laser pistols. Or maybe didn't have the resources to\r\ndo so. Since it seems like there are an infinite amount comming at you!\r\nAnd it doesn't seem like you're going to last 10 minutes. As a last ditch effort, you build barricades and you do all you can to stop these aliens from getting to you. You have a pistol and some cash to buy some ammo (A), restore health (S), and repair barricades (D). You'll gain some more cash once you kill some. Good luck!<br/></p>\n<p>HOW TO PLAY:</p>\n<p>Arrow Keys (&lt;- -&gt; /\\ \\/) to Move the Player<br/>Z = JUMP<br/>X = SHOOT<br/>A = BUY AMMO ($100)<br/>S = RESTORE HEALTH ($100)<br/>D = REPAIR REMAINING BARRICADES ($200)</p>\n<p>Everytime you run out of bullets in a magazine,<br/>you're reloading. It takes a few seconds to reload.</p>\n<p>You gain $5 from killing Aliens.</p>\n<p>Once a barricade is destroyed, it can't come back.</p><p>OTHER STUFF:</p>\n<p>This is my first game I made myself. Meant for Bite Sized Horror Game<br/>Jam 2018 which is also the first game jam I'm attending.</p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or experience any crahing, notify me in the comments on the itch.io page.</p>\n<p>You can redistribute the game however you like.
