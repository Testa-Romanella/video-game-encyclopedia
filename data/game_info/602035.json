A while ago Iestyn came up with the idea for this game, and thought out all the fighters and their stats on paper. After playing it a couple of times, he asked if I could make a game out of it. At the time I had only just completed my first game, but I wanted to give it a go. After some breaks due to other projects, the game was mainly finished and Iestyn started on the music and sound effects.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now it's done, our first game as a team!</p>\n<p><strong>We hope you enjoy it.</strong>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:14:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f7e/f7edef2c038580014d35b3f3104e3c1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Last Angle Studio"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
