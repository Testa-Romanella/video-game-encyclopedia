It is the result of a two-week school assignment aiming at creating a game based on a movie or series. </p><p>\r\n\tOur choice landed on \"Dexter's Laboratory\", a common fav amongst the team and a good <em>madeleine</em> for all of us.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAll graphical assets were created from scratch staying as close as possible to the original feeling. Sounds and jingles from the series have been used, but a good remix of the main theme awaits you during the gaming session. Everything was finally wrapped up with Construct 2.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tHope you have fun playing this game, as we had a great deal while creating it!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tCheers.</p><p>\n<strong><em>DISCLAMER : THIS GAME IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CARTOON NETWORK,  IT'S JUST A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT.
