The idea and 95% of the code in the final product are of my own design and creation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We made a simple arcade-styled score-based game where you must use a metal detector to search for buried treasures within a time limit. The version playable in-browser is the version of the game that was submitted for the Game Jam, but if this game receives any future updates, they will be accessible from a download link for a standalone executable.
