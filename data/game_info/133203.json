Been doing it for years. So I would like to share what we old timers played back in the days BEFORE there was windows or mice :-)</p>\n<p>This is my first release of a game (one that I actually finished). It is NOT polished at all, and looking for some ideas to make it more exciting. Will also be working on an achievement section. I have zero plans for multi-player. I may write a similar game that can accommodate such an en-devour, however, this is too small of a game to do that.</p>\n<p>Very special thanks to those that make a donation. Every Red Bull helps keep me awake to work on it.</p>\n<p>I know this game does not appeal to all, as there is not really any eye-candy to speak of, but it is a niche that I enjoy!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers all!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa4/aa42bc9fe49fd932f9b6d8a9927c8468.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ra7en"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
