With their respective missile silos, they will now launch and steer Home-ing Missiles directly to spawn houses around dudes.</p>\n<p>Even though they are homeless, dudes are picky and will refuse to live in any house of unmatching color. When placed in a house of a matching color however, they will award points.</p>\n<p>Missiles have limited fuel before they tumble down into the planet uncontrollably. Fuel is depleted slowly over time when flying. There is also a boost however that will deplete fuel fast. Controllable with keyboard/joystick/controller/mouse.</p>\n<p>Made during\u00a0Global Game Jam 2019, on the\u00a0LiU Game Jam\u00a0site, based on the theme\u00a0<em>What home means to you</em><em>.</em><br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard\r\n<p><strong>Force-quit game</strong> | Alt + F4\u00a0<strong>[</strong><strong>NOTE: Not in the browser version!]</strong><br/></p>\r\nPlayer 1\r\n<p><strong>Launch/Boost </strong>| Space<br/><strong>Look around/</strong><strong>Steer </strong>| W, A, S, D</p>\r\nPlayer 2\r\n<p><strong>Launch/Boost\u00a0</strong>| Enter<br/><strong>Look around/</strong><strong>Steer\u00a0</strong>| Arrow keys</p>\r\nMouse (Player 2)\r\n<p><strong>Launch/Boost\u00a0</strong>| Left mouse click<br/><strong>Look around/Steer</strong>\u00a0| Mouse movement</p>\r\nXbox 360 controller\r\n<p><strong>Launch/Boost\u00a0</strong>| A<br/><strong>Look around/Steer</strong>\u00a0| Left thumb stick</p>\r\nJoystick\r\n<p><strong>Launch/Boost\u00a0</strong>| Button 1<br/><strong>Look around/Steer</strong>\u00a0| Joystick tilting</p>\r\nCredits\r\n\n<strong>Axel Nordanskog</strong>programming, 3D modelling<strong>Erik Mans\u00e9n</strong>programming,\u00a0UI, planet look-around<strong>Frans Skarman</strong>programming,\u00a0missile physics, rocket trails<strong>Joakim Nilsson</strong>programming,\u00a0environmental visuals", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-29T06:32:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cec/cec6a53913be6b81af8e7872c1c88941.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Axerosh", "Jojoje", "TheZoq2"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
