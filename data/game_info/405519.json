Their final test will be to send a rat on the moon. They now have to identify the strongest candidate.</p>\n<p>You and your friends\u00a0will be pit against each other in a collection of fast paced physical tests. The winner will be sent to the moon!</p>\n<p>We've always loved local multiplayer games and minigames, so we decided to make our own. This prototype was developed in 2 weeks for the Lunar New Year jam by the Society of Play. Nearly all assets were created during those two weeks, with the exception of a few sound effects. This game draws heavy inspiration from a title we loved growing up,\u00a0Fuzion Frenzy, as well as other local multiplayer games that have marked our spirits.</p>\n<p>Each mini-game will grant the winner 1 point. Every 5 rounds, the score is shown. After a player has reached 10 points, the player with the most points\u00a0will be selected to go on the moon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-20T03:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80d/80dc9eae33b4730216665acf04d3ab83.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eddbag", "learz"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
