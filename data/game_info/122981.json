After pressing start the enemies will appear quickly. There is no need to worry about ammo. Don't be afraid of the white balls. And After you die, and you don't have enough souls to respawn, it will take a little bit of time for the game to restart. If you possessed an enemy, you'll have to self destruct before you can start the next wave of enemies.
