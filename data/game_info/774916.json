If the campfire's still alive and the players clear all the waves of snowmen, the players win.</p>\r\nControls\r\n\r\nMouse/Keyboard\r\n\n<ul><li>WASD movement</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Left Click to attack\u00a0</li><li>F to share warmth</li></ul>\n\r\nGamepad\r\n<ul><li>Left Stick for movement</li><li>South Button (A or X) to jump</li><li>East Button (X or Square) to attack</li><li>North Button (Y or Triangle) to share warmth</li></ul>\n\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Created by <strong>The Defenders</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Paul Cavallo</strong> - Asset Integration, Sound Design, Environment Design<br/><strong>June Ka</strong> - Powerup Developer<br/><strong>John Lim </strong>- AI/Enemy Development<br/><strong>Kiwon Song </strong>- Warmth, Campfire, and Player Controls<br/><strong>Jake Pauls</strong> - UX/UI Design, Player Management, Project Management<br/></p>\r\nReferences\r\n<p>Most of the game's assets are currently sourced from either Quaternius or cgtrader.
