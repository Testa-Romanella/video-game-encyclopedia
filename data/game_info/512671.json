Your worst nightmare happened and you need to fight the viruses coming using your logic operator knowledge!</p>\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Unfortunately I was unable to implement the tutorial I would like in the game due to lack of time. So if you haven't figured out what to do, here's a more detailed explanation.</p>\n<p>Logical operators - operators work as follows:<br/>True worth 1<br/>False worth 0<br/>|| is the same as adding.<br/>&amp;&amp; is the same as multiplying.<br/>! inverts the value, if 0 is 1, if 1 is 0.</p>\n<p>Let's go to the examples.<br/>True &amp;&amp; True this is the same as 1 times 1 which is 1 (true).<br/>True || False this is the same as 1 plus 0 which is 1 (true).<br/>False || False this is the same as 0 plus 0 which is 0 (false).<br/>! False &amp;&amp; True this is the same as inverted 0 -&gt; 1, 1 times 1, this is 1 (true).</p>\n<p>In mathematics we use parentheses to specify the order in which the accounts are made, in the same way it works with logical operators.</p>\n<p>(True &amp;&amp; True) || False, first we solve what is in parentheses and then we join with the rest, in this case it would be (1 * 1) + 0 this is 1 (true).</p>\n<p>The inverted sign works with parentheses as well. So if we do! (True &amp;&amp; False) the result of what is in parentheses will be reversed! (1 * 0) -&gt;! (0) -&gt; 1</p>\r\nHow Viruses works\r\n<p>All the viruses do some damage on reaching the computer. Each one has a special skill, for now just the trojan have already implemented skills. When the trojan reaches the computer he can open a door for new viruses or shake your screen continuously. Everyone has a text in the bottom specifying the logic sentence to be solved. Then click on the virus that you know the answer and move to the right direction, right for true and left for false.</p>\r\nHow to install\r\n<p>Just unzip the game files and click in\u00a0Dev vs Hacker Battle executable to run the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a64/a6446e85b920d0c5dfdb23ce11f7fef3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Riccardo Cafagna"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
