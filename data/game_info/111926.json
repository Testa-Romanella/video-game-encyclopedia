Each new run will give you different Abomis, \r\ndifferent areas, and a whole new Abomi Nation for you to explore!</p>\n<p>Abomi Nation is a land where no traditional animals live \u2013 only some \r\nsupernatural abominations known as Abomis. Something mysterious has \r\nhappened throughout its land, and all the native creatures have turned \r\nsavage against people. Some humans, though, realized that when Abomis \r\nare raised from birth, they can be taught to only fight in self-defense.\r\n So, these Abomi Wranglers try to raise a team powerful enough to travel\r\n to the heart of Abomi Nation, where they can find out more about its \r\nmysterious past.</p>\n<p>Abomi Nation is currently going through a Kickstarter to get its funding. If you'd like to see the game released within this century, then be sure to leave a pledge so that the developer can go full-time!<br/></p>\n<p>You can send any bug reports to orangepylongames@gmail.com!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Xbox 360/Xbox One Controller:</strong></p>\n<p> (PlayStation controllers are also supported!)</p>\n<p>Left Stick: Move</p>\n<p>A: Select/Confirm</p>\n<p>B: Back/Run</p>\n<p>X: Switch moves from your stat screen</p>\n<p>Y/Start: Pause/Show HP in-battle</p>\n<p>LT/RT: Zoom in and out/Rotate three Abomis in-battle</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong></p>\n<p>WASD/Arrow Keys: Move</p>\n<p>O: Select/Confirm</p>\n<p>P: Back/Run</p>\n<p>I: Switch moves from your stat screen</p>\n<p>Enter: Pause/Show HP in-battle</p>\n<p>9/0: Zoom in and out/Rotate three Abomis in-battle</p>\n<p>ESC: Toggle fullscreen</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to check out the talented musicians who provided Abomi Nation's soundtrack!</p>\n<p>Farm Theme by HelpThePoor:</p>\n<p>www.newgrounds.com/audio/liste...</p>\n<p>Cave Theme by ThatsVile:<br/></p>\n<p>http://www.newgrounds.com/audi...</p>\n<p>Wild Battle Theme by KillaMaaki:</p>\n<p>http://www.newgrounds.com/audi...</p>\n<p>Wrangler Battle Theme by Colton Pense:</p>\n<p>http://www.newgrounds.com/audi...</p>\n<p>Victory Fanfare by WarmanSteve:</p>\n<p>http://www.newgrounds.com/audi...</p>\n\n\n<p><em>This is an early alpha build of Abomi Nation.
