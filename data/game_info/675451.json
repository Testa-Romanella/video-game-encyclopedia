Today was the projected day for doomsday, where the asteroid belt would come to crash with Earth and destroy everything. SQUARE is the last hope of humanity, being a shuttle in which its bullets can vaporize any asteroid it shoots. Your goal is to go deep into the belt and block the world from disaster.
