Originally started through the UKGF's Tranzfuser program, and grew to receive further funding. The build that has been uploaded is a wholly work in progress build that we wanted to upload to drum up enthusiasm for the game alongside our social media. With this in mind, the current build of the game is incomplete, lacking full custom sound,\u00a0 with some of our currently sculpted playable characters not yet implemented, some minigame AI not functioning, and with a lot of features from the final game missing. However we still hope that this working verticle slice of ''Bin Chickens!'' gives you a good holistic impression of what the game can be!</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<br/>\r\nDirector:\u00a0\r\n<p>Clio Young-McGahey</p>\r\nTechnical Director:\u00a0\r\n<p>Josh McAvoy</p>\r\nLead Programmer:\u00a0\r\n<p>Eoin Peel</p>\r\nProducer:\u00a0\r\n<p>Eva Robinson</p>\r\n3D Lead:\u00a0\r\n<p>Sinead Burns</p>\r\n3D Artists:\u00a0\r\n<p>Eva Robinson, Reice Crockard</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Please follow our progress on social media!</p>\r\nSTUDIO WEBSITE:\u00a0https://www.auradigitalstudios.com/\r\nTWITTER:\u00a0https://twitter.com/BinChickensGame\r\nINSTAGRAM:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/binchickensgame/\r\nTIKTOK:\u00a0https://www.tiktok.com/@binchickensthegame\r\n<p>\u00a0 </p>\n<p>We really hope that you enjoy what we've produced, and we hope to bring some updates to Bin Chickens soon!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T15:34:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9a6/9a6fb2648f9321c6fbb42122fbc1368e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BinChickensGame"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
