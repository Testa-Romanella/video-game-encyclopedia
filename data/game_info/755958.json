Here, the world dimensions are 5120x5120, or the dimensions of a large Minecraft world on the Xbox edition. Unfortunately world interaction is limited: WASD to walk,\u00a0\u00a0destroy trees by clicking their base. Mobs can't be interacted with and move via a random walk. Occasionally houses will spawn.</p>\n<p>The world dimension soft\u00a0limit is because the world map is generated as the player walks around the world, but the array containing the world data is instantiated upon loading (5120x5120 8-bit array). It could be increased, but memory storage would increase exponentially. A better approach would be to store the world data as chunks that are generated on the fly and disposed of when not required.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T09:30:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2de/2defe9fe92791f816658dc4bd1dc4243.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 62, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nicholas Foo"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
