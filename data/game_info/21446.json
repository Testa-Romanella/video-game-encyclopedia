This title won 3rd place during the 64digits 2014 spring contest!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nPlay as Mayfly, a young girl literally snatched away from her normal life by Ferace, a humongous\u200b demon. Mayfly is weak and powerless, knowing nothing of combat, so instead she must use her wit and agility to get as far away as possible from Ferace and the mindless monsters that he warns her about.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn her adventure she encounters many tools, all of which prove to make for bad weapons in her hands, think about what the tools are good for in real life and it will all come together.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBack in 2014 This game was originally designed to play with keyboard and mouse, the option to support gamepad controls was added later on demand using Game Cube and Logitech controllers. While those can work the game just fine, X-Box360 and similar controllers has a different analog axis orientation which was not able to be tested originally when building the gamepad support.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-06-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T17:46:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/142/142bc0be03c9de954243a89ce2f36d04.jpg", "website": "http://fromsoysauce.com/", "rating": 2.0, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 16, "owned": 427}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 9, "suggestions_count": 277, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 9, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["From Soy Sauce"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["From Soy Sauce"], "esrb_rating": null}
