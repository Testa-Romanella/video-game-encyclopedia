The player character can spend different colors of milk using spells, and regain milk by draining enemies, with different enemies yielding different milk types when drained. The player must juggle weapons and dispatch enemies in a variety of ways to manage their limited ammunition. The aim of each level is to simply reach the end, but speed and enemies killed contribute to the player\u2019s score.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-02T12:39:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce5/ce589d365196d922df7624da8c76eb21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Demetri", "sean.callanan"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
