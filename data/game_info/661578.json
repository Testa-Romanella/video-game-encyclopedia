Set inside a now dormant universe of cellular automata, you are free to explore the \"ashes\" left behind, identifying any unique objects, or simply admiring the clusters and constellations formed by its varied \"still lives\". Each object has a category name that corresponds with those used by researchers, although the conventions are largely informal.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It should be noted that this piece is not a game(!), and that there are no goals to attain, puzzles to solve, or any storytelling elements. A typical playthrough may only be a few minutes, at most - best experienced when in a contemplative mood.</p>\n<p>Plays with sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T23:46:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b47/b47cb2b1975113cab7368b447f46cadb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["racarter"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
