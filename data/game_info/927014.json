In this game, you are a line of abandoned code finding your identity in the digital world. You need to fake the correct \"algorithm\" to trick each XOR (exclusive or) gate, to get deep inside the program until you successfully find root access. You need to rotate the cube to get the correct orientation of the other cubes from snap machines and make your shape match all the views of the detected gates.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T10:35:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/927/9275e6d541d515dbb2f7dbdce81066db.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["kfeng3"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
