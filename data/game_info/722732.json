It's a big one due to the amazing 4k textures and 3-D FX.</p>\n<p>It's a massive challenge and AFAIK no one, including me, has completed it in one life, or even one sitting. Play time is estimated at 3 hours minimum.</p>\n<p>Can you beat me?</p>\n<p>Ed</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-17T03:34:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fcef35511739e2938b3b421d3a19fd56.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamAMF"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
