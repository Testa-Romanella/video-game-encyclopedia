I'm a huge Splatterhouse fan, and for Halloween 2012 I decided to put together a kusoge/bakage shmup in a week themed around it. This has ridiculous music by Sampling Masters and myself, a couple of the funniest powerups I've ever thought of, and a ton of super fun graphical effects, including a super scaler-esque final boss encounter. I even produced a few hard copies to give out on Halloween!<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3e7/3e7dadeafffd8e1e5b78785a5b9189ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MuleNgine"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
