(No Rpg elements but a lot of weapons to grab! Sometimes you will steal the weapon of a defeated enemy! )<br/>Today, platform games (especially the metroidvania) have become like some open world games:<br/>gigantic games where you can go everywhere but which are often full of the same sort of monsters...boring and repetitive.<br/>I would like that the player does not get bored so the levels are less extensive, more linear but more varied.<br/><br/>Across the demon realm 2 aims to surprise  you in ways few games have before by introducing constant changes in environment, traps, monsters, dialog and plot twists!<br/><br/>And, the most important, you will never get lost in a gigantic level where all the walls are the same!<br/><br/>Use the keyboard or a xbox controller to play (I don't try other controllers but if it's recent enough you should use it! )<br/><br/>Credits:<br/><br/>Main creator : Choloco (some backgrounds by Ansimuz)<br/><br/>Music: Makimak and sometimes Choloco<br/><br/>cover: Shawli's Fantasy", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T02:53:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed34c138fbf1dd1fcd35eee5c006f98b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 357, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Choloco"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Choloco"], "esrb_rating": null}
