Before starting I (Peter) wasn't even sure if we would be able to make an object move across the screen or make a sound happen on cue or scroll across a large playing field, but for the most part things worked out. Maybe next game the goal with be capital eff FUN but at least we got something cute out of it.</p>\n<p>Coded using C++ in Visual Studio 2019 with the SFML graphics and audio library.</p>\n<p>Music was made using MixCraft 8 and original sounds recorded with an ancient Blue Snowball mic and edited using Audacity.</p>\n<p>Some sounds were edited from clips downloaded from freesounds.org, credited below...</p>\n<p>-Ducks from Chile:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/dobroide/sounds/185134/</p>\n<p>-Park ambiance\u00a0in Brunei:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/lionROAR0905/sounds/398904/</p>\n<p>-Grasshoppers:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/straget/sounds/401939/</p>\n<p>-A British telephone:\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/acclivity/sounds/24736/</p>\n<p>Also a major thanks to this Udemy video that helped me get started with making shapes move across the screen with SFML:\u00a0https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-c-game-development/learn/lecture/103281#overview</p>\n<p>Ok, thanks again, love y'all!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T05:53:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3c1/3c1aaaff6c9529abfbf5eebd4463df53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["stillPeterboy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
