You can collect powerups, you can move on top of ramps, and more.\u00a0 The game is <em>100%</em> possible! <em>Please read the <strong>bugs</strong> if you want to play it.</em></p>\n<p><strong>BACKSTORY</strong></p>\n<p>This is the 1st game that I have ever made. <strong>It's really buggy</strong>, but still really fun! I planned to make a boss level, but the code was just too messy. I have to admit... I gave up. But I have started a new, better project. This game is just the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>TIPS</strong></p>\n<p>You can play this\u00a0 game <em>solo</em>, or you can <em>invite a friend</em>, so that one of you shoots, and the other one moves. Try to move closer to an enemy to get a critical hit. You must constantly move, because if you don't, the yellow cube will probably kill you.\u00a0 And keep in mind that your rockets disappear after some time, so you cant snipe. Also, this game is hard.</p>\n<p><strong>BUGS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This game is really buggy: enemies can spawn on top of you, enemies are stupid and can get stuck, the numbers on the powerups can glitch out, powerups stack and there can be a lot of them when you pick them up... There is also a bug where you do 2 damage instead of 1, but I have accepted this bug as a <em>critical hit</em> mechanic (it seems to be activated mostly when you are really close to an enemy).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T07:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b9a/b9a0d5182810a36380f92c3dd2f3b510.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Attenon"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
