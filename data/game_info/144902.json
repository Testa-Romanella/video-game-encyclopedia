This wall is inscribed with 117 stars, each one representing a CIA operative who lost their life - whether killed by enemy fire or in an accident in the course of duty. This game simulates the uneasiness of watching him make that speech in front of the memorial wall, placing his words in the proper context.</p><p>Many people found Lizard King Drumpf's speech inappropriate. The speech, Orange Emperor Drumpf's first since he took office, was, to quote the Washington Post, \"a rambling, campaign-style speech, touching on everything from his appearances on the cover of Time magazine (\"I think we have the all-time record\") to Islamic extremism to the size of his inauguration crowd. He praised Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), his pick to lead the CIA, and blamed the media for creating tension between him and the intelligence community, which he repeatedly vilified during his transition and compared to Nazis.\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bdd/bddbdf32316a56da13d73b0c5dc794d3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["trumpsamerica"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
