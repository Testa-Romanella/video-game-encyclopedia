This was the first time trying myself out on a first-person game, and also the first time using a 2D asset kit for a 3D game. There is still a lot of polish missing that I hopefully will get to during the next few weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>WASD to move, E to place and drink flasks, Q to mutate into a ghost after drinking enough flasks, ESC to pause menu.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T08:09:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/809/809eb8477aadda46fa37e5b1c2e65435.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["gypynkt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
