The choices are all your own, for better or for worse.The Story<br/>The world is being thrown into darkness by the waking of the Dreaming King. With his shadowy tendrils outstretched, the continent of Asphal is being thrust into a state of disease and death. Reports are flowing in about a kind of \"Dreaming Curse\" that is bringing all of Asphal to its knees. The curse, as the reports indicate, cites that sometimes when residents go to sleep, they never wake up. Pronounced as dead, many of these people were laid into graves within the catacombs of local churches.<br/><br/>Reluctantly, the King of Anavyl called upon the Warriors of the Divine, a special group of four heroes that were blessed by the Divine, the last remaining holy spirit, to become immune to the Dreaming King's curse. Their quest was simple: defeat the Dreaming King and end the curse once and for all.<br/><br/>In order to do so, however, the heroes must first gather the necessary strength to face him. In their journeys throughout Asphal, they will meet potential allies and enemies of varying walks of life and enter the dreams of those who were cursed in an attempt to save them from the demons that force them into their slumber.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:54:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0b2/0b23025fb1c26912e06cd25e35368388.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 283, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foxless Box"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["Foxless Box"], "esrb_rating": null}
