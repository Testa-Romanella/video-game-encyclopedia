The game ends when the player collides with spikes on either the ceiling or floor.<br/><br/>Controls</p>\n<p>Use W or the Up arrow key to jump upwards.</p>\n<p>Use S or the Down arrow key to jump downwards.</p>\n<p>The A, D, Left arrow, and Right arrow keys swap between the two available characters.</p>\n<p>Platforms will affect the player depending on which character is active. If the red character, Gus Plus, is active, red platforms will repel the character while blue platforms will attract him. The opposite happens when the blue character, Linus Minus, is selected.</p>\n<p>Various powerups can be picked up to aid in the pursuit of getting a high score. More can be seen by clicking the \"Directions\" button on the start screen and then clicking \"Collectibles\".</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Gameplay: Dakota Hall</p>\n<p>Art Assets:\u00a0https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/free-2d-mega-pack-177430</p>\n<p>BGM: \u00a0Nicolas Jeudy and DARK FANTASY STUDIO</p>\n<p>Sound Effects:\u00a0</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/ultimate-game-music...</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256</p>\n<p>Font: https://www.dafont.com/04b-30.font#null</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T07:21:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0aa/0aa6f59ed20d644d34849b1a870fa6eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DakotaHall"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
