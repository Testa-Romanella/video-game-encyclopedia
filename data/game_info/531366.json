I created a tower defence game where the towers break down and you have to fix it for it to keep shootin. While its broken though, you can use your gun, which deals less damage, to keep trying to kill the enemys. The controls are:</p>\n<p>esc - pause and unpause</p>\n<p>w - move forward</p>\n<p>a - move left</p>\n<p>s - move right</p>\n<p>d - move backwards</p>\n<p>f - build and rebuild broken towers</p>\n<p>leftclick - shoot</p>\n<p>mouse move - look</p>\n<p>All the models and UI were created by me but the credit for the sound goes to:</p>\n<p>opengameart.org - for sounds and menu music</p>\n<p>https://www.free-stock-music.com/winter-nights.html\u00a0- for game music<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-14T05:52:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46e/46e05cebeb4bbba1071bd136ac1f0467.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mogo54"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
