ONLY tiles from the 8*8 Gameboy Style tileset have been used. There is also no game-elements, it is just like a showroom.<br/><br/><br/>*Dinosaur sprites not included in the Farm and Town Tileset, but are available separately <strong>[HERE]</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T10:29:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc4/cc4030adec30c2702806abc23812ce09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Teaceratops"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
