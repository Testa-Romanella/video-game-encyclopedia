Take control of the powerful Cosmic Brush and paint the world around you!<br/></p>\n<p>Harness the power of your brushes to create unique worlds.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Builder Brush</strong>: Shift, Copy, Paste, and Rotate shapes to your desire. Use bridging to combine shapes or merge them all with the Fusion Editor.</li><li><strong>Surface Brush</strong>: Paint textures onto your shape to give them interactive properties.</li><li><strong>Nature Brush</strong>: Plant trees or change the seasons to breathe life into your canvas.</li><li><strong>Element Brush</strong>: Shoot projectiles straight from your brush into hordes of monsters.\u00a0 Get strategic in a tower defense way.</li><li><strong>Light Brush</strong>: When the sun sets make sure you keep your path bright.</li><li><strong>Sky Brush</strong>: Control the weather to build upon your immersive experience.</li></ul>\n<p>Fire Monsters tend to get destructive when a shape is in its way.\u00a0 Put out large fires by conjuring up some rain. Your creativity will aid you in keeping your canvas together.<br/></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Purple Monsters</strong>: Tricky little Monsters have the ability to scale walls. Keep your distance and don't let them steal the Cosmic Brush!</li><li><strong>Earth Monsters</strong>: The strongest of the bunch.\u00a0 These ones have the power to break your shapes into pieces.\u00a0</li><li><strong>Fire Monsters</strong>: Blazing fast and annoying too. Get these little guys to simmer down quickly before they burn everything in sight.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Fusion Editor</strong> is an extremely powerful tool that allows you to combine shapes and give them purpose. Create elevators, flying contraptions, machine guns, or even a simple sliding door!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Node-based graphs make creating machines intuitive and fast-paced.</p>\n\n\n<p>If the <strong>Element Brush</strong> just isn't enough you can protect yourself within massive castles or reinforced bases. Mix that with a couple of <strong>Fusion Shapes</strong> and you will be unstoppable.</p>\n\n\n<p>Finally, expand your palette... Literally. Build a synthesis pool to mix colors together with ease. You can even combine surface colors with the <strong>Element Brush</strong> or <strong>Nature Brush</strong> for more exotic choices.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game is a passion project of mine. I would love to hear feedback and continue to build upon it as time goes on. Eventually, if things go according to plan I can bring BRUSH to many other platforms. This is in addition to the following planned features:</p>\n<ul><li>Online Mode</li><li>Interior Design Brush</li><li>Landscape &amp; Earth Tools</li><li>A really, REALLY large addition to the color palette</li></ul>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for? Check out the first release of BRUSH: New World!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T07:10:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c6/8c652b3f01567b45ea65c329d8089f9d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 73, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OMAGX STUDIOS"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
