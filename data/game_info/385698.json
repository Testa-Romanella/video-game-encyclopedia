As in 7 Wonders, players will have the ability to play cards in various ways: by paying their cost to put them in their game area and benefit from their effect; by discarding them to gain coins; or by paying the cost of one of the 4 Wonders they have at their disposal to benefit from the effects of that Wonder.<br/><br/>In 7 Wonders: Duel, players don't choose the cards in a hand given to them by the player next to them, but from a specific pattern of cards on the table, the structure of which changes according to the current Age. These displays only leave some of the cards visible and accessible. When taking a card risks revealing another one advantageous to your opponent, each choice becomes critical to the game. While players had to wait for the end of the 3rd Age in 7 Wonders to know who was the winner, the players in Duel will be able to impose their military or scientific supremacy to win the game. Victory through military supremacy is obtained by getting the Conflict token to move to your opponent's capital Victory through scientific supremacy occurs when you've constructed buildings bearing 6 of the 7 different scientific symbols. And, if no player wins through supremacy before the end of Age III, it's whoever has the most victory points who wins the game.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T04:38:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ec/5ec64e35273970b5f7e7e0a9aee5d50a_dZtSGdh.jpg", "website": "http://www.7wondersduel.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 135, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Repos Production"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["repos production"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
