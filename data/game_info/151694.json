YOU control the action by racing your horse on to victory!</p>\n<p>Use the <strong>Settings</strong> menu to choose your horse name.<br/></p>\n<p>Once you start your race you will see the letter '<strong>F</strong>' appear on the left side of your horse and the letter '<strong>J</strong>' on right side - tap the matching key to race your horse!</p><p>Sprinty Steed is an easy to play horse racing game suitable for everyone! It has a very simple play mechanic so you don't need to know anything about horse racing, but you might find it to be more fun if you know what a horse is \ud83d\ude04</p>\n<p>This project began as a last minute sprint the weekend before Melbourne Cup in 2014 with the original game being made in just 4 hours! </p>\n<p>Prior to 2017 it had become a 'tradition' to add a little more to the game in time for Melbourne Cup.</p><p>Now it's different - this game has brought me in touch with the high spirits that embrace the horse racing community. Although I'm certainly not a seasoned punter, I now know the thrill of the race and the highs and lows that make the community so exciting and enthusiastic! Oh yeah, everyone dresses so nice!<br/></p><p>I'm one bloke who has grown to love the races, and this game is my little tribute.<br/></p><p>I hope you enjoy it! Let me know if you like it!
