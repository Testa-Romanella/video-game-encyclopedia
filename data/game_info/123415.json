It has been forged on and off over several months of development, where school and work allow.</p>\n<p>It is a 3D first person point-and-click puzzle/escape game inspired by manifold garden, submachine, and many others. Pick up items, put them in places, use prolem solving skills to explore and progress. Currently as the game is unfinished, there is no specific *end*, although you should be easily able to find the canonical ending-room at this point.</p>\n<p>This is the first reasonably size game I've ever made, and as such, it's a major learning experience for me! If you find any bugs or have any feedbackand are willing to send me a descriptive message, please please do!
