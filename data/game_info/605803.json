Some of these feel still frames from some queer teen movie that was never made when I was a kid, others are more like behind the scenes shots. Music is \"Ion\" by Placebo, and one of the vinyl records  features an album cover from the same band. I do not claim ownership of either of these, but all other art assets were made by me.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-21T05:02:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f6d/f6d41cd42fe950e20aad442171dbfe90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 144, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beren Franklin"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
