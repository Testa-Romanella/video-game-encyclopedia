{"id": 100772, "slug": "tofu-tower", "name": "Tofu Tower", "name_original": "Tofu Tower", "description": "<p>Just outside a small town in the land of Welgaea is a gigantic tower, reaching into the heavens, filled with deadly monsters unlike any others in the world. The tiny witch Tofu Muffin (who is neither tofu nor a muffin) just wants to help people, and she's happened upon a town with a request. Legend has it the tower has a magical artifact in it that will help ward off the monsters threatening the city, but nobody knows if the legends are true, or if the tower even has a top! Tofu's going to have to collect cards, level up, and explore a randomly generated tower to see if the legends are true.</p><p>Honestly I just want people to play and enjoy the game, but donations are more than welcome! As is feedback! I'd love to continue tweeking and adding content based on what the players want!</p><p>I don't have the capacity to test (or really do much OS-specific support) the OSX and Linux versions, I've just got what Construct gives me. Also, Firefox doesn't have great HTML 5 support, so if you're seeing a lot of slowdown you may want to either download it or try a different browser.</p><p><strong>1.2.2:</strong> Anniversary update! Added a new card available as a 50% drop from chests on floor 50. Also made it easier to level up, especially leveling up cards far below your level. <br/></p><p><strong>1.1.1a</strong>: Got it to work smoothly on mobile, yeah! Play it on yo phones! Also got it to display WAY more smoothly in the browser here on Itch, no more jaggies! Fair warning the buttons are very tiny, so it's not as easy as I'd like to hit them accurately. <br/></p><p><strong>1.1.1</strong>: Bug fixed where you could play a card on top of another card. Bug fixed where holding the arrow keys didn't move you continuously. Bug fix to remove extra executables when the program closes.<br/></p><p><strong>1.1.0</strong>: Touch/mobile support added. Button added on lists to skip to the top/bottom of lists. Flat exp increase. mid-game cards balanced. Two new cards added: Return card which will return a monster card from the field to your hand, available from chests like the other item cards, and a monster card which is a reward for defeating the overpowering presence.<br/></p><p><strong>1.0.4</strong>: <strong>Tweeks</strong>: Help tab now opens with a click. Arrows move you as well as WASD. Text changed on the Life Up card. <strong>Bugs fixed</strong>: Can no longer select invisible menu options. Life Up card can no longer be used on cards in your hand. Dialogue showing cards collected from chests now correctly shows card stats. <strong>New feature</strong>: Trap card now displays AND DISARMS all traps on the floor.<br/></p><p><strong>1.0.2</strong>: Fixed a diagonal movement glitch, added keyboard controls that make more sense and do more (mouse is still required) and added a \"help\" tab on the battle menu that should explain a lot of things people were confused/didn't know about!<br/></p><p>-Naka<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9f3/9f3e7ccabd2c7652a5ff9d40b439fccc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 88, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Naka"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
