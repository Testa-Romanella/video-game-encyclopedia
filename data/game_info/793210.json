I did NOT get the game exported before the deadline. I had a lot of problems with exporting that day...anyways, I dont want my work to go to waste and im actually a little proud of it. So now its a portfolio game and part of a series I will be producing for future jams.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the game was made over the course of 3 hours, though im sure I have updated it since then. At the time of writing this, I planned to add sounds, voice-overs, more bad guys, space out the spawning to seem more random but also increase spawn frequency over time, some feedback/juice/feel,\u00a0\u00a0and add background objects.<br/><br/>In total, I dont plan on putting more than a total of 6-10 hours into this game. It is mostly a learning experience in comfort but is kind of enjoyable to play.\u00a0 :)</p>\n\n<p>If the web doesnt run right, the download will work a lot better.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Next Update Plan</strong></p>\n<p>Next update should have sounds, consequences for smacking the wrong dudes, and an annoying cat(dont ask). Also, best of all, you will know that a dude still needs to be smacked more before death. A little new to updating a game publicly, please excuse my excitement. Oh, and I will probably add some style and art to the game page(and title/death screens)\u00a0as well.<br/></p>\n<p>Im planning on updating this in the next few days. Bear with me.</p>\n<p>I only plan on two more updates. After those two are complete, I will be done.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-27T18:39:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e4b/e4b1e0572ed9c327bcb68a6940e9be1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["dunetap"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
