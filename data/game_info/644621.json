You see, you had a bit too much to drink tonight and you are playing darts. Your accuracy has gone a bit dull and you cannot aim correctly. You're so freaking drunk in fact, that you can't even <em>KEEP SCORE CORRECTLY!</em> (ngl that just make the game funnier). Note that the game isn't finished yet so its kind of glitchy.\u00a0<strong><em>Press space to throw a dart! Move your mouse to aim! You have only eight darts so use them wisely.\u00a0</em></strong>dedicated to muyb</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-08-02T09:04:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/106/1066f363546861ff7a1837fada97e100.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FireDemon119"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
