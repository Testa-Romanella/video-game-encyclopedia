{"id": 4473, "slug": "shank-2", "name": "Shank 2", "name_original": "Shank 2", "description": "<p>The direct sequel to Shank (2010). The main protagonist, Shank, is a former mafia hitman. His home country is taken over by a military coup led by ruthless General Magnus, and Shank has no choice but to fight the regime&#39;s militia. There&#39;s also a second protagonist, Shank&#39;s childhood friend Corina. She can be played in several story missions, as well as in a newly introduced multiplayer survival mode. Corina&#39;s abilities are slightly different from that of Shank&#39;s, her moves are swifter, however, her attacks deal less damage.</p>\n<p>The game is played as a 2D side-scroller. To move forward, Shank and Corina have to defeat all enemies they encounter, using three types of weapons: piercing them with knives, smashing with a club or shooting with a gun. The weapons can be switched on a fly during the action, thus allowing a variety of combos. The gameplay has slightly changed since the original game: blocking is not allowed anymore, and dodging is the only option to evade damage. Like its predecessor, Shank 2 features a somewhat cartoonish visual style, that contrasts the quite bloody and grotesque action scenes.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2012-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-13T20:37:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/a6e/a6e83e0f449883b6df57ae52b6805756.jpg", "website": "https://www.klei.com/games/shank-2/", "rating": 3.56, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 131, "owned": 2253, "beaten": 179, "toplay": 41, "dropped": 94, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 53, "ratings_count": 262, "suggestions_count": 560, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 262, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Linux", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Klei Entertainment"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Adults Only"}
