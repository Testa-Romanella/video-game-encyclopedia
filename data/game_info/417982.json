That's your chance to escape !!!</p>\n\n<p>This is a rather short roguelike game made for 7DRL 2020. That was an interesting week with pretty bad timing (one kid with chickenpox, the other teething :D ) but managed to do this little thing anyway. <br/><br/></p>\n<p>This was also an experiment to try out what godot could do as a roguelike engine. If I have time I'll try to expend this further. This could serve as a base for next year 7DRL hopefully :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T03:11:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e6/8e62f7341d9c7b12a150819acdf93488.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["StabAlarash"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
