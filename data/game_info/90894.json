It is a simple town and there is little reason for an outsider to come by. If ever a stranger does come knocking there\u2019s usually only one reason for it, they need Peony\u2019s service. Within this world individuals with magical talent choose one area to specialize in. Peony has a rather unique expertise; she studies the art of neutralization. With the competition so limited and her prowess so well known, it has become normal for her to be approached by neighbors and outsiders alike stuck in shocking and absurd magical situations desperate for someone who can undo it all. No matter how many unusual jobs she\u2019s hired for, Peony reminds herself that something stranger can always occur. And yet today she\u2019ll be getting a commission that is truly worth remembering.<br/></p>\n<p><em>\u201cGood evening, sir. Can I help you with something?\u201d<br/>\u201cOf course! Look!
