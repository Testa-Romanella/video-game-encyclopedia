You play as something(?) and must traverse a world of spikes, bombs and other obstacles, with the goal of\u00a0collecting the three orbs\u00a0scattered across each level, allowing you to proceed to the next.</p>\n<p>Along the way you will find enhancements, these are short-lasting but useful powerups. Each level has its own unique\u00a0enhancement that will be necessary either to continue, or sometimes just to reach an orb.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-18T07:55:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75fa4b892bbce334d30f337e94c83590.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["JaTYa"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
