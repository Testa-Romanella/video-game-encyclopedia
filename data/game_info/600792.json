There are no fish.</p>\n<p>It was made in 72 hours for Mini\u00a0Jam 79. The theme was \"frogs\", hence the frogs, and the limitation was \"only one level\", so I made a game where you slowly build the level up as you play.\u00a0I uploaded an hour late due to various bugs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTROLS</strong></p>\n<p>Arrow Keys, WASD or Left Joystick to move.</p>\n<p>Space on the keyboard, or A on a controller to use your fishing rod.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p>\n<p>A game by David Ford.</p>\n<p>Fredoka font by\u00a0Milena Brandao.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T12:35:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c0be2686e63846a8d7e014039efbdc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["DivFord"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
