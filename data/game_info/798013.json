This is Trijam after all ;). You do that by dragging the stone with your mouse/finger in\u00a0 the opposite direction of which you want to shoot it. You get one point for each plate you knock by the ball, and the points multiply if you destroy another plate with shattered pieces. The more cracked plates you have on the shelves the longer those tiny and helpfull shards will live ... Good luck in your plate breaking!</p><p>Music :\u00a0https://freesound.org/people/RichHeard/sounds/534373/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T05:11:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/442/4422232585e261e66aa6a750af75fef7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ProSmashy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
