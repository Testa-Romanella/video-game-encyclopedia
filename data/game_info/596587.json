{"id": 596587, "slug": "quadra-combat", "name": "Quadra Combat", "name_original": "Quadra Combat", "description": "<p>Quadra Combat is a puzzle/fighting game that combines the color-matching,\u00a0tile-clearing action of games like Bejeweled or\u00a0Columns with the character meta and competitive nature of games like Mortal Kombat or Smash Bros. It's easy to learn, hard to master, and rewards both wit and reflexes.<br/><br/>CURRENTLY, Dead Stuff Interactive is looking for people to playtest Quadra Combat in order to find bugs and generally gather player feedback. The game's basic mechanics are in place. Both solo play and multiplayer work, but the our Settings, Lore screen, and character select screens are still in development. We also plan to quadruple the amount of characters on offer in the game's final build.<br/><br/>If you want to send feedback, feel free to comment. OR, if you want to become more deeply involved in the game's testing and maybe earn a spot in our game's credits, feel free to join our Discord Server:\u00a0https://discord.gg/dedzfNVu</p>\n<p>To See the game in motion in its current state, watch this:\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T19:06:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0b/b0b67a8e6f72a970ec0187b3f9196f1f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 93, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dead Stuff Interactive"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
