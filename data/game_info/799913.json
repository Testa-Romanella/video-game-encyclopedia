{"id": 799913, "slug": "project-radiate-incomplete", "name": "Project Radiate (Incomplete)", "name_original": "Project Radiate (Incomplete)", "description": "<p>NOTE: INCOMPLETE (Made for \"Themed Horror Jam #6\" in June 2022)</p>\n<p>Made in the Unity Engine, this game\u00a0was to be about investigating a mad science outbreak on a dormant space station, absorbing different radiation levels by moving the ship around star systems and working around the effects they had on the different rooms. Planned with the structure of a small N64-era Zelda dungeon, the project is incomplete due to some overreaching ideas and\u00a0work obligations repeatedly impeding progress for other team members.</p>\n<p>As is, the player can roam around and clip through doors of the mostly untextured station and interact with one fully animated\u00a0enemy roaming the halls and rafters. The star map guidance is functional though it doesn't affect anything beyond the lights that show up indicating which of the three flavours of\u00a0radiation are being absorbed or cancelled out\u00a0(ionising, non-ionising and ultraviolet).</p>\n<p>To contribute ambience, the ship is very dark with limited visibility, a mask breathing sound plays on a loop at all times and ambient audio plays throughout over the top of it. In the screenshots tab are some unused models, pieces of concept art drawn up by me and a vector graphics\u00a0map intended as a guide to go alongside the moodboards and other pieces of inspiration shared on the team's Discord server.</p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<ul><li>Lead Designer: George (TheBonsaiTreehouse)</li><li>Unity Programmer: Reshi</li><li>Musician/Sound Designer:\u00a0Trevor (FaceMeltingSolos)</li><li>3D Modeller (Environments): Adil (Dukesmith)</li><li>3D Modeller (Characters):\u00a0Luna (Grandma Crouton)</li><li>3D Animator: Lee</li><li>Texture Artist: Carlos (Razor)</li></ul>\n<p>Those who weren't able to contribute\u00a0but will get a hearty salute anyway:</p>\n<ul><li>3D Artist: Gabriel (Froggity)</li><li>Sound Artist: Rob (Abstrkt)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-10T09:36:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/642/64209dd8a743bb0438ab27f76ec1abb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 164, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Bonsai Treehouse"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
