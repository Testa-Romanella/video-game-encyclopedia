You can cast a magnificent fireball, to light your way, vanquish enemies and keep you warm.</p>\n<p>Oh, wait! It's just you. I guess you can call that a fireball, having to go and fetch it every time you cast is not ideal, but it's something. Hopefully it will be enough, this dungeon is closed off with magic doors and there are fearsome monsters crawling in the dark. Good luck! You'll definitely need it.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>GMTK 2019<br/></strong></p>\n<p>The theme of this game jam is \"Only One\", so we created a game where you have only one shot to solve all the puzzles and defeat all the enemies. After casting the spell, you will have to go a fetch it again so you can keep going.</p>\n<p>There is:</p>\n<ul><li>One wizard</li><li>One spell</li><li>One exit</li><li>One screen</li></ul>\n<p>To all of you participating on this jam, hope you enjoyed as much as we did! GOOD LUCK!<br/><br/>Made by Jay Cano and David Saltares.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d8/0d8561102ce513c383e0369261b8a753.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["David Saltares", "Jay Cano"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
