In Stylobot, collaborating with AI means jamming out over the backing tracks that Stylobot himself wrote and mixed to collaborate on a new song. You can play along or you can mute the music to just play by yourself. There's no winning and no losing with music, just have fun!</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>X (X) </strong>- Hold to octave shift up</p>\n<p><strong>Z (O) </strong>- Press to shuffle songs</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse1</strong> - Interact with keys and mute button</p>\n<p><em>(Click on the mute icon to mute the music)</em></p>\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n<p>Stylobot is not a game where one can win or lose, it is much more so a musical toy than anything else. This experience is simply about having fun and experimenting with sound. It is also worth noting that every song in the game is written in the key of\u00a0C (sort of) and as a result, the white keys will usually go with everything! If playing along though isn't your thing you can totally just mute the music by clicking on the mute icon</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T23:58:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/929/929627c94ce596e0cc999ffaefa084b1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["alexhlocke"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
