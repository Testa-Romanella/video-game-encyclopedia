{"id": 821886, "slug": "upon-the-faces", "name": "Upon the Faces", "name_original": "Upon the Faces", "description": "<p>Submission for the GMTK 2022 game jam. The theme for the jam was: Roll of the dice.\u00a0 In this game, you are merely the plaything of a giant, as you fight for survival in his cruel game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT Press E while looking at the little black poles on each face to tell the giant to roll in more dice. As long as you have rolls, he will spend one to throw the dice again. This is the most confusing part, since the UI doesn't work on that element.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also get the small quivers and wooden planks to refill your ammo, and bridges. Left click to shoot the skellies, and F to build a bridge between the dice. Only build a bridge when the dice have stopped moving or you'll make quite the scene. If you fall of the dice, or if the skellies get you, its game over. Simply refresh the page to start again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>NOTES</p>\n<p>the skellies can only be killed once they've noticed you, due to some silly stuff with programming. The black poles can sometimes get messed up as well, so you may need to look for them.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T12:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/594/594f8a8e2d7d26ea5c7ef64c15722e4d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fifhyde"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
