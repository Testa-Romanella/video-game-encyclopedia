X and Z values go from -1f to 1f using Random.Range(). Y value is always 0.\r\n-A movement speed which determines how fast the individual will move in a certain direction. Goes from 0f to 2f.\r\n-A movement time which determines how long will the individual will move in a certain direction. Goes from 0.5f to 3f.</p>\n<p>The algorithm evaluate the performance of individuals navigating their environment using the following fitness method:</p>\n<p>Fitness=1-(d/D)+((speed)/ 200)+((Time) / 300)</p>\n<p>In which:\r\n-D = The distance between the origin point and the destination point.\r\n-d = The distance between the individual's last position and the destination point.\r\n-speed = The average of all the individual's movement's speed.\r\n-Time = The average of all the individual's movement's time.</p>\n<p>You can download the file to try it out or download the package from my github.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T07:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a56/a56405ce04dc6c96daaa9c5b076086bc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jes\u00fas Rubio"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
