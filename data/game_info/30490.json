Each of the four heroes has its very own set of moves and statistics, and starts the adventure in a different area. There&#39;s over 100 different weapons you can use in the game, each with its own characteristics that reflect on the fighting style. New special attacks can be unlocked as your character gains experience and power. While you slash and bash through the hordes of terrifying monsters, you will feel the urge sometimes to stop and look at the beautiful--if a bit gloomy--surroundings. If you&#39;re looking for a game that will take you on a fantastic quest filled with merciless combat, this is the one to pick up!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2001-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T15:59:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/8d6/8d6e253b996283f3244b7999472eeaad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.37, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 59, "beaten": 41, "toplay": 26, "dropped": 21, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 58, "suggestions_count": 500, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 60, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rebel Act Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Codemasters"], "esrb_rating": null}
