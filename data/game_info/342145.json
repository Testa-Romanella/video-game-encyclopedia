Since then I\u00a0have worked on several updates for the game, and now created a windows version. I created the game entirely by myself (music, graphics, programming),\u00a0aside from a few CC0 sound effects used in the game.</p>\n<p>This is my first release on itch.io. If you're a fan of werewolves, endless runners, or pixelated adventures, I hope you enjoy Hunter's Moon!</p>\n<p>(The trailer linked was created for the android version on Google Play. I might create a slightly different trailer for the Windows version at some point in the future.)</p>\n<p><em>Take on the role of a lone werewolf hunter. Leap across the rooftops of an ancient city in this infinite runner, and use your sword to vanquish the evil werewolves who await you. Collect gold along the way, always aiming to improve your score. Don't fall into the forest below, or you'll have to navigate a gauntlet of deadly traps.</em></p>\n<p><em>Discover secret areas and items hidden throughout the land! Once you've unlocked an item, you'll be able to spend your leftover gold from previous runs to buy it. Don't let the werewolves defeat you, or you will have to begin your hunt again.</em></p>\n<p>If you're looking for the\u00a0<strong>android\u00a0</strong>version, you can find it on the google play store. There is a link at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<p>If you're so interested, you can also <strong>buy the soundtrack from my bandcamp</strong> page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/68c/68c1097f61890d4dddaee24917465048.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SebWoodland"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
