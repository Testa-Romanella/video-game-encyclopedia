After locating a few bugs, I have now tried to fix them to the best of my skills. I hope people enjoy this short free game. It's designed to be hard, so it\u2019s made like a challenge. Maybe you don\u2019t get it the first time. But you can always try again later. Or right now if you will. \r\nIf you are out of money and/or bored this game is a great way to spend a 30 - 60min. \r\nChanges:</p>\n<ul><li>Added a \"wait\" timer in the TimerSystem to fix the FPS problem.</li><li>Additional rewriting, and fixing of grama and spelling errors.\r\n</li><li>The misstaken bug that made standard attack and block cost mana is removed.\r\n</li><li>Block now gives greater TP, MP and HP when it is used, making up for the loss of party members.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>Additional intro cutscene dialog has been re-added to give the game a little more story context.\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Disclaimer; <br/>This game is still made to be a hard challenge. So I hope it lives up to that, without disappointment. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T08:38:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6b7/6b7637fb6974679454580a09fbd08b50.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 115, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WarpEnigma"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
