I got interrupted quite a many times, so let's say that's three.\u00a0 Most of the time was used in making trace painting system, as this was my first time using render textures (viewports in Godot). After breaking and fixing the system multiple times two thirds of the time was already up :D<br/></p>\n<p>Theme was \"Don't learn from mistakes - repeat!\". I tried to make it so that the game rewards you for going same routes again and again. Maybe it's quite a stretch with how the mechanics turned out... After the jam I revamped graphics and entire setting of the game. At first it was in space, but I didn't like sprites I had drawn. Also the music, which was written before I decided on theme, didn't match space theme. So I decided to go with ocean theme.<br/></p>\n<p>Music by Mubsi<br/></p>\n<p>Font: Knewave<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T21:09:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d3/4d3622b24c24b59761a61e91c673728a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["AxU", "Mubsi"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
