Use your magic wand to create a beam to\u00a0obliterate them! After each wave you will have a choice :</p>\n<ul><li>Upgrade your magic wand which will increase its damage. Due to time contraints you can only see 4 upgrades (beam color from yellow to red) but even after the red beam (wand level 4), your damage will still increase.</li><li>Heal yourself (to full health, lucky you).</li></ul>\n<p><strong>How to play:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Move your wizard using the arrows or WASD or ZQSD (<strong>my advise is to not use arrow keys otherwise the page\u00a0will scroll</strong>).</li><li>When you left click on your mouse, a beam will be created from your cursor to your magic wand. You can then hold your click and move your mouse to deal damage to enemies.</li><li>Each wave contains an unlimited number of enemies but you only need to kill a certain number to go to the next wave. The remaining enemies to kill in a wave\u00a0is indicated at the top of the screen.</li><li>Each wave increases enemy speed and health.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<strong>Move wizard</strong>Arrow keys / WASD / ZQSD<strong>Create magic beam</strong>Hold mouse left click\r\n<p><strong>This game has been made in 3 hours for Trijam 166 (theme: upgrade your weapons) by Nicolas.</strong>\n</p>\r\nAll assets have been made by me during this Jam, except:\r\n<p><strong>Fonts:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Karmatic Arcade by Vic Fieger :\u00a0https://www.1001fonts.com/karmatic-arcade-font.html\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Musics:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>8bit MonsterVania Track #1 by HydroGene:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/8bit-monstervania-track-1\r\n</li><li>Game Over Theme II by CleytonKauffman:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/game-over-theme-ii\r\n</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>8-Bit Sound Effect Pack (Vol. 001) by Deva:\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/8-bit-sound-effect-pack-vol-001</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Sprites:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>16x16 RPG Items: 100 Staves, Swords, Books by PixelCreations:\u00a0https://pixelcreations.itch.io/rpg-items-16x16</li><li>\u00a0Animated Potion Assets Pack - FREE by FLIP:\u00a0https://flippurgatory.itch.io/animated-potion-assets-pack-free</li><li>GothicVania patreon's collection by Ansimuz:\u00a0https://ansimuz.itch.io/gothicvania-patreon-collection</li></ul>\n<p><em>Made with Construct-3</em>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T11:06:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/471/4712e4e5234bb0f9704d71170f2d3b11.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Shibaya"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
