When you remove your finger from the screen the sling will be detached and the rocket will start moving in whichever direction it would be facing. <br/><br/>You can connect as many times as you like. Make sure you don't hit any other planet while rotating around one. The side boundaries would not harm you when you are touching the screen.<br/><br/>You can also collect gems on your way which can be used to unlock new ships. There are 7 different ships which can be used to play.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:32:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be8/be8cd4733e4520248ded2a73e8317f8f_CCbCy1J.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Uzair Mehmood"], "genres": ["Arcade", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Uzair Mehmood"], "esrb_rating": null}
