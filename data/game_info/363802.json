They found they could spawn this soul into the world and it would materialize in its original body but instead of being 'alive' it exists completely on lume energy and is linked to the stone it was captured in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these captured people can be respawned infinitely unless their stone is destroyed, the mages threaten them with eternal torture until their will breaks and they become obedient servants. It is on the backs of an army of these servants that the civilization maintains a high level of underground luxury. </p>\n<p>You are one of these poor souls, not really alive or dead, but still feeling things. What will you do? Does freedom mean destroying your soul stone or being the master of your choices? Nothing seems possible under the boot of the mages, but patience will allow you to discover powers and unlock new possibilities.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-09T09:12:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fc9/fc98f84c35db7885860379649699bfa5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["what4games"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
