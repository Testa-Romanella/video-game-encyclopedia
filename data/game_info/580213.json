I know it's obvious but I just wanna cover my grounds here, lmao. This was originally made for my friend ItsMeMordred for her twitch page, so if there's some jokes you don't quite get, it's likely that they're a form of a call-back to something on her streams. Play time is around 15 minutes if you talk to everyone, maybe a bit more!<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>I scrubbed the game of RTP assets, but if you encounter random crashes or anything, feel free to report them in the comments. I recommend installing the RPGMaker 2003 RTP (it's free!) just in case.<br/></em></p>\n<p><em>USB Switch controllers work for this, as far as I'm aware. XBox controllers do as well, but you'll need to adjust the way Windows does XBox inputs and set it to be able to play older software. <br/></em></p>\n<p><em>All my music was obtained from the lovely MIDI archive on TheMushroomKingdom.net!
