You play as <em>Molly</em>, a fearless commando, ready to any sacrifice to save innocent kittens. Led by <em>Erwin</em>, you'll have to defeat all the enemies in the <em>Fox Base</em> to complete the mission you have been sent here for.</p>\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMade by \u00c9lo\u00efse Zirotti and Robin\u00a0Six in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 46.\r\n\n\n<p><strong>The game has been designed for controllers and will prioritize them over keyboard/mouse if at least one is plugged. You can still play with keyboard/mouse but make sure to use a controller if possible !</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>If you want to play and rate us for the Ludum Dare event, make sure to download the LDJAM Submission build. If you simply want to play and enjoy a better version, download the second one !</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T08:46:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ec7/ec70cfe53d1133933f1e9f2600e928c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Robin Six"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
