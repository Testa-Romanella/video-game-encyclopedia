Draw a line through 5 blocks, each of a different color, to clear them. Don't let the board fill up all the way to the top.\u00a0Comment below with your high score!</p>\n<p>Code and design by Tom Quinn.<br/>Sound and music by Jacob Ruttenberg.<br/>Best played in Chrome. Works okay in Firefox.\u00a0Doesn't work so hot in Internet Explorer.<br/>Source code available here.</p>\r\nInstructions\r\n<ul><li>Adjacent blocks of the same color will fuse together, making them easier to clear, but potentially cluttering the board. Clear them quickly to keep a good mix of colors present all over the board.</li><li>Clearing large clusters fills your meter; click it or press the space bar to settle the board and fill up those nasty gaps.\u00a0It also stops blocks from falling for a short time. It automatically activates if you're about to lose.</li><li>The longer you play, the higher your multiplier gets, and the more points you earn for everything.</li><li>More pieces will start to fall when the board is less than half full, and the most will fall\u00a0when the board is empty. Use this to score lots of points early on.</li><li>Multiple matches in quick succession will net you combo points. The longer your streak, the higher the bonus gets!</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e43/e43904b12f4d40a8ac182c9b398f3146.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tom Quinn"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
