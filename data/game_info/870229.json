{"id": 870229, "slug": "paraglider-brendan-keogh", "name": "Paraglider (Brendan Keogh)", "name_original": "Paraglider (Brendan Keogh)", "description": "<p>A silly little game where you can fly your paraglider, but you have to walk home afterwards if you want to go a second time.</p>\n<p>A little flag will show where you landed. Try going further each time!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>:<br/></p>\n<p><em>While walking</em>: LEFT and RIGHT to walk, UP to jump, SPACE to prepare to fly, Q to auto-walk<br/></p>\n<p><em>While gliding</em>: LEFT to pull up, RIGHT to pull down, SPACE to launch.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Context:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game was made for the second Squiggly River Game Collective camp-jam-retreat where a bunch of us went to a homestead in the country and made games for the weekend. The theme for the retreat was 'returning'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was sort of a disaster this time, as flooding meant half of the crew couldn't actually attend, and the other half had to either leave early or stay trapped for longer. Still, I managed to make this game over a couple of days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0made this game in Godot, and it is the first Godot game I have released. I have only tested the OSX build on my Macbook, and I have not tested the Windows build at all.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Character, trees, and house sprites from various LimeZu asset packs.</p>\n<p>The music that plays while you are gliding is \"Rollin' (Luxury Golf Cart Downtown Greens Version)\" by Dan Golding, originally performed for my game\u00a0<em>Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge</em>. It was the only music I had available but it fits really nicely.
