To get the job all you need to do is complete her challenge in 20 seconds. The challenge: move the parts that she requests out of the machine and into the adjacent box. How many times you must do\u00a0this will depend on the difficulty you choose.</p>\n<p>The idea for this game started with Clavis whose sexualized, muscular\u00a0design began as a joke for a friend but\u00a0now I've decided that I like ripped bunny girls. I also used this game to try an art style that feels more hand-drawn than what I usually do.</p>\r\nSound Credits:\r\n<p><strong>Sound Effects from Zapsplat: </strong>https://www.zapsplat.com/</p>\n<p><strong>Music by Eric Matyas: </strong>https://soundimage.org/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-18T15:36:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1d/f1dbab2cb1d814fd964023de75783f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Fava Beans"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
