When the ball drops out of the board instead of losing the ball you are dropped into another board where you continue the game. In each level you have to activate all the buttons and once all the boards are complete you win the game.</p>\n<p>Once you have beaten a level it will be shown in the level viewer so you can see how many of the levels you have beaten. We plan to improve this by adding a record of the number of times you have beaten each level as well as your fastest time to complete it.<br/></p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>The flippers are controlled with <br/>'a' or 'left arrow' for the left flipper<br/>'d' or 'right arrow' for the right flipper<br/>'space' to shake the ball if it gets stuck<br/>You can press 'esc' to pause the game, and from the pause menu you can return to the main menu or quit the game.<br/><br/><br/>Alpha 1.0:<br/>There are currently 21 boards and 3 different game modes.<br/></p>\n<p>For 5 board and 10 board there are a limited number of boards to complete.<br/>Sisyphean mode provides a true Sisyphean experience where every time you complete one of the boards in the loop it will be replaced with another in a never ending cycle. Be aware this mode ends only when you decide to stop playing.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Next build Alpha 1.5 will include mobile controls to allow for playing on a phone, minor graphics updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ff3/ff33961069ffd1b62d8706c85af05f0f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["SkillForge Games"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
