Enjoy the calm. Enjoy the view. Listen to the waves...<br/><br/>A Lonely Cabin is a short relaxing experience. Set in the middle of the ocean, a small cabin is just waiting for time to pass. You can control time to see this little cute scenery under different lightings.<br/><br/>This was made to support a 3D modeling course given by Jean-Baptiste Bledowski. He gave me the models and textures, and I integrated and animated everything. It is meant to give students an exemple of what could be made with the models they make during the course.<br/></p>\n<strong>CONTROLS</strong>\n<p><strong>Move your mouse</strong> to rotate the camera</p>\n<p>Press <strong>left / right arrows</strong> to control the time of the day</p>\n<p>Press <strong>Escape </strong>to open the pause menu</p>\n<strong>CREDITS</strong>\n<p><strong>Thomas Lebrun</strong> - VFX, Code &amp; Audio<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Jean-Baptiste Bledowski</strong> - 3D Models &amp; Textures</p>\n<strong>ADDITIONNAL CREDITS</strong>\n<p>Thanks to Daniel Zeller for its wonderfull water shader and code</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-25T04:28:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bb1/bb110111d0a2519b500dfa310f2aba1a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 112, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Raivk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
