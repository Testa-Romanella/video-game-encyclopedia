You receive orders, press buttons, flick switches and make decisions. It's a relatively short game, but it can take a few minutes to learn the basics. After that, the game progresses quickly. It's more like a 10-20 minute\u00a0<em>experience\u00a0</em>than a full game.\u00a0Anyway, I hope you enjoy it, and any feedback would be appreciated, as would any bug reports.<br/>Good luck!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Thumbnail - Redi0active <br/>Sound effects - Freesound.org</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T13:28:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/92067dd5debd72a09c8c197b228a944a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OverlyBurntToast"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
