That was the key to my design which I tried to keep following.<br/>Looking at my Trello, allow me to copypaste what I have written in \"Game Design\"<br/><strong>===============================================================</strong><br/>Paper Plane is trying to run out of space before it runs out of space(yeah, literally, get the joke?)<br/>Space is going to be like a tube but have a visual effect of an endless space.<br/>Pressing left/right slides you across a tube(plane is on the inner side), may be simulated with rotation I guess.<br/>There is an exit far away, on your way you should get speed up power ups.<br/>After you get to an exit, another plane spawns and runs after the last one.<br/>Problem is? First plane left a trail in its place, so every other following plane is literally running out of space while being in a space.<br/>Final score is decided by overall traveled distance and time you managed to stay alive.<br/><strong>===============================================================</strong><br/>I also remember my submission from LD41 where nobody managed to finished my game, so that was +1 drive to make an endless loop type of entertainment.</p>\n<p>Used:<br/>Unity 2018.2<br/>Zenject<br/>DOTween<br/>Shader Graph<br/>Trello<br/>Krita</p>\n<p><strong><em>What went right:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Self-management</strong><br/>-&gt; Using Trello I managed to pinpoint all the important points and milestones, what I need to cut down if things go nasty. It really took me 10 minutes to organize what I will refer every hour for the next two days.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong><br/>-&gt; Zenject took the pain of dependencies, every time I had to add something there was no \"damn how do I even...\" feeling<br/>-&gt; Shader Graph allowed me to make a few cool effects easily</p>\n<p><strong><em>What went wrong:</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scope</strong><br/>-&gt; There is just so much I wanted to implement in a given time frame, and yet here I am. Contentwise game is miserable: no music, no models, no testing performed. It's all programmed, except for starry sky texture made in Krita</p>\n<p><strong>Tools</strong><br/>-&gt; WebGL build is killing me, I remember having a bunch of problems with it last time<br/>This time it took me almost 4 hours to guess what was wrong</p>\n<p>Also some shader problems, halfway through I was able to switch texture on my skybox shader, but at some point in time it stopped working(noticed the bug too late)<br/>===============================================================<br/>All in all, I feel like this is a real improvement over what I managed to make for LD41.<br/>Can't wait to see what I will pull out for LD43!</p>\n<p>Project is open sourced at my github:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/metamorphling/LD42<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/207/2073e20376a1f6cc239d7a5eda23d2b0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["metamorphling"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
