Gravity is low, so you must learn to control your boost pack properly and evade the obstacles. Your air is limited, and each planet is full of dangers, but you have a job to do. You can always upgrade your equipment, and improve your odds of survival... for a price.\r\n</p><p>Languages: English, Espa\u00f1ol.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\r\n\tThe game currently supports XBox 360 controllers natively for gameplay, not for menus.
