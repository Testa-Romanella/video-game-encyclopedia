In these packages are blueprints which you must give to the supervisors of the communities. Then they can build the blueprints and the community grows in green energy. When you deliver the packages, you have to choose what to deliver based on the environment of the islands. There are elements to overcome to deliver the right package to the right person/community.</p>\n<p>This game was made by students from the HKU (University of the Arts Utrecht) and the UU\u00a0(Utrecht University) on behalf of Stockholm Resilience Center\u00a0to raise awareness about new technologies in the ocean.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<ul><li>Iris Wijnands - Research</li><li>Joris Derks - Programming</li><li>LauraKempff - UI &amp; Concept art</li><li>Nadja-May - 3D\u00a0models, particles &amp; concept art.</li><li>Danielle Visser- Particles &amp; Environment</li><li>Nowi Fate - Game Design &amp; Narrative</li></ul>\n<p>Special thanks to:</p>\n<ul><li>Wiebe Giebels - Mentor HKU</li><li>Joost Vervoort - Mentor UU</li><li>Charlotte Ballard - Stockholm Resilience Center</li><li>Andrew Merrie - Stockholm Resilience Center</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-26T06:28:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b27/b27d5deea6114e2be40d2367b5f82961.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 84, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["NowiFate", "Nadja May", "LauraKempff", "Moontowhee", "JorisDD"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
