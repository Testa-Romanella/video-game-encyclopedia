The game has an interesting story which I will tell at the bottom (major spoilers). It is recommended to play the game without any knowledge of the story or mechanics.</p>\n<p><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Story:</p>\n<p>It is a retro 3D platformer with a unique mechanic. Once you press W or S you will keep moving forwards or backwards respectively until you die or complete the level. Every time you press a key it counts as one \"operation\" that your old console has to register. Too many operations crashes the weak console. You therefore have to minimize the operations in each level. More story is given in the win page after you complete all 7 levels.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. There is an easter egg. Check the \"CheatCode\" script to find it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T14:23:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9cd/9cd5acf1ec7a061673af14b82030ea6c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arj783"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
