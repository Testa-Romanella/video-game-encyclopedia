It's about a cowboy prairie dog and horse wolf riding their way through four levels of critter-shooting action. The prairie dog and wolf each have a jump and shoot button, which you can combine to reach new heights and clear obstacles.</p>\n<p>The game can be played as a single-player game or two-player co-op, by either sharing a keyboard or using a keyboard and Xbox 360 controller (this version only supports one controller). I should also note that, if you're playing alone on the keyboard, comma and period do the same thing as A and S - I had time to add this alternate control scheme, but not to mention it in the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/abc/abcd302c2e05fc104dcbf484a9a202b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Kyatt/Impostor Cat Games"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
