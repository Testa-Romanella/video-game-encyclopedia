It was released on 11 September 2006. Part of the Lego Star Wars series, it is based on the Star Wars science fiction media franchise and Lego Group's Star Wars-themed toy line. It follows the events of the Star Wars films Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The game allows players to assume the roles of over 50 Lego versions of characters from the film series; customized characters can also be created. Camera movement was improved from its predecessor\u2014Lego Star Wars: The Video Game; and the concept of \"vehicle levels\" was explored more thoroughly. The game was revealed at American International Toy Fair 2006. Promotions for the game were set up at chain stores across the United States.</p>\n<p>Lego Star Wars II was critically and commercially successful; it has sold over 8.2 million copies worldwide as of May 2009. Critics praised the game for its comedic and \"adorable\" portrayal of the film series and for their preference of the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. However, the game's low difficulty, and its Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions in general, were received more poorly. The game received awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and Spike TV, among others. A mobile phone adaptation, Lego Star Wars II Mobile, was later developed by Universomo, published by THQ, and released on 19 December 2006. Lego Star Wars II and its predecessor were compiled in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, released in 2007.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2006-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-08T11:18:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d57/d5790e7e5a2b544792d99c54ab39faf0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.13, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 13, "owned": 75, "beaten": 198, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 22, "playing": 6}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 141, "suggestions_count": 386, "game_series_count": 10, "reviews_count": 143, "platforms": ["Xbox", "Game Boy Advance", "GameCube", "Xbox 360", "PlayStation 2", "Classic Macintosh", "PlayStation 3", "PSP", "PC"], "developers": ["Traveller's Tales", "Amaze Entertainment", "small", "(handheld)"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": ["Feral Interactive", "LucasArts Entertainment", "small", "(OS X)", "TT Games Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
