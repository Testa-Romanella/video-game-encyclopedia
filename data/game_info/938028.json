When you start the game, four different objects appear in the environment. These are additional features you can get in the tank game. These features are; health, shield, bouncing bullet, and high-damage bullet. When you take life objects in the tank game, the life of your tank increases. Taking the shielding object reduces the damage even if the firepower opened by the opposing team players is high. The bouncing bullet has a blue color. With this bullet, you can damage the enemy tank by bouncing the shot from the surrounding objects. Most of the time, it is recommended to use this bullet in tight spaces. You should think carefully before using it because bullets reach opponent tanks in a shorter time in tight spaces. The shot with significant damage has a red color in the tank game. Users who play tank games have always wanted to increase the damage power of bullets. Therefore, this item cannot be acquired as a tank upgrade but only by collecting it from the environment. When you get this item, your damage will be significant. Objects appear again after a while. Therefore, it may be a good strategy to win the game to hide in the places where the objects come out.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-10T04:52:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b751d428049d58bdbdb925ce3fa0f72e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Samet Acar", "Yusuf Islam Seyhan"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Inspector Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
