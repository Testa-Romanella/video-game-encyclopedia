This extra firepower, and more importantly the different mechanics in handling a shotgun compared to a revolver, offers a fresh take on the classic and deadly game of chance.</p>\n<p>The game takes place at the top of an underground nightclub, where the metal railings tremble to the pulse of long lost drum machines. A crooked AI dealer is waiting for you. Will you meet them?</p>\n<p>FEATURES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15 to 20 minute playthrough.  </li>\n<li>Immersive &amp; grounded tabletop gameplay, featuring diegetic systems and minimal UI.  </li>\n<li>Unscripted rounds that offer unpredictable yet controllable outcomes, with a fair amount of replay value.  </li>\n<li>A ruthless yet fair AI, that makes decisions based on what&#39;s on the table, rather than under it.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relatively modern dedicated graphics card (Vulkan support required)</li>\n</ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-23T02:28:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db7/db7ae9631980d614fac8d9ff51902df1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 4, "owned": 33, "beaten": 28, "toplay": 15, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 10, "ratings_count": 14, "suggestions_count": 205, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 15, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Mike Klubnika"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["CRITICAL REFLEX"], "esrb_rating": null}
