If all of your plants die, the game is over.</p>\n<p>The help them survive, collect the scraps on the level, and craft them into items at the workbench. Hints:<br/>- Water the plants to keep their water level high,<br/>- Kill snails with pesticide. Kill them as fast as you can, because they can reproduce.<br/>- Protect plants from lightnings with a lightning rod.<br/>- Shield the plants from stroms with an umbrella.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer:<br/>Unfortunately I had too many ideas for the game, and I couldn't finish the development proper. There is no sound, the art is ..well you can see it... and it is quite unbalanced. Sorry for that, I ran out of time. I hope you will enjoy it anyway.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T10:03:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/107/1071db1a793f36393125b588362c9e6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["One Bit Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
