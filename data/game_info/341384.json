The player who is able to convert all atoms into his/her color wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n<p>Here is how reaction works :<br/>Atoms placed at corners needs just one TAP to explode, Atoms placed on Sides will require 2 more TAPS to explode while the middle placed atoms will require 3 more TAPS to explode. It may sound confusing so there are screenshots to explain it better for you.<br/><br/>You will find that its an enjoyable game that is surprising for the first few times, interesting after some times and strategic once you have understood the logic.<br/><br/>That's all there is to tell you about this game,<br/>Hope you like it!<br/>Thanks a lot for your time!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-15T04:52:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24c/24cd023c39be376aeb74cd4ac2f8bb31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["DreamOclock"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
