The theme was 'One Room'.</p><p>All design, programing, audio, etc was done during the 48 hour period.  It's my first game jam and I learned a lot of things I didn't know how to do in Unity.  Hope to continue doing game jams to sharpen my speed and skills.</p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>Vote for my game here: http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&amp;uid=121983</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6c/c6c379ee5c76bcc58e353cdeefabd5e9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TacoTruckGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
