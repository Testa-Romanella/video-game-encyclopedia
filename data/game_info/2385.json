As their journey progresses and conflicting national interests come to the forefront, it becomes apparent that it will take more than a little work on both their parts if their relationship is to weather the boding storm on the horizon.<br/><br/>Having been at peace for only 15 years since the end of the Energi War, the kingdoms of Archleign and Ghalzabine are once again thrust onto center stage after a murder perpetrated by a clone, whose rights and freedoms they both lobbied for, comes to light.<br/>Hoping the treaty signed to end the use of clones for conventional warfare has not been violated, a joint-investigative team is put together to find out the cause and bring those responsible to justice.

Learning to harness these forces will allow the player to become more adept in skills related to them, which include attack, recovery, and support. Therefore, it would be wise to become acquainted with their use as early on in the game as possible.<br/><br/><br/>\u25bcSubmembers<br/>Characters outside the battle party can cooperate in various ways through the use of Assists. Depending on the combination of submembers, attack, defense and other parameters like the critical rate can be increased.
