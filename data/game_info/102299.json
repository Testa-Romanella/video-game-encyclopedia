As you proceed, collecting wisps and spirits, new Light Cores become available, allowing you to visit the Red, Green, Yellow and Blue worlds. You can alternate between them on the fly, by using your mouse buttons! <br/>Some unique objects are particular of a world. For example, steam machines will only work in the Red world, since it is the hottest one. Wood trampolines only exist in the Green world, etc... </p><ul><li>22 levels to explore, alternating between 4 worlds, each with different mechanics. </li><li>Lots of collectibles! Some easy to get, some downright impossible (unless you are skilled enough).</li><li>Intuitive controls: you move around, jump and change the world around you with the click of a button.</li><li>Auto-saving: your progress is saved automatically in a profile, so you can restart from where you were.</li><li>Main ending and alternative ending, unlocked at 100% completion.</li></ul><ul><li>Windows (x86/64) </li><li>Mac (on the works) </li><li>Linux (on the works)</li></ul><p>This demo includes the first 8 maps and 2 worlds (Red and Green).
