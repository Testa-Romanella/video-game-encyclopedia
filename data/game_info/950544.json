On the other hand on first few levels the swing cooldown is too long so you might get overwhelmed by the number of hands. Its all about balance</p>\n<p>GOOD LUCK!!!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This game was\u00a0made during XAMK game jam 31.03.2023 - 02.04.2023.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Made by XAMK university students of Game Design.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Special thanks to XAMK game jam organizers.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T15:10:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e0/6e0c0c2fae060215792062c3b94a2f28.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 141, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mihhail Selevko"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
