I think it's good, I don't think it's perfect - the testing and surveys I've done highlighted all its pain points and while most of them were sanded off, I'm aware of what it's still lacking. With the benefit of hindsight, I'd start it over from scratch using everything I learned during the mentorship - things that I learned as part of the process of creating it.<br/></p>\n<p>I'm planning to turn it into a full and fully refined game one day, but for now, that's the catch-22 we get. Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T18:38:26", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrMandolino"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
