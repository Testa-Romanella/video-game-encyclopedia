You are yourself, crafting imagery by exploring Plato\u2019s cave. Be part of the infinite process of creation. The deeper you descend into a far, dreamlike state, more cryptic entities emerge. What is a good state of consciousness? Why are we truly doing what we are doing?<br/><br/>Legend says the other side is made of blinding light. Fathom a way through the Elysian noise. You need to destroy a great many screens slowly filling the retina. Be the path, make a choice. On any true journey you grow a little. Ultimately, the game is about skilling visual composition, something one may use in the real world once in a while.<br/><br/>Intuition is key. You have to move playfully to create appealing and mesmerizing pictures and moods. At its core, wanting is suffering. Be free for a while, just behold, see all the passing by. Out of confusion, as the way is, and the wonder, out of the chaos would come bliss. Someone in wonder watching its art, is the aim and the end.Features<ul><li>EXPERIMENTAL \u2013 A surreal, ethereal near death experience.<br/></li><li>SIMPLE BUT HARD \u2013 You create the colors by changing your position, the angle and the hue.
