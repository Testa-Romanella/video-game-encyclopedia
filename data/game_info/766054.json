In menu there is a simple tutorial for keybindings. The enemies will spawn continuously, so you are bound to be overrun at some point. The question is how many kills you can mange to get before you die. To restore your health you can walk into healthpacks scattered around map. Health packs respawn after some time.</p>\n<p>Music by:\u00a0<strong><em>patrickdearteaga.com</em></strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T13:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96d/96d8361e0cf5abccf11d52889e0732f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AdamWenckaProd"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
