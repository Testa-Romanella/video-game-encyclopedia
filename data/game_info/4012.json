Resident Evil Revelations keeps the story and mechanics from the previous installments.  It\u2019s set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, taking place right after the creation of BSAA. Agents Jill Valentine and Parker are sent to the cruise ship Queen Zenobia in order to find two missing field agents Chris Redfield and Jessica. But they find a trap, set by a bioterrorist organization Veltro. And now players will have to solve puzzles and to kill monsters. <br />\nRevelations are using an episodic storytelling format, separating single player campaign into different segments, allowing players to experience different scenarios and play as several characters throughout the game. But it keeps the main focus and the events on the ghost ship. But aside from the single-player campaign, players can try to complete modified story mode scenarios, fitted for the combat survival. Completing the Raid Mode objectives will allow one or two players to receive experience points and weapons.</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2012-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-12T08:17:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/89a/89ac2742fcfeba3b95ac94457af766ef.jpg", "website": "http://www.facebook.com/residentevil", "rating": 3.77, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 297, "owned": 3062, "beaten": 553, "toplay": 117, "dropped": 117, "playing": 21}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 374, "ratings_count": 597, "suggestions_count": 632, "game_series_count": 19, "reviews_count": 599, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "Xbox 360", "Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "PlayStation 3", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 4", "PC"], "developers": ["Capcom", "Capcom U.S.A", "Tose"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["Capcom"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
