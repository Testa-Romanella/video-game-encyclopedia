Using science.<br/><br/><em>\"He certainly is a clam man.\" - Playtester</em><br/><br/>Thank You, Playtester - we couldn't agree more.</p>\n\n<p>But to be more specific: This is the story of a man, recently promoted to junior sales representative, enjoying the comforts and leisure of lower-mid-level office work. However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery.
