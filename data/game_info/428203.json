{"id": 428203, "slug": "malus-2", "name": "Malus", "name_original": "Malus", "description": "Malus is a Action Role Playing Game with an emphasis on horror, combat and gameplay. The game is much slower paced than your typical ARPG. <br/><br/>In Malus, the world has been overrun by eternal darkness. Demons have won the Celestial War and taken over the world. Every corner of the land you will find evil lurking. Humanity is in the brink of extinction. You play as either a Male or Female, you wake up in the middle of a forest, not knowing how you got there, you scower the land in search answers.<br/><br/>Soon uncovering dark and horrific secrets about the land and also yourself.<br/><br/><strong>Key Features:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Unique Combat System</strong><br/>Malus features a lock on mechanic, while in combat that allows you to maneuver around enemies effectively. You also have the ability to Block (if you have a shield equiped) and Dodge on command. Combat is slower and more tactical compared to other ARPGs<br/><br/><br/><strong>Realism</strong><br/>Your character keeps his weapon sheathed when not in combat, pulls an arrow out of the quiver when firing a bow and equips a lantern to light up dark areas. When there is no source of light, the area becomes almost pitch black. The goal is to create an immersive, believable atmospheric environment to allow players to engage in the story we wish to tell. We also try our best to minimize UI elements such as damage numbers and flashing enemies when hit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Loot and Item Diversities</strong><br/>Find rare and ancient weapons. Turn your character from a peasant to a menacing fighter. Defend yourself from the evergrowing horde of darkness<br/><br/><br/><strong> Attributes &amp; Skills</strong><br/>Upgrade your character using an old favorite of the ARPG formula. Learn new spells and skills and use your new found abilities to crush the demonic horde.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Horror Elements</strong><br/>Immerse yourself in a creepy and horrifying world. Dark and mysterious dungeons scatter the land for you to explore<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game will not include multiplayer (for now) It will instead be a single-player RPG game, The map will be Open World you can explore and do side quests and go wherever you want, there will be no invisible walls. You are only restricted by the strength of monsters in that particualr area.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-07T02:01:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adb91d449d454be482411f6494056ef0.jpg", "website": "http://www.projectmalus.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 13, "toplay": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 279, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rahman Abdul"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["team ramen"], "esrb_rating": null}
