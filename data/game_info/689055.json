Three unique level layouts planned out using online grid paper.</p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Three different\u00a0backgrounds of space and a new title page.</p>\n\n\n<p>3. Designed a new backdrop and adjusted the UI accordingly(white text, spacing).<br/></p>\n\n<p>4. Designed an icon for my game.</p>\n<p>I couldn't figure out why level 2 for the WebGL version wouldn't play without level 2's space background covering the tiles although I tried to build to WebGL and zip the file a few times only for it to change what level this occurred on. However I did test it on my Macbook and everything played alright despite it being the same build.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T05:54:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/620/62099458a8cf541d39b06a0a8ada94cb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rachel Tiv"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
