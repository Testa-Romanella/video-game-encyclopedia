I've tested both the HTML5 and Windows versions on a few different computers and there is always a bit of hitching (Especially on floor 0), I'm pretty sure this is something caused by Godot 4.0 stuff. The hitches pass and it's playable. <br/></strong></p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD - Move<br/>Arrow Keys - Attack<br/>Mouse - Click UI elements<br/></p>\n<p>Description - Fight your way to the top of the office building (Floor 4).</p>\n<p>The enemies act on every other turn, so be careful about your positioning and try to avoid taking to many hits. I've pumped up the HP on the player so it's more forgiving for the jam.</p>\n\n<p>Big thanks for Dishonest_Avocardo for the enemy texture :) :) :) <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T09:16:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7b9/7b90f093a784e3eb12673e32d18a57f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Mag"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
