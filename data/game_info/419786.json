{"id": 419786, "slug": "jumping-lights", "name": "Jumping Lights!", "name_original": "Jumping Lights!", "description": "You control a ball which must jump across the platforms \r\nuntil you reach the end. Pretty easy, right?\r\n    The best part comes now:\r\nYou will carry a flame that will indicate 2 colors \r\ndepending on whether you press the jump key or not. \r\n    Depending on the color you mark, you can fall on one surface \r\nor another. That is: if the flame is blue, you can only fall \r\non blue surfaces, and the same with the pink color.\r\n    You can change the color of the platforms at any time with \r\nthe mouse keys. \r\n    The \"ball\" can only jump when it is in a straight position. \r\nThat is: with the eyes up and the stomach down.\r\nThis means that if you are not in the correct position and press \r\nthe jump key ... Your character will not jump but it will change \r\nthe color of its flame and you will fall into the void if you do \r\nnot change the color of the platform quickly.\r\n    I forgot!\r\nYou must reach the target before the camera passes you or you \r\nwill be dead.\r\n    PD: It's my first game and I'd like to keep working on it.\r\nSo... I will be happy to receive advice :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-16T03:50:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/753/753398b9a0d7542edd2ceb513d7f5814.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AnthonyDerossi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
