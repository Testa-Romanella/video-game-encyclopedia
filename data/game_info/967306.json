He's a hopeless romantic and would do almost anything to help a friend in need.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Laura</h3>While her look definitely defines accurately her personality, Laura has been steadily softening as her relationship with Harry has become a more and more important part of her life. She's strict, but usually fair. Though if you're dead weight, she won't blink an eye before casting you aside. <br/><br/><br/><h3>Aya</h3>As the most useless employee in the office, Aya seems to almost make a point out of it daily. Luckily, she's working under Harry, which gives her a lot of leeway in terms of procrastinating. She's secretly in love with him, and won't hesitate to use her modest bosom to capture him like she would a dungeon in the video games she always plays during work hours!<br/><br/><br/><h3>Luca</h3>Luca is the representative of the subcontracting company that hired Harry's firm in order to develop a mobile app for them. He's very laidback and hardly finds anything interesting. Coincidentally, he's also Harry's childhood bully, although he's weirdly acting as though Harry is now his best buddy.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Sandra</h3>Sandra is Laura's mother. The two of them have been estranged ever since Sandra ran away with another man, leaving Laura behind with her single dad. But that's in the past. At least that's what Sandra is hoping. She's come back in Laura's life and has been actively trying for the past year to build a bridge between them. She's charming, kind-hearted, and still holds a touch of youthfulness.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T03:22:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11ad0fe742ffd5afa445ef690c66e306.jpg", "website": "https://hangovercatpurrroduction.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 455, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Hangover Cat Purrroduction"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Hangover Cat Purrroduction"], "esrb_rating": null}
