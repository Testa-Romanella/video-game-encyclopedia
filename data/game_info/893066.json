Stay upright for as long as possible to sink into your daydreams!</p>\n<p>This is version 1 of our game, made by SeijinWright\u00a0(twitter @seijinwright), HerpDerpityPurple (herpderpitypurple.itch.io), and CptRedder (reddersstuff.weebly.com). It was made as the final project in one of our game design classes at the University of Southern California, and we are all very happy with how it turned out!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-12T04:55:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/40d/40d3f1e3fe5a7f1e942f4afed32c14fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Seijin Wright"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
