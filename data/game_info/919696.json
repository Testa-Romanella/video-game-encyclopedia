Join<br/>science bot Rovee on 3 expeditions with the International Ocean<br/>Discovery Project. Drill core samples from below the ocean floor,<br/>compare the layers, investigate hypotheses, and piece together<br/>dramatic stories of life on Earth.<br/><br/>Stores from the Cores is a suite of 3 single-player mini games about<br/>deep ocean core science. The games feature multiple choice questions, <br/>exploring 3D environments with science bot Rovee via point and <br/>click controls. Collecting mineral samples for scientific research, and <br/>matching games that all teach players about deep ocean core science. <br/><br/>\u201cIt\u2019s like a fun game and you can learn from it.\u201d  Age 12<br/><br/>The mini games are the following:<br/><br/><strong>Mysteries of the Core </strong><br/>Why are bits of land plants found in cores drilled from<br/>under the sea floor far from shore?<br/><br/>\u201cIt's a colorful, interesting story, connected to what science is finding out.\u201d Age 40<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Deep Dark Life </strong><br/>How are microbes able to live inside rocks hundreds of feet below<br/>the sea floor? Find out what the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations<br/>has discovered.<br/><br/>\u201cI never thought of microbes at the bottom of the sea. I thought it was a<br/>dark place with nothing going on.\u201d Age 40s<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Die-no-saur</strong><br/>What do dinosaurs and plankton have in common? What happened<br/>on Earth when dinosaurs, plankton and lots of other life went extinct?<br/><br/>\u201cOcean drilling means\u2026getting samples from the ground to play back<br/>history to find out what happened.\u201d Age 14<br/><br/><br/><strong>Accuracy</strong><br/>These games are based on current scientific data. HOWEVER, we did add googley eyes to the microbes. <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Funding from</strong><br/>This project is funded through National Science Foundation Award #1515856 and the Center for<br/>Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T03:55:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e1d/e1d0e355a8fa715129da3c7b2165592e.jpg", "website": "https://joidesresolution.org/public/in-search-of-earths-secrets/drill-down-deeper/stories-from-the-core/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 332, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SleekTiki Interactive", "Ceisel & Associates"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["SleekTiki Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
