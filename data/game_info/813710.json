I'm Ethan Munday.\u00a0This is a game that I made solo. It's not my finest piece of work as I mainly entered this game jam to learn more about Unity 2D game making and to keep me involved with game development over the holidays. The entire premise of this game is incredibly silly and even if the game isn't the most polished, I hope you get a kick out of the epic battle of Eric Reece.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T06:41:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c7/6c708c7d0afe409ac8d3ed35f71b4cc8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EMunday"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
