Have fun ^-^ It should take less than 20 minutes to get through all of the endings. There are 8 in total, 6 in which you die.\u00a0There is one true ending.</p>\n<p>I created this just to figure out how to use Renpy so there isn't much of a story and the art is very simple. I wanted to add more, but I did not feel very good by the end and kept putting off working on it so I decided to just wrap it up.. I plan to add more cgs when I feel like drawing again. I hope you have fun!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>I\u00a0only had one beta tester outside of myself. I played the entire thing myself a quite a few times, but I\u00a0might've missed some things.
