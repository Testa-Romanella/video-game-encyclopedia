Teleport, jump, fly, bounce and drop in a hundred merciless and fast paced maps for the ultimate prize: Your soul!<br />\nMarty was having a late morning breakfast and minding his own business. The demon knocking on the door wasn\u2019t part of his morning routine. Before Marty was able to open, the hell breed smashed in the doors. A fierce brawl commenced and Marty lost his right arm \u2013 but at least the demon also lost his head. Unfortunately, whilst the brawl erupted more demons entered his garage and stole his last batch of limited edition Walrus Ale (tm). Now Marty has become furious! He ripped off the demon\u2019s arm and did some DIY to re-attach his arm back to himself. This demon is no looker but gee it casts some nasty fireballs. Marty\u2019s (after)life now has a single purpose: Go to hell and get his beer back!  \\m/<br />\nLike a bastard child of Quake 3 and Super Meat Boy, SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is truly hardcore and focuses on speed and fast reaction. Race and jump over platforms and bounce pads and shoot fireballs to reach an exit portal in the minimal amount of time. Reverse time and gravity. Compete with all players for the top time in the online high scores. Only the toughest players will receive the Uber Skull medals!<br />\nIf mind blowing speed and pumping adrenaline through your body is too boring, then search for the beer cans deeply hidden in each level. Who knows which secrets can be discovered by finding all of these delicious refreshments?FeaturesCan\u2019t get much more old school than this!<br />\n100 levels, each more devilish than the last, with secrets around every corner.<br />\nShoot fireballs, reverse gravity, teleport and dodge obstacles to solve challenges.<br />\nLeaderboards in each level so you can see how you fare against your friends (and enemies).<br />\nAn original soundtrack that&#39;ll make you rampage through the levels with blazing speed.<br />\nLevel editor<br />\n666<br />\nWarning: SEUM has been known to cause leaning disease. Symptoms are irrational leaning forward towards your screen when making difficult jumps. Smashing monitors with your head is not a way to beat the game!</p>", "metacritic": 77, "released": "2016-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-22T10:42:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76d/76d4a32df624f52f320644a61e264076.jpg", "website": "http://www.seumgame.com", "rating": 3.7, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 52, "owned": 700, "beaten": 22, "toplay": 7, "dropped": 21, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 57, "ratings_count": 55, "suggestions_count": 472, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 54, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "macOS", "Linux", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Headup Games", "Pine Studio"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Adventure", "Arcade", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Headup Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
