It was originally released on GameJolt, so I decided to upload it here as well.</p>\n<p>When Dracula leaves his castle for ONE hour, someone has let a bunch of villagers into it. When he returns, he must run through five areas in his castle and find out who let them in. Can you make it?</p>\n<p>Controls:<br/>Arrow Keys: Move<br/>Z: Jump<br/>X: Shoot Fireballs<br/>P: Pause Game<br/>ESC: Exit Game</p>\n<p>Note: This is my very first official game, so it's really short, and it only has 5 levels plus a final boss level. It's not that exciting, but it's a start!</p>\n<p>Note #2: Since the game's short, there's no saving, so if you restart or quit the game, you'll have to start all the way from the beginning.</p>\n<p>*WARNING*: If your computer detects the game as a virus, please do the following. Firstly before you download it, make sure to exclude your browser's downloads folder from being scanned by your anti-virus software as well as the location where the game will be stored.
