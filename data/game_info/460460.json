Along with Grand Prix and Battle mode, the game introduces two new modes; Alter-Ego and Team. Alter-Ego mode uses online functionality to allow players to race against ghosts records previously set by other players. Team mode allows two players to face against two computer-controlled opponents. The two players can combine their karts to form a more powerful kart, with one player driving and the other serving as the gunner, similar to Mario Kart Double Dash!!.</p>\n<p>The racing commentary returns in this game and this time, it is voiced in Japanese by Rica Matsumoto, who also voices Ash Ketchum in the Japanese version of the Pok\u00e9mon anime, and in English by Jack Merluzzi, who played in the in-game announcer in Fast Racing Neo.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2013-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-14T18:53:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/447/4472d061b492732a327fc23d2d600a39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 211, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["Bandai Namco Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
