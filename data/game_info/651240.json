Those times were dark and terrifying and so is the game.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start in a civil defense shelter deep under a Prague Metro station. As a proud holder of the military readiness badge you know what your duty is: put on a non-functioning gas mask, load the vz. 52 pistol and protect the peace and your socialist homeland from the strange intruders*.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<ul><li> The classic gameplay and vibe of romeric shooters from 1990s including a fitting brown retro aesthetic.\n<br/>\n</li><li> You'll find a shotgun, a vz. 13 SMG, a rocket launcher and even some secret experimental Soviet battery-powered weapons (e.g. a ball lightning launcher). If you run out of ammo, you might find the hammer and sickle coming in handy.\n<br/>\n</li><li> Handcrafted levels inspired by real locations with an emphasis on historical details.
