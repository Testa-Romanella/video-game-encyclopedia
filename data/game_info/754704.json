I love NieR series so it pushed me to do more by adding music, inventory, map and life system. It's a short game with some endings, but it was fun to do with few elements.</p>\n<p>Write and test by:<br/>Maxence Rerat\u00a0-\u00a0https://kero-san.itch.io/<br/>Alexis Martelli\u00a0-\u00a0https://minosu2a.itch.io/<br/><br/>If you find a strange code, some browsers corrupt it.<br/>Here is the correct code :<br/>--. --- .-.. .. .- - ....\u00a0 \u00a0.- .-- .- -.- . -.\u00a0 \u00a0... --- --- -.<br/><br/>(Decode it only if you find it, it's not that hard :D)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-14T17:04:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/66c/66c65714ea4b87bb3370407ca2fc39cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kero-san"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
