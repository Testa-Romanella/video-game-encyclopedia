One minute, you were asleep in your bed, the next... you find yourself in an alien spacecraft!  ACK, you've been abducted!  Your alien captors are about to subject you to an Interstellar IQ test (IIQ).  If you pass the IIQ, you get to go home.  If you don't, well... I guess you're just going to have to find out!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe test is timed.  Press start and place the variously shaped \"objects\" into their similarly shaped \"slots\" on the alien console.
