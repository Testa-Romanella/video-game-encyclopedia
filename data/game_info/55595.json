It is the first game in the Quest for Glory series, and has been credited for being a genre-defining game, as it tried to mix graphical adventure gaming with role-playing-like elements such as statistic building (strength, intelligence, health) that would actually affect the ability to accomplish certain parts of the game. The game has a satirical and silly tone. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST, and NEC PC-9801 were released in the early 1990s. A VGA remake, titled Quest for Glory I: So You Want To Be A Hero, was released in 1992 for the DOS and later in 1994 for the Mac OS.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/09451ddffa5bc0d34f155ff28219c96e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.43, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 7, "owned": 7, "beaten": 5, "toplay": 5, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 7, "suggestions_count": 187, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 7, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Sierra Entertainment", "Sierra On-Line"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": ["Sierra On-Line", "Sierra Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
