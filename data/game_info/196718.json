I originally started building this game because there's not a load of great games that arent blocked at my school. Later one of my friends who won a Github Bug Bounty told me about Github Game Off. I found out the theme was throwback. I was able to put everything that I felt had been \"forgotten\" into one project. This game takes inspiration from other games like Peggle, Plinko and Bubble Shooter. It uses an 80s futuristic design with appealing glowing effects. This game also includes 80s retro and synthwave music from one of my favourite artist. Even though now, that artist has unexpectedly disappeared from the internet. If the glow effects are causing lag, then turn it off by pressing G.</p>\n<strong>Controls</strong>\n<p>A or Left Arrow - Slide left</p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow - Slide right</p>\n<p>A or Left Arrow - Rotate left</p>\n<p>D or Right Arrow - Rotate right</p>\n<p>W - Sliding Brakes</p>\n<p>S - Sliding Brakes</p>\n<p>Space or K - Shoot balls</p>\n<p>You will know that you're ready to fire if the muzzle of the player's cannon is charged up.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>X or K - Shoot your charged ability (Powershot)</p>\n<p>You will know your Powershot charge by looking at how much the circle of the player's cannon is charged up.
