You play a male character who at a youngish age was kicked out of home and since then has been barely getting through life. That is until one day when approached by a stranger to look after some merchandise for him, your world is switched upside down. All thanks to a magical pill.</p>\n<p>You will encounter many different people along the way as you improve your life and hopefully get back in contact and in a relationship with the ones you left behind, as well as some others along the way. How closer relationship your build with each person you encounter will be purely down to your choice and preference.\u200b</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-13T19:42:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e04/e04f56e65b3f587eb682a60904ec4546.jpg", "website": "https://www.patreon.com/cr8tivem3dia", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 208, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": [], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
