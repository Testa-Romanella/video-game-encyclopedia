The goal is to get as high of a score as possible. Keep in mind that you can toggle blocks on/off with the 5 key (space) You should be able to play through the entire game in less than 10 minutes. The mama alien will be happier at the end of the game if you rescue as many baby alien eggs as possible!</p>\n<p>The game is designed around the extreme limitations of the Nokia 3310. I tried to envision something that might have been able to run on this great old phone. Since I decided to use a vertical format, I picture that the phone would be held sideways to play it.<br/></p>\n<p>This is for the NOKIA 3310 JAM 3\r\n which is my fourth game jam and the second one that I'm entering with a 1-bit constraint. For some reason the extreme limitations have been appealing to me. I hope you like ALIEN EGGS!</p>\n<p>-Ben<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-08T04:21:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2dc/2dc0c2b4a53426728cef165c61707e63.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BenJelter"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
