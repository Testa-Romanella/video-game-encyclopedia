Modest suburban homes and storefronts nestle together in rows around the periphery, but the streets are empty, the air coated with a thin haze of fog. There is not a sound of life, not even from the things which may be birds flapping above. All that you can hear are the dark waves which lap lazily at a pier to your east, the fluorescent ring of something electric in the air, and a single word, echoes of a whisper fading in your inner ear, like the last line of a conversation cut short in mid-dream:<br/></p>\n<p>\"Anagogia.\"</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>ANAGOGIA is a short interactive fiction game set in a mysterious, inhospitable world of liminal spaces. For good or ill, you cannot die or fail, only persevere and bear witness. Journey in the cardinal directions, acquire the Four Concessions, and discover the secrets of Anagogia - and how to escape.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:40:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/77c/77cad4a69d1baa3914c43e6eb601fe29.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 143, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Trevor Neil White"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
