Your contraptions can only operate within range of the towers. Gather materials to build more towers to expand your territory.</p>\n<p>Only your opponents use the same power towers, so where you can go they can go.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I didn't have time to make a tutorial, and this game is buggy and hard to understand as it is, but I will do my best to explain it here:</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to destroy your opponents power generator, and keep them from destroying yours.</p>\n<p>Their are 3 unit types</p>\n<ul><li>Exploiters: they can harvest materials from mountains or other units.</li><li>Builders: they turn materials into more units or power towers.</li><li>Solders: go fast and shoot things.</li></ul>\n<p>You select units by left-clicking on them and then you will see a yellow aura around the selected unit. Right-click on a valid target within the aura to use that units ability as explained above.</p>\n<p>You can move/rotate the camera by dragging the mouse across the screen while holding left/right buttons\u00a0 respectively. Scroll to zoom.</p>\n<p>Never Join a game jam at the last moment kids!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T10:11:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbf/fbf9e1ea1c21cd2b93c4b14e220067c0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["WalrusWilram"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
