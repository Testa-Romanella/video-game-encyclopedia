There are three game modes built in but the game is not the conventional eat-to-expand game that first appeared in the eighties. This time you\u2019re chewing up chargers on a power network in outer-space to prevent the shut down of the planets entire electrical network which will put the Earth back into the stone-age.<br/></p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tricky game to master but extremely easy to pick up and play a casual game to unwind - especially with the three different game modes that extend the play. Normal, Zen and Nasty play out pretty much how they sound.</p>\n<p>Normal: Consume the dischargers to stay alive. Your power is constantly being drained by the grid and this is the only way to keep up. Every movement will drop a deflector, which is your means to change direction, so you need to be quick with your fingers to preserve movement options.</p>\n<p>Zen: Play is similar to \"Normal\" mode but deflectors that are destroyed around the explosion will also get you points.</p>\n<p>Nasty: Iis exactly that. Consuming dischargers won\u2019t clear the deflectors on the X and Y paths around you so it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that you\u2019re on borrowed time. Here\u2019s where you have the real challenge of trying to get a decent score.</p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t it lucky that iDef will store all your gameplay records in a handy statistics screen so you can have bragging rights over your mates who aren\u2019t as good at it?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/582/582839939a17c2f4beab5e882c2448cd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["conceptAlpha"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
