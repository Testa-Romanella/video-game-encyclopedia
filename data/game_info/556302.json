This demo shows a simple CC level with two test-sounds. You need to click the canvas once it runs.<br/></p>\n<p>This is basically just a test for various things: the sound engine, the fps mouse control and how/whether Coppercube works on itch.io.</p>\n<p>NOTE: pity, the keyboard handler doesn't work, so you can't walk around. It works outside of itch.io.</p>\n<p>Download this ZIP from my mini3Dsoundengine project page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-12T05:10:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f94/f94dc644c5e4782d2d9659d97e88915f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["jfkEO1010etc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
