{"id": 508699, "slug": "odd-or-even", "name": "Odd or Even", "name_original": "Odd or Even", "description": "<p>A game of simple speed math and reflexes, played between 2 teams on a single touchscreen.</p>\n<p>Best played fullscreen on a tablet, smartphone, or touchscreen PC.</p>\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>There are 2 teams, <strong>Odd</strong> and <strong>Even</strong>. Each math expression's result has a <em>parity</em> of either <strong>odd</strong> or <strong>even</strong>.</p>\n<p>There\u00a0are\u00a02\u00a0buttons\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0center,\u00a0\u25ef\u00a0and\u00a0\u2715.\u00a0If the result matches your team, press \u25ef. If it doesn't match your team, press \u2715. Race against your opponent to press the correct button for your team.</p>\r\nMath Tips\r\n<p>It is not necessary to actually evaluate the expression to find out its parity. These are the rules of parity:</p>\r\nAddition and subtraction\r\n<ul><li>even \u00b1 even = even</li><li>even \u00b1 odd = odd</li><li>odd \u00b1 odd = even</li></ul>\r\nMultiplication\r\n<ul><li>even \u00d7 even = even</li><li>even \u00d7 odd = even</li><li>odd \u00d7 odd = odd</li></ul>\n<p>Easy and normal difficulties only include addition and subtraction, so determining parity in those difficulties is only a matter of counting the number of odd numbers. <strong>If there are an odd number of odd numbers, the result is odd.</strong></p>\n<p>Hard difficulty adds multiplication to the mix, forcing players to pay attention to the order of operations.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-23T03:00:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e0/4e01c8f39561b8361c8d0d2a956efb25.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Joshua Fan"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
