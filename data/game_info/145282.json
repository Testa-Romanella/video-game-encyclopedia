{"id": 145282, "slug": "acquisition-stephengurnett", "name": "Acquisition (stephen.gurnett)", "name_original": "Acquisition (stephen.gurnett)", "description": "<p>Acquisition is a two player board game. Each turn you choose a space to move to and roll the dice to win counters to place around it. As long as you have at least one counter against a space, it will be possible to move to it as long as it's adjacent to you. If you have all the counters around a space, it counts as a free move. The goal is to capture your opponent's flags before they can capture yours. Be aware that the flag is heavy and carrying it will restrict your movement to a single turn. Whilst this makes you more vulnerable, you can only be attacked by an opponent who is carrying a flag.</p><p>Acquisition is in playable form but changes will be made based on play-testing.</p><p> Includes graphics by @ChocolateJesus </p><p>Music:<br/></p><p>\"Phantasm\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fb6/fb6a2465ed0caa0e3c808b406f8018f6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["stephen.gurnett"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
