DO NOT expect this to ever be 100% complete. Although I hope I can actually make this game a reality, I am mainly developing it to practice my skills in programing, so my goal is to make a good game, with good and working mechanics, not a full-fledged experience.</p>\n<p>In order to play the game you must first forward a UDP port of your choosing, if you want to host a server. This is different with every router, so I won't be able to explain how to do it. After forwarding the port, you can start the game and click on host and set the port to the one you forwarder earlier. To connect to a server you must simply chose the right IP address and port and click accept. When all the players are ready the game will start automatically.</p>\n<p>Known issues(I am already working on fixing them):</p>\n<p>-Player names appear in mid air when another player is directly behind you.</p>\n<p>-Sometimes, when you press Ready or Start in the lobby the game will crash.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter any errors, apart from the known ones, please post a comment detailing them</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- WASD: move</p>\n<p>-Mouse: look</p>\n<p>-(in-game only)Escape: close host and all clients</p>\n<p>-CTRL + F: Toggle fullscreen</p>\n<p>I don't yet have a way you can support me, but I will eventually accept donations on my main project.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-18T04:36:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f47/f47236a7f38e973f9c8a0af43343b13d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["szabo_tudor"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
