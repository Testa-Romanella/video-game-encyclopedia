The action takes place in the 60s, and you're tasked with commanding a crew of three soldiers driving a car, over a span of 20 level campaign. Your ultimate objective is to send the car flying to the moon, by driving it very fast into a ramp, which may, or may not succeed.</p>\n<p>The gameplay itself is fairly simple: you drive a car in a straight line, avoiding the obstacles, and picking up objects like fuel tanks and whatnot. With that said you need to reach the finish line or a ramp, with a specific amount of speed gained.</p>\n<p>Aside from 20 level campaign, the game also has two additional game modes: endless and longplay.</p>\n\r\nWhy is Soviet Space?\r\n<p>Originally it was meant to be created for a game jam in less then a month, however, due to many factors the deadline was not met and therefore it failed. I've decided to finish it anyways after the deadline, but due to the same factors, and also due to me wanting to add even more content then there should have been, it took way more time then it was meant to take.</p>\n<p>In the end, it didn't turn out as I wanted it to, and it felt more like an experiment. But at least it got finished, and you can (probably) play it without any bigger problems!</p>\r\nWhat is Soviet Space Plus?\r\n<p>That is a special version of Soviet Space for those mad lads who have donated at least one dollar. Both versions are pretty much the same, albeit the plus version: has 14 exclusive decorations, gives you 50% more rubles, gives you instant access to bonus game modes (without needing to finish specific campaign levels), and also gives you access to a few dev commands.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-02T04:48:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/415/4154e88f048ae15ae3346bb25512ed3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GMPguy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
