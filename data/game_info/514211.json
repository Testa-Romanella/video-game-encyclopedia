Explore an infinite map and discover strange anomalies along the way. Interact with a variety of different entities and odd occurrences that are procedural and earn some quick cash. Use money to buy some procedural loot from shops and take down enemies. Game feeling too easy? Make the world more unstable by fighting rare and difficult bosses, causing more anomalies to appear and enemies to be stronger and spawn more. Collect large amounts of loot and use your compass to track your position. Share places of interest with other players by sharing the coords, and visit specific coordinates with portals! There are plenty of different anomalies to discover in The Dark and tons of loot to be collected. Enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-02T06:33:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c2/1c209d3b9f3b598b196cb02214c29aea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LemonDude"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
