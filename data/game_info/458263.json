(I thought it helps if I show what the range is for each tower in the title screen.)</p>\n<p>- Towers may reload while an enemy is still in their range, and not while there are no enemies in their sight.</p>\n<p>Anyways, enjoy what I created.\u00a0 That is all.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-26T04:06:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/46d/46d8906ae8f41d85852410cd32ac42da.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["OrbitalVStriker"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
