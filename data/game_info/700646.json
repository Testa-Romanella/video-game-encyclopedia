You can\u2019t believe your friends convinced you to come here after some stupid bet. The wind bites at your skin and whispers in your ear, were you not alone, it would just be uncomfortable, but you find yourself watching moving leaves in the trees and listening to every sound\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Honk</em>\n</p>\n<p>A sound that should be normal in a rural area suddenly sends a chill down your spine. You remember them telling you a creepy story before sending you up here. Something about some rich family that fell out of favour due to bad rumours. You can\u2019t remember all the details right now, as your eyes skitter left and right, trying to watch shadows as tree branches move in the wind.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Honk</em>\n</p>\n<p>A little weird, but you suddenly remember the family\u2019s story had to do with children, someone during the conversation talked about it but you didn\u2019t feel like hearing about how a bunch of kids got maimed and tortured, even some of the tougher people were making grimaces and shook their head as you glanced at them while talking to someone else.\r\n </p>\n<p>You absent-mindedly step on a branch.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Honk</em>\n</p>\n<p>Was that behind you?

The weird stories about this place are nonsense, you press on, suppressing any fear you may have.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>HONK</em>\n</p>\n<p>You turn around to look at the noise.\r\n </p>\n<p>Nothing.\r\n </p>\n<p>You look back, and there is a clearing in front of you, as if the forest suddenly disappeared before you. An abandoned manor can be seen in the distance, with what looks to be an abandoned playground closer to you. You feel pulled towards the desolate playground, the swings eerily moving and the merry go round almost creaking from the wind, why were you here again? You move towards some shadowy figures all in a circle, and suddenly, without knowing why, you find yourself leaning over and whispering:\r\n\u201cDuck\u2026\u201d\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Our team of goose wranglers:</p>\n<p>Herman Wu -- Animator</p>\n<p>Victoria Lima -- Programmer</p>\n<p>Andi Guyette -- 3d Artist/Character Modeler</p>\n<p>Timothy E. -- Programmer</p>\n<p>Ashfeather Wilson -- Wrangler in chief, Bad Pun Ideas, Sound, Level design, Textures</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-26T11:09:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e18/e18e7e01623820deb3ec015cb3073f95.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 68, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Silverbird", "Herman Wu", "Haineko", "GenghisBlonde"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
