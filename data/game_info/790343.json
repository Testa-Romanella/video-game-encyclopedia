May is mental health awareness month and DeepWell's goal is to create fun and valuable games that support mental health struggles and celebrate the mental health community. With this focus we wanted to make a game that took some of the more common symptoms associated with anxiety and depression and use therapist supported tools (some linked below) and strategies to help combat them (literally).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sara of Tonin is an adventure game where you play as Sara, trying to explore a castle to find the cure for the problems you have been having (anxiety and depression). As you explore, you find tools to help you battle overthinking, intrusive thoughts, hopelessness and more! You use your energy (spoons) to battle and gain health from lessons in grounding practices. These help you on your journey through out the castle.\u00a0</p>\r\nTeam\r\n<ul><li><strong>Programming</strong>: Clang and Zach</li><li><strong>Art</strong>: ArcTan</li><li><strong>Design</strong>: Jessi</li></ul>\r\nAssets Borrowed\r\n<ul><li>Music<ul><li>\u00a0\"<em>Thoughts</em>\" Jonathan Shaw (www.jshaw.co.uk)</li></ul><ul><li>\"<em>Army of Darkness</em>\"\u00a0 Karate Studios</li></ul><ul><li>\u00a0\"<em>Chaos Castle</em> \" FoxSynergy</li></ul></li><li>Tilesets<ul><li>\"<em>Dungeon Tileset</em>\" Calciumtrice and Georg Eckert</li><li>\"<em>Bookcase and Library Tileset</em>\"\u00a0Candacis and PandaMaru</li></ul></li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T09:37:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/12b/12bc4fe93876897654d408353654ff13.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Knitwit Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
