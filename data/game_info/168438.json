What if people had different distance between the eyes or different field of view? Will we still recognize\u00a0stereoscopy? What will happen if we can pull our eyes out of the head and turn them to look at ourselves?<br/></p>\n<p>Play this experience and you will figure it out, what is it like to have alternative eyes.</p>\n<p>---------------</p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<p>Use\u00a0VR controllers.</p>\n<ul><li>Slide with your thumb on the left touchpad to alternate eyes field of view.\u00a0</li><li>Slide with your thumb on the right touchpad to alternate distance between the eyes.</li><li>Grab your eyes with a hand by bringing your hand close to your head and pressing the trigger.
