Cat Zombies! Now they are terrorizing the city and it\u2019s up to our hero - Doodle, a brave little ball of yarn - to save the day.<br/></em></p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>In Yarn you control the character by using just the <strong>X</strong> button. Avoid the traps, collect the stars and stomp on the zombie cats to complete each level. This version of the game is a demake of an iOS game created by a couple friends of mine.</p>\n<p>Check out the complete Yarn game for iOS at https://is.gd/yarngame</p>\r\nSettings\r\n<p><strong>Transparency</strong> - In the pause menu you can turn on an experimental transparency feature. Transparency is achieved by flickering some sprites on and off between frames. This works well in some environments and not so well in others. It is disabled by default.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T07:03:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ca6/ca6aca9eaffe5d47a9ac57bf7a656f9b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kevin Thompson"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
