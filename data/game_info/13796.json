If it all gets a bit too much you can use your Time Buffer to slow down the action and turn defeat into victory. Players can compete across seven different game modes with online high-score tables and Achievements in their pursuit of twin-stick perfection.", "metacritic": 82, "released": "2011-11-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-18T00:47:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d38/d3857bf3217f7b30b5e71d4c1963793b.jpg", "website": "http://waves.squidinabox.com", "rating": 3.5, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 24, "owned": 813, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 9}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 54, "ratings_count": 28, "suggestions_count": 362, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 28, "platforms": ["Android", "PC"], "developers": ["Voodoo", "Squid In A Box"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squid In A Box"], "esrb_rating": null}
