There is a horde of sea monsters headed towards a nearby defenseless port town. You must utilize your powers to fly around and skewer all monsters before they reach the port's docks.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Mouse Cursor - Sabre will always move towards your mouse cursor.</p>\n<p>Left Click - Sabre lunges towards the point you clicked skewering the first enemy in the way.</p><p>Escape - Toggle Pause Menu<br/></p>\r\nMechanics\r\n<p>Sabre's lunge has a one second cooldown when used. If your lunge hits an enemy, it instantly resets the cooldown. So you can keep comboing lunges as long as you score hits!<br/></p>\r\nEnemies\r\n<p><strong>Fish-like Monster -</strong> These monsters are dumb and slow.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Dolphin-like Monster -</strong> These monsters are fast and periodically dive underneath the surface of the water preventing them from being skewered.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Artillery Whale -</strong> These monsters are too large to skewer. They surface only enough to allow a large gun upon their back to begin firing at the docks. You can skewer their shots out of the air though.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-17T20:34:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c04/c0409f9e2831b15e6843276911bbe43b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rufflesworth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
