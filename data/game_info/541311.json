It all started as a loose collection of what we as a team liked: simple yet hard platforming, lasers, electronic music, puzzles with many layers, and the Quake 3's map editor (ya, that's a weird one...). From there, it went from student project to startup project to a way to stay connected. <br/><br/>So, thanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy our odd, little game <strong>&lt;3</strong>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-11T02:28:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d0f/d0fb39e872a9e61d5a4c253237263e3c.jpg", "website": "http://www.teknedia.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Stache Studios"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Stache Studios"], "esrb_rating": null}
