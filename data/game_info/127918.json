Really there's only one thing that never changes. The darkness. I cannot run. I cannot escape. There is only one way to go: forwards. Into the unknown. Towards the very thing that hunts me.</p><p>The Enemy Silence is a horror game that tests just one of your senses to the very limit: your hearing. Walk through eerie soundscapes and terrifying places to reach sanctuary. But to reach sanctuary you'll have to avoid the horrors that await you.</p><p>The thing that lurks in the shadows is listening out for your footsteps. As it wanders it is waiting for you to panic, for you to slip up and take just one step that's far too loud.</p><p><strong>Controls</strong></p><p>Left-click takes a step. The faster you take steps, the more noise you will make.</p><p>There's something looking for you in the darkness. Listen out for it and don't let it hear you.<br/></p><p>Space restarts the level after failure.</p><p><strong>The Kickstarter can be found here.</strong><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9bb/9bbeb7a4c0485a628b99c1a7d7e926fa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CometGoat"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
