Right now it kind of looks like bargain-bin Portal. Gameplay-wise, though, it's not really a puzzle game, just a platformer right now. I plan to add in enemies you can shoot, as well as hazards. In the end, I'm hoping to have a more fast-paced, action-heavy first-person shooter/platformer with teleporting being used not just to navigate the levels, but also to flank enemies and stuff. Maybe nothing will come of it, though.
