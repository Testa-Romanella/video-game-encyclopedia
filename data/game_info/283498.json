{"id": 283498, "slug": "worm-adventure-2", "name": "Worm Adventure 2", "name_original": "Worm Adventure 2", "description": "<p>After regaining his human form again in worm adventure 1, our hero eats a bowl of oatmeal and goes to bed; however, unbeknownst to him, the oatmeal was poisoned. Sadly, upon waking up, he has been changed back into a worm (how convenient)! It's up to you to change him back to a human--again. Use the arrow-keys to crawl, squirm, wiggle and leap your way to the end of the game, and\u00a0most importantly, don't get frustrated. The whole game can be beaten in under 5 minutes if you know what you are doing, but it should take a new player between 30 minutes to hour.</p>\n<p>DOWNLOAD INFO</p>\n<p>1.
