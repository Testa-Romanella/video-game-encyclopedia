Then the ship is WAY more agile and the game becomes fast-paced.</p>\n<p>This decision was by design to put you in the situation that you are always in need of green debris to keep going. You can play the save game with a sitting duck ship, but then don't blame me, if you can't dodge a fast red debris coming your way :-)</p>\n\n\n<p>In the year 2078, NASA started to launch <strong>Collector Ships</strong>\u00a0to get rid of the overwhelming amount of <strong>debris in Earth's orbit</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those ships should gather all the floating pieces we left up there.</p>\n<p><strong>Their strength:</strong> They collect everything.<br/><strong>Their weakness:</strong> They collect everything.</p>\n<p>Try to gather as many recycleable debris as possible to have your fuel refilled through your on-board-refinery, so you can continue gathering.</p>\n<p>When you are out of fuel, Autopilot takes over and returns you to earth.</p>\n<p>You get paid based on the amount of debris collected.</p>\n<p>Take care! Collecting something too big for your storage might crash your ship!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-12T15:59:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65a/65a13d2c088dde9624b77187181c3420.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grisgram"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
