Our \n      best hope for a tidier cosmos is to send the Flametail\u2122 incinerator pod \n      from planet to planet for a little fiery cleanup. Take control of the \n      Flametail pod and start winding your way through obstacles, then watch \n      as your flaming tail ignites blocks of troublesome debris and eventually \n      eliminates them. Be careful not to work yourself into a dead end, and \n      don't let the hazard line that follows you catch up to your tail or \n      reach any leftover garbage. Luckily, you can find useful items (such as \n      bombs or score multipliers) along your path and earn special power-ups \n      (like radar or a missile) by collecting letter panels to spell \n      particular words. Effectively burn up the floating garbage in the game's \n      two modes - Space Tour and Time Limit - and earn new graphics and other \n      surprises as you progress. The straightforward controls make it possible \n      for anyone to take on the job of restoring space to pristine condition. \n      Do you have what it takes to make your way to the outer reaches of the \n      solar system?\n    </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2010-06-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce4/ce4806f7e6001e016074c37393f0a855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Nintendo DS"], "developers": [], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
