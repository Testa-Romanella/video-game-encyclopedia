Will you survive?<p>Jason's Coming is a single-room text-adventure made in a day to get back into Inform 7.<br/></p><p>I will be taking questions now.</p><p>Q: How do I play?<br/>A: Click the \"Play in Browser\" link in the game view and starting typing in commands. if you need more guidance than that. The Home view has a link titled \"Introduction to IF\". Might be a helpful primer if you're lost.</p><p>Q: The \"Play In Browser\" thing breaks on my phone.<br/>A: Yeah sorry about that. No idea why. Will try fixing sometime soon.<br/></p><p>Q: Is this really a serious game? I've been looking for one. I dunno. The cover image looks kinda goofy.<br/>A: Only one way to find out.</p><p>Q: Is this a work in progress?<br/>A: Yes, but only insofar as I am still hunting bugs and oddities. I consider it feature complete<br/></p><p>Q: Really?<br/>A: That's not a question.</p><p>Q: What can you even do in it? It seems kinda small.<br/>A: Well it's just a silly game I slapped together in a day. It has like... 5 endings that aren't you dying or something. Go hunt for those!</p><p>Q: Does it have a gun in it?<br/>A: It does. I know. Hack move. Everybody's first proper finished text adventure has a gun in it. But see here, this isn't my first text adventure at all. Hah!</p><p>Q: Did that one have a gun in it?<br/>A: I'm done answering questions.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T11:33:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e9/6e9643b92ef9661fcf2b4a93ed32c514.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nichtschwert"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
