{"id": 441655, "slug": "oasis-defense", "name": "Oasis Defense", "name_original": "Oasis Defense", "description": "If you want each level of tower defense game to be full of surprises and changes instead of just brain burning calculation, Oasis Defense is the game you are looking for. Here, every game is a journey to choose the path of evolution.<br/><br/>Oasis Defense is a minimalist tower defense game. It is very easy to start. You will plant trees to fight against the ghost army, and choose your own evolutionary path among the random gained rewards to protect your oasis.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The arrangement of trees has a high degree of freedom. You can fully use your artistic talent, but at the same time, you should pay attention to that all trees will be attacked by the enemy, so the defensive formation is very important. You should carefully protect the fragile resource trees and let the high damage trees have good positions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>After defeating each wave of enemies, you will get random evolution options and make choices from them. Therefore, this is not a game that can be calculated accurately in advance. Players need to adjust their evolution routes and array strategies according to the situation.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re thinking about buying Oasis Defense please keep in mind that this is a game developed independently by a game lover. I just hope this game can bring a tower defense experience with more surprises and changes to the players.<br/><br/>Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have feedback, questions, or problems with the game.
