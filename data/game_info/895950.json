You must clear each map in this classic terrorist-hunt style third-person shooter game. Features unique aim recoil mechanics. Players are penalized for \"tactical reloads\" losing any partial magazines or clips if reload before empty. Ammo conservation is important in the early stages. As you progress through each level, you keep you accumulated guns and ammo. The game rewards you at the completion of each stage by applying bonuses for stealth, speed, and accuracy. Progress is saved after the completion of each level so you can continue a previous game. At the end of the game, there is a retro \"high scores\" entry with your initials. Currently all high scores are local only and there is no online leaderboard. Features three unique weapons - a pistol, single shot rifle, and a fully automatic assault rifle.</p>\r\nControls\r\nMouse and Keyboard\r\n<p>Movement: WASD<br/>Look/Aim: Mouse<br/>Jump: Space Bar<br/>Shoot: Left Mouse Button<br/>Crouch: Left Shift (Hold)<br/>Reload: Right Mouse Button<br/>Next Weapon: Mouse Wheel Up<br/>Previous Weapon: Mouse Wheel Down</p>\r\nGamepad\r\n<p>Movement: Left thumbstick<br/>Look/Aim: Right thumbstick<br/>Jump: \"A\" / Face Button Down<br/>Shoot: Right Trigger<br/>Crouch: Gamepad Shoulder (Hold), \"B\" / Face Button Right (Hold)<br/>Reload: \"X\" / Face Button Left<br/>Next Weapon: \"Y\" / Face Button Top, D-pad Up<br/>Previous Weapon: D-pad Down</p>\n<p>Credits<br/></p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Design and Programming: Justin Montgomery</p>\n<p>Art: Unreal marketplace and GameDev.TV</p>\n<p>Music: Unreal Marketplace and GameDev.TV</p>\n<p>Sound Effects: FreeSound.org</p>\n<p>Voice Acting: GameDev.TV and Justin Montgomery<br/></p>\r\nMade with Unreal Engine\r\n<p>Special Thanks: GameDev.TV for a great Unreal C++ course that got me started on this game from the \"Shooter Section\".</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-16T17:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/117/11714256333042d64473759627b15257.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 189, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GameSalutes"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
