Also I have only tested it on my i7 CPU and 780GTX. This is a game about cleaning your office. It's time to move the office and you are out of time... your good friend has accepted to do it for you! You can stop when you feel like you have done good enough job!</p><p>I don't have any programming skills so it's super simple on gameplay. I also ran out of time to even think about adding audio or music. I hope someone finds it fun. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e2c/e2ccee4b8e4d8f61c99a1d9cd8a9fba4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Markus"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
