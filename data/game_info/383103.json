I took <strong>Splatoon Mechanics </strong>and <strong>made it into a 2D game.</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to paint as much of the area before time runs out. To paint hold down the left mouse button and move around. To move use the W,A,S, and D keys or the arrow keys. The player looks toward the mouse so you can use that to aim. To go under the paint hold the\u00a0space key. There are areas where you cannot pass because you are too big, so you have to go under the paint and squeeze through the gap. But be careful because there are blue turrets that shoot you.</p>\n<p>In-game font used:\u00a0https://fontmeme.com/fonts/project-paintball-font/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-14T04:22:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/015/01582142fb6a6ad2a09d846f9a028795.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Zinkenite"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
