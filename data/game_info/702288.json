Alien Prop Hunt is an action packed team-based game where one team desperately tries to hide in plain sight, while the other relentlessly searches through environments to find them!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Your species came to this planet with one mission: Complete annihilation. Probably. Regardless, the local defense systems have been raised, and hunter drones are on their way to destroy you. Blend into the environment using your unique ability to take the exact form of any object you see. Try your best to blend in while you wait for a last minute rescue!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>You are humanity's first line of defense. A killing machine built to hunt and destroy enemy combatants. Use your weapons to shoot, blast, and snipe would-be invaders. Be quick, though, as there is not much time left before the aliens make their escape!</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>As an alien, you may feel defenseless, but worry not, for your forces have left strategically placed power-up vials to help you fight back. Pick one up on your way to hide, and use your new abilities to avoid detection and destruction!</strong><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T03:18:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/473/4733070ebfe4a9a82d6535f132478ea6.jpg", "website": "https://www.squiggly.games/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 415, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squiggly Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Squiggly Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
