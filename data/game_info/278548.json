What about make some logical\u00a0game?\u00a0Damm\u00a0I\u00a0like\u00a0Portal\u00a0game...</p>\n<p>Here it is. You can meet GLaDOS in her pixelated beautifulnes, and official voice lines from Portal wiki(Big thanks). To bring into game right feel of Portal, I need good sounds, so Valve give me official sounds...just kidding on YouTube channel GameSoundEffect(Also big thanks) are all Portal sounds and many more.</p>\n<p>This game take me more than 2 months, so i hope that you will see some progress.
