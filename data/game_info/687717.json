It is really short but there is a start and a finish. I really wanted to add more stuff to the end and more abilities to the shop but I ran out of time. This is more of an idea then a proper game.</p>\n<p>All visual effects are from \"Polygon Arsenal\" and audio from SidearmStudios. Everything else was made by me.</p>\n<p>KNOWN BUGS:</p>\n<p>Don't pause while fading into level.</p>\n<p>Wall jump disables jump sound.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T06:14:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c26/c268010fa3cebb675042b186354b3c76.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mr_Martenzo"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
