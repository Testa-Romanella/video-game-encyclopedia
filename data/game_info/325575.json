{"id": 325575, "slug": "dont-look", "name": "Don't Look", "name_original": "Don't Look", "description": "Don't Look is a horror game where you are being hunted by things that can only move when you see them. You feel a surging urgency to escape this... place. You MUST escape. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way out is through. While you have no weapon and no way you can defend yourself, you are lucky enough to discover the weakness of your hunters. They may have you trapped in a place where something feels.... off, but by not looking at them you might just be able to escape. With no explanation or recollection of where you came from your only objective is to survive and make it out of that hell and hopefully uncover some secrets on the way.
