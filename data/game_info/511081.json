Taking over all of the planet Earths defence systems, it demands to be entertained by competing against them in a classic game of Pong... And you're the chosen one! Win and humanity shall prevail. Lose, and humanity's hope will be lost forever! You only have to score four points to win!<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Ponxiety is the first game I've ever worked while learning Lua and Love2D. Instead, it's a game that came from CS50 course &amp; Kyle Schaubs course that opened me up to Love2D dev, but I wanted to give its personal touch! By all means, the game isn't perfect, but it's a creation that I'm happy with, and one that taught me a lot.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>at01\u00a0Pixel\u00a0Font\u00a0-\u00a0GrafxKidVictory music - NyetiCS50 &amp; their amazing course that taught me a lot</p>\n<p>Love2D for creating an amazing and easy to use game framework<br/></p>\n<p>A big thank you to GameFromScratch community for support &amp; Love2D discord community. <br/></p>\n<p>Special thank you to <br/></p>\n<p>Imre Barta and Safad for the support and testing.</p>\n<p>Kyle Schaub for his Lua &amp; Love2D course on udemy that is one of my favourite courses I've ever purchased and I highly recommend to anyone starting off.</p><p>My wife for her amazing work on the icon and graphics, and always supporting me with my adventure into gamedev.<br/></p>\n<p>And yes, trust me!
