Get a free copy of my other insane\u00a0experience\u00a0Crazy Kung Fu if you complete the above task. Just upload a video clip of you riding the beast to your twitter with the tags #fieldofivion #distantnightmare and send me the link on Discord!</p>\n<p>Discord: https://discord.gg/hjupHpa<br/>Crazy Kung Fu: https://bit.ly/ckfquest</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Here's a free Halloween special game. If you like cycling, this one is for you. Well, it's actually nothing like cycling. The controls are a bit more like riding a chariot. But that's part of the nightmare.</p>\n<p>This is an infinite runner style game, with some strange controls, many weird environments, various unlockage absurd bikes and eery music. You'll love it! Nothing better than strange, weird, absurd and eery things to kick off the Halloween season with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh and if it's not hellish enough for you, there's a time trial mode as well. Adds that extra kick in the face of WATCH THE TIME while also AVOIDING INSTANT DEATH.</p>\n<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>\n<p>If it's too hard for you let me know on Discord and maybe I can add a tricycle for you in the next update.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T05:45:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ea5/ea571608b45b9446e316600ff7e15cc0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Field Of Vision"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
