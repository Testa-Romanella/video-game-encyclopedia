Who needs conflict when you got bullets?</p>\n<p>The gman:<br/>\"We were actually planning on making a DM similar to Quake 3 arena, but for half-life, because the creator thought Half-life needed better multiplayer.<br/>But due to depression and general lack of motivation of the creator, Not much was done on this game actually. So just...play around in the main level, shoot guns, Push Control to spawn what would have been enemies, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Basically this whole game is a metaphor of Half Life 3, since not much work is being done on it, you're still waiting. In that sense it very much captures the atmosphere of Half Life 3.\"</p>\n<p>controls are wsad, 123 for weapons, shoot with mouse Reload with R CTRL to spawn enemies, G to restart the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-10-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c4a/c4a755ffeca779821ec1cd5fa8ee9bba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["M1sty"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
