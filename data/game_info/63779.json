There is a chase battle, but there is no big CG map of terrorism. Everyone can eat it with confidence. The elements of the game's storyline are relatively fragmented. Each level and item has its own special meaning. The complete storyline needs to be finalized after finishing, and it is more brain-burning.<br/><br/>[Basic button]<br/>Move: arrow keys or small number pad<br/>Survey/confirmation: Z, space, carriage return<br/>Menu, Cancel: X, Esc<br/>Running: Shift<br/>Back to heading: F12", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78dbcd1ee85435934f6245dd19baf99a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u6b87\u8475(K.)"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ningbing Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
