In an effort to combat this, a group of scientists and engineers developed a new form of transportation - the AutoRacer.\r\n</p>\n<p>These vehicles were equipped with cutting-edge technology that allowed them to move quickly and safely along designated highways. The highways were built high above the city, weaving in and out of skyscrapers and offering incredible views of the urban landscape.\r\n</p>\n<p>But the AutoRacers were not without their dangers. As more and more people took to the highways, accidents became increasingly common. In response, the AutoRacer Association was formed to regulate and promote safe driving practices.\r\n</p>\n<p>To test the skills of its members, the Association developed a series of challenges that took place on the highways themselves. These challenges were designed to push drivers to their limits, with obstacles like other cars, construction zones, and even explosive devices placed along the way.\r\n</p>\n<p>As a new member of the Association, you'll have to prove yourself by completing these challenges and showing that you have what it takes to be a true AutoRacer. With every coin and power-up you collect along the way, you'll move closer to becoming the ultimate champion of the highways. But be careful - one wrong move could mean disaster for you and your car. Will you rise to the challenge and become the top AutoRacer in the world?\r\n</p>\n<p>A simple racing game inspired by subway surfers.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>Art by me</li><li>Sounds from jsfxr and foley</li><li>Music generated by cgmusic and mixed by me</li><li>Lore by chatGPT</li></ul>\n<p>Source code: https://github.com/FinFetChannel/autoRacer</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T10:13:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/343/343c4bd86f3f28b0393c9499d6c09a85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Android"], "developers": ["FinFET channel"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
