If you don\u2019t know what a term means, not to worry!  Just push the \u201cdefinition\u201d button and you will see a playful (yet accurate) definition that is sure to make you laugh even harder!  <br/>\u2022\tFor 4 or more people, each team acts out the same term at the same time so feel free to sneak a peek at the other team\u2019s actor.
