This is a game about building a space ship and trying to fly it through an asteroid field, except building a working ship is really hard. Pieces fall from the top like in tetris, and you have to figure out where they would best fit on your ship in order to have it controllable and protected. Good for a solid 15-20 minutes of fun until you either get frustrated or make it to the end (whichever comes first). Good luck and happy trucking!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-10T10:08:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/759/759b8fa156d33efbfa33095d0b175a5e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["jiggly joe"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
