Generate random levels, make the game easier by having the ability to heal when rescuing hostages, or make the game harder by making you missiles able to kill citizens, heavily decreasing your score! Also added a black civilian sprite for better equality between soldiers and civilians.</p><p><strong>CREDITS:\u00a0<br/></strong>Code: Gregory Weber\u00a0https://gregoryweber.itch.io/<br/>Art: Kalponic Games\u00a0https://kalponic-games.itch.io<br/>Sound: jperez\u00a0https://www.jperezmusic.com</p>\n<p>NOTE: This is a submission to the Weekly Game Jam 152, the theme being \"Shelter\". There are also some ratio issues that I hopefully fix later, full screen should fix those issues for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Ace Pilot Cody<br/></strong><strong>Pilot a jet and save the hostages!<br/></strong>This entire game was made within a one week period. If the game is too hard, turn on easier difficulty in the option menu. This will allow you to heal for every civilian you save. Levels can also be randomly generated in the options menu.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T04:26:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/240/240724b4a424128bdf2d0ab220e2b548.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["gregoryweber"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
