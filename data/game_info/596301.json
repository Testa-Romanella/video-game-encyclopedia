I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>This is a short non-violent game that I really enjoyed making - especially the art and level design. People who follow me online know that I go on lots of countryside walks and I sometimes post photos of me sitting on something staring into space with the caption \"Where's my computer gone?\". This game is an homage to that series of photos, and to a certain computer (play to the end to find out more!)<br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T17:49:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/661/6611e5224141b352372dff044e19a615.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grey Alien Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
