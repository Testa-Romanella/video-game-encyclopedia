The concept is: you are Woo, the henchman in the beginning of the Big Lebowski, who threatens and pees on the rug of the \"wrong Lebowski\" for his boss, Jackie Treehorn.\u00a0</p><p>In this game, determined to never pee on the wrong rug again, Woo asks Mr. Treehorn to train him in the ancient art of recognizing the correct rug designs and peeing on those rugs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To play the game, scratch off the\u00a0design on the pad of paper, and control your urine to pee on the design that is exposed. Hoping to have all the game things you'd expect soon, but for now at least the mechanics work.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and Abide,<br/>Ford Timelord</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-12T10:45:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5a2/5a28b41d3aa3ea88a054c076f61b5b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["fordtimelord"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
