Players must collect up a good variety of objects to liberate the automated vacuum freedom from the house. The player must also watch their battery as if it runs out, it\u2019s game over.<br/></p>\n<p>For the theme of, \u201cOut of Control\u201d, we have chosen to go with the idea that the Vacuum has gone rogue and is planning to suck up the world. Additionally, as the player expands, they also become more difficult to control.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong><br/></p>\n\n<p>GMTK Jam Team:<br/>Programming by Matt Way.<br/>Game Design by Ellis Sutherland.<br/>Music and Sounds by Ethan Morran (https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ZjBM2wPUklLRsfoB11gVC?si=a7tWgdyqQpOl5mZ4s6GEXg)</p>\n<p>Game Assets:<br/>Icons by Sbed and Delapouite (game-icons.net)<br/>Game Assets and Asset Forge Tool by Kenney (kenney.nl)<br/>Sounds by Fesliyan Studios (https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T09:50:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c81/c81da808ba215ac212176d46ca23a122.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MattWay"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
