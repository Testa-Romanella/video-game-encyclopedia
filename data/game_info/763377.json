As of today, the game is a WORK IN PROGRESS. If you see this message, it means I am working on it. When this message disappears it means the full game has arrived. </strong></p>\n<p>A reanimated corpse (that being you), a sentient ring, and an amnesiac fiend walk into a bar. Sounds like the beginning of a bad joke? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s your life from the moment you woke up on a morgue slab.</p>\n<p>Your number one priority? Escape the clutches of the mad Warlock. You\u2019re an (aspiring? re-aspiring? You\u2019ve done it once already, damn it) eldritch being, not a lab rat! \r\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>lore-heavy interactive story (linear with choices),\r\n</li><li>custom MC (name, pronouns, personality),\r\n</li><li>2 gender-changeable ROs + 1 hidden route, *</li><li>9 illustrations to collect, *</li><li>X time and words per single playthrough.*</li></ul>\n<p>*in the full game.</p>\n<p><strong>Genre:</strong> dark fantasy, romance<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Warnings: </strong>This game is intended for a mature audience and includes topics such as:\u00a0slight gore, body-horror, temporary amnesia (not MC), depersonalization, mention of past child neglect (not MC), small spaces, coffins, depictions of violence, themes of death, mentions of mind-altering substances, suggestive themes (nothing explicit but one of the ROs <em>is</em> a cambion. [half-demon offspring of an incubus, succubus, or other demon and a human.])</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.Is WYC:Reprise a direct sequel to\u00a0</strong>I\u2019m the Echo when You call<strong>?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Yes and No. This game can be considered an AU, and it follows the Ending 4 of ItEwYc. If you achieved another ending, this game doesn\u2019t happen in that universe. That doesn\u2019t mean Ending 4 is the canon one: it\u2019s an interactive fiction, there\u2019s no such thing as canon. I just wanted to explore the setting more.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>2. Do I need to read ItEwYc before playing WYC:Reprise to understand what\u2019s going on?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Nope! Between ItEwYc and WYC:R passes three hundred years. MC can be easily considered a completely different person and their past is irrelevant save for a plot point that will be explained at large during the game.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>3. What happened to Echo???</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Play and find out! [Hint: Echo\u2019s not dead]\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>4. When will the whole game be finished?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>5. Will the full game be paid?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Yup! Around 7 USD, depending on how many extra features I end up implementing.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>6. Will this be a partial or full release?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Full release! I\u2019ll upload the game in parts (as soon as they are done) on Patreon, then once the entire game is finished it will be released here.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Can I record/share/stream/etc the playthrough?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Yes, but only the common route so as to not spoil the entire plot. Additionally, please refrain from posting \u2018no-commentary\u2019 videos.

Bound in a contract seemingly without an end, [he/she] was made to serve the Warlock\u2019s every whim... or would have been, if the Warlock remembered drafting the contract in the first place.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Name </strong>(given by the Warlock): Pluvia\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>True name:</strong> ???\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alias:</strong> the Fiend\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Likes:</strong> food, literature, peace, and quiet\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes: </strong>cheerful people, mornings, violence\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Which parts of Pluvia\u2019s personality presented due to amnesia and which are carved into [his/her] core is hard to guess. The fiend is a bit of a stuck-up, though curious and rather bold. The eloquent way of speaking suggests that back home [he/she] carried some sort of position, be it an official or a courtier. It couldn\u2019t have been anything major, though, otherwise somebody would have been sent to find [him/her] by now.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Trivia:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>doesn\u2019t remember [his/her] past, but somehow remembers most, if not all, stories [he/she]'s read. Likes to quote them often,\r\n</li><li>forever hungry, Pluvia likes to eat, but is never satisfied.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>The Ring:</strong> a petty thief sentenced to death by hanging, only to end up in the Warlock\u2019s hands. The first successful attempt at the body-soul separation, and thus a valuable member of the Warlock\u2019s collection of oddities.\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Name </strong>(</strong>given by the Warlock): Carcer\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>True name: </strong>N/A\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alias:</strong> the Ring\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Likes:</strong> music, storms, \"three good things\u201d game\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> silence, authority, injustice\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> [his/her] good-humored, happy-go-lucky attitude seems to rub Pluvia the wrong way. Carcer doesn\u2019t worry about that. Well, [he/she] doesn\u2019t worry much about anything, at least, not since [he/she] died \u2018on a technicality.' Carcer would \u2018strongly prefer\u2019 to have [his/her] body back, but seeing as it\u2019s no longer possible, [he/she] is determined to make the best of this\u00a0un-life.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Trivia:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>the mood ring changes colors to suit Carcer\u2019s... you guessed it, mood. The choice of a ring was purely accidental, though,\r\n</li><li>in [his/her] new \u2018container\u2019 Carcer can\u2019t see nor smell, but [his/her] auditory perception and tactile sense are greatly improved.\r\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>The Warlock: \u00a0a case in point that with immortality comes a great... decrease in sanity.\u00a0There's not much to be said about [him/her] other than the rumors. Some say [he/she] having the morals of a toddler, plays with all sorts of creatures as though they are dolls with re-attachable limbs. Others insist that [his/her] actions have a reason. They all agree, though, that aside from collecting rare artifacts, ???\u2019s interest zones on experiments and experiments alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>True name:</strong> ???\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alias:</strong> the Warlock\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Likes</strong>: forgotten knowledge, rare artifacts, people-watching\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> touch, noise, lies\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Personality:</strong> cold, apathetic, absent-minded. <strong>At least that's what you've heard.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trivia:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul><li>likes naming things. All the things. Yes, even you,</li><li>might or might not have been cursed at least once in the past.
