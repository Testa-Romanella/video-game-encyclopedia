Mostly a pashion project.</p>\n<p>All assets have been taken from Unreal Engine Marketplace and some I made myself. (yes I\u00a0did the code by myself other than the template movement code)</p>\n<p>There are 2 Gamemodes(Might add more later):</p>\n<p>-Survive: Survive for as long as you can against the \"monster\", the monster can be slowed down with bullets. After a minute, every player will recieve an AR. after 5 total minutes have passed all players will recieve a shotgun.</p>\n<p>-Adventure: You have to collect 10 car batteries to repair your car and go back on the road. You can also find a couple of AR's and shotguns in this gamemode. The monster spawns very far away from you in this mode, so you'll be safe for the first minute or so.</p>\n<p>How to play the game:</p>\n<p>-WASD to move and use your mouse to look around<br/>-Left Mouse Click to fire<br/>-You can equip the Pistol with the 1 key, AR with 2 and shotgun with 3 (if you have them in your inventory of course.)<br/>-F for the Flashlight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T10:29:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4a/b4ab814a7ce1f0103a5d9da219825b0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kuars14"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
