Of course, all AI must be tested before assigning them to said jobs, but what better place is there to test it than at an airport security bay?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here, you will be playing as an AI named Kaiser, who has been assigned with profiling passengers before they go to their gate terminal. Each passenger has a report, that you must match with the passenger themselves, while keeping an eye out for a \"BAD\" label.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone that has been assigned with \"BAD\" must be sent to their deaths.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There might be a chance that the AI could malfunction and lead to a couple of casualties, but the government is willing to take the risk for the sake of society.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>You only need a mouse to play this game.</p>\n<p><strong>Side Note\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>This game was made in 3 days for the Wowie 4.0 Game Jam. <br/>There were 4 people who made this game and this was a blast to make.
