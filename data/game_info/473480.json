It was later ported as a DVD game and for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PlayStation Portable (PSP). The story, a dramatic slice-of-life, follows Makoto Ito, a high school student who becomes the ambivalent love interest of several girls during his second term, and the effects this has on himself and his relationships with other characters. Though the game requires little interaction from users, School Days engages the player through a plot that they are given opportunities to change the course of during play. The game concludes with an ending specific to the outcome of the story, some of which became notorious for their graphic violence.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2005-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T11:35:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c4/1c45493408a373ed376ab4ceae9b4bcd.jpg", "website": "http://schooldays.us/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "beaten": 8, "dropped": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 5, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 4, "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 2", "PSP"], "developers": ["Regista", "0verflow"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": ["Overflow", "Interchannel"], "esrb_rating": null}
