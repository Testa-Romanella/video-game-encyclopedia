I don't have a programmer or pixel art background so definitely the art is not final (it even contains borrowed art from GB Studio template!) and the rest of the gameplay needs a lot of polish and features (like limiting the use of attacks with an stamina bar for instance) as for the moment I'm limited by the science of my era (or my brain to be exact).\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>For the music, I tag teamed (no pun intended I swear!) with\u00a0TipTopTomCat\u00a0who has done a badass work with the chiptunes. Hope you enjoy his music and I invite you to\u00a0visit his twitter\u00a0@TomcatTiptop. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out the amazing first volume of the soundtrack at:</p>\n\n<p>SoundCloud</p>\n<p>In the meantime I'll keep learning as much as I can\u00a0for you guys to get a demo\u00a0version this year!\u00a0Kindly\u00a0report any bugs or glitches you might find. Feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-08T09:37:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c97/c979115f3505c2369eae3aea853677a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Bricks VGS - Rodolfo"], "genres": ["RPG", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
