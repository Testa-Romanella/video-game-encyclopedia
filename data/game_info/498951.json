My second game. I concentrated quite hard on making it feel as polished as I\u00a0could!</p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun doing cinematics and getting the skull to feel satisfying to throw around. Bonk. Bonk. Rattle rattle.<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><em>You might want to stop playing after you reach the foot as the rest is not playtested... or maybe just after your second death. In retrospect, I should have gone for playtesting over panicking and trying to add more content an hour before the deadline... ha.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Escape - toggle menu</li><li>Click &amp; Drag - Move skull</li><ul><li>If you find movement too difficult, there's a setting you can adjust in the accessibility menu (I didn't test this! Good luck)</li></ul></ul>\n<p><strong>When to stop:</strong></p>\n<p>After the foot powerup there's nothing playtested.</p>\n<p>I ran out of time trying to get the level design in. I rush job added in some extra level beyond getting the foot powerup but I'm not even sure you'll be able to reach it! Sorry about that.</p>\n<p><strong>How it fits the theme:</strong></p>\n<p>There and back - I had the idea for a game where you were outrunning something in order to collect power ups (the \"there\") and if caught you end up back at the start (the \"back\") - but you get to keep the power ups, so as you play you can go further and further.</p>\n<p>I ran out of time before I\u00a0could implement too much of the level design unfortunately, but hopefully it gets the idea across :)</p>\n<p><em>-Lila</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-28T05:40:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e20/e206a9e31b79700fefaa6efa72879e74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Lila Alindrome"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
