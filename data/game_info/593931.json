(Feature still in development, not present on current builds) - Rice Bowls, that serve as checkpoints - And Water Bottles, they're basically like coins.</p>\n<p>On later builds, you'll be able to turn these on or off, they're all enabled on the most recent build.</p>\n\n<p>There's a debug command (C KEY) that lets you automatically beat any level. Only the first 2 are playable. Only Windows is supported for now, the game may run on wine. IDK though.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T07:15:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/674/6740d4894ac50aa8624fd34c89505c8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["mikray"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
