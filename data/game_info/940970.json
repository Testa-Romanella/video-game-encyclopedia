Donned with torches and ropes (and maybe more equipment\u00a0along the way), you will attempt to descend from the mountain as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Be warned, the ground is precarious and rapid avalanches are rendering most of the paths useless without torches. In addition, several caverns have developed in the side of the mountain, impassable without a steady supply of\u00a0ropes. There may even be Yetis far scarier than you as you descend the mountain path.</p>\n<p>Make your way through level 10, and you may just survive to find a new home.</p>\n<p>Resources:<br/><br/>Manaseed Winter Pack:\u00a0https://seliel-the-shaper.itch.io/winter-forest<br/>Oryx Fantasy Tile Set:\u00a0https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/products/16-bit-fantasy-tileset</p>\n<p>Yeti Sprite:\u00a0https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-yeti-sprites<br/><br/>Soundtrack\u00a0(Mythica):\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/mythica<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:18:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1f1/1f16aa3b90eb5d98bdd1676ecc489e3f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 95, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["newtnewtnewt"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
