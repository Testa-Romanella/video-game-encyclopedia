Since sombreros are allergic to water, the whole population flees to the north. Despite the rising water, they are not too bad about their traditions and hold regular siestas. Some of them could even take home goods. But in the north, there is a president. He is afraid for his job thinking of being no longer the only inhabitant. Determined to stop any immigrant trying to reach one of his four villages.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction -\u00a0</strong>On a golf cart, armed with a water pistol, the goal of the player is to prevent the arrival of invading sombreros. The sombreros slip through the holes of the border wall and walk to one of the four villages. On their way, the player should try to stop them by firing or running over. For each destruction, the player receives dollars credited to his account and is occasionally rewarded with PowerUps. It is important to survive as long as possible while keeping his account covered with dollars. Once a sombrero has reached a village, dollars are deducted from the player. If the account falls into the minus or the player loses all his health, the game is over: the president is destitute and his country is overrun.</p>\n<p><strong>Philosophy -\u00a0</strong>All characters and events in this game, even those based on real people, are entirely fictional. This game focuses on entertainment, and does not represent political opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>Genre -\u00a0</strong>Single player third-person shooter with tower defense elements.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-11-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d0/3d0c34c007a05b1bd1182bddf256dc1e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garimann"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
