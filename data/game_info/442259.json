{"id": 442259, "slug": "dungeon-thing", "name": "Dungeon Thing", "name_original": "Dungeon Thing", "description": "<p>Hello all, this is my very late\u00a0submission to the DOS Game Jam. It was finished months after the jam ended, due to some bugs that I didn't feel like dealing with with a looming deadline,\u00a0but I'd say it turned out well enough to publish anyways. I had planned to make it web playable, but Unity wouldn't let me for some reason. Apologies for the inconvenience.<br/></p>\n<p>This is a game where you fight through a dungeon, as implied by its title. It's a text based game, so I can't really show you any cool, action-packed screenshots. Oh well.</p>\n<p>In aforementioned dungeon, you will fight against many foes through effective timing of your attacking, defending, item usage, and <em>not</em> fleeing. Seriously, any fleeing of\u00a0any and all battles in this game does literally nothing and triggers no extra dialogue!</p>\n<p>Before you start wasting your time with this thing, here are some tips that might come in handy:</p>\n<ul><li>Music can be muted with the \"s\" key. (Not sure why you would want to do that though. The singular tune is \"fire\", \"groovy\", and some other third thing the \"kids\" say these days!)</li><li>An enemy's interest in the battle at hand increases as the battle goes on, except on turns when you're defending. ('Cos defending is\u00a0<strong>boring!!!</strong>)</li><li>My previous statement about the uselessness of fleeing was 2/5 a lie. (That makes it 3/5 truth, which makes me 3/5 not a liar!)</li><li>Press escape for a convenient and instant\u00a0rage quit!</li><li>When it comes to gardening, the best\u00a0defence is the best\u00a0way to not die!</li></ul>\n<p>Now pretend I said something cool and witty that convinces you to play the game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-11T04:24:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/279/2799a89bca8b0b3df9493b13c2c21b97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Fover"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
