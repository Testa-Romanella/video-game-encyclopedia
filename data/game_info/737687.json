You are the CDC commander and must place limited resources to stop the spread of the virus. The game is a top-down Virtual Board Game. The way you play is by selecting a discovery character after placing a few click research, this will advance the turn and allow the virus to spread unless you found it! If you find the virus, make sure to send out a vaccine agent to clear it! You must stop the virus from spreading before it takes over 50% of the US. Currently the resource system isn't functional, so you are free to put down as many people as you want, to make it fun try to limit yourself to 3 moves a turn! Also, as soon as you make a space immune it will say you have won. However, the virus is still spreading, and you can keep playing. Thanks!\r\n</p>\n<p>Global Game Jam 2017<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T10:27:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c2a/c2af3e4da5812fa52486cc30f7bb04c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mike Huseman"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
