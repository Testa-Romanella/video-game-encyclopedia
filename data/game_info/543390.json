CLIPPING THROUGH WALLS IS INEVITABLE. INFINITE DEATH CHECKPOINTS ARE POSSIBLE TO MAKE.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Basically, you control a ball that sticks to walls, but only when it feels like it. The ball wants to get back home, but he'll have to go through an endless series of tests to get there.</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold click to stick to a wall upon impact.</li><li>Aim while sticking to aim in a different direction.</li><li>Release to release.</li><li>Click on the ball to set a checkpoint, but it costs 1 life to do so.</li><li>Don't touch red stuff.</li><li>Make it to the green.</li></ul>\n\n<p>And that's it! That's the whole game! Thanks for playing (if you did play, that is)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-15T06:04:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b5c/b5c01640021e973a74dd924b67904197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Extem The Hedgehog"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
