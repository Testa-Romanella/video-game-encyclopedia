You're able to move to the next level by moving to a teleport (the purple swirly thingy), but only after you kill all enemies, present in the room.</p>\n<p><em><strong>LOUD MUSIC WARNING, PLEASE DO LOWER IT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED... or don't, if you want extra immersion\u00a0<em>:))</em></strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>--------- CONTAINS FLASHING 64x64 TILES AND SPRITES, PLAYERS PRONE TO SEIZURES, DISCRETION ADVISED -----------</strong></em></p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this extensive description, I spent like 15 mins on it &lt;3</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T12:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/412/41245dca8ecf1d6558ce52b11d781edc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["thediamondinferno"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
