Look no further than \"Fortnight Tower Defense: Goofy Ahh Meme Game\"!\r\n</p>\n<p>This game will make you question your life choices and wonder why you ever bothered to spend money on it. The graphics are so bad that they will make your eyes bleed and your brain cells die. You'll be trapped in a world of janky animations, distorted character models, and poorly rendered backgrounds that will make you want to gouge out your own eyeballs.\r\n</p>\n<p>The gameplay is beyond boring. You'll spend hours mindlessly clicking on the same towers over and over again, with no real strategy or challenge involved. The enemies are so weak that you'll wonder if they're even trying to attack your base. And don't even get me started on the \"Goofy Ahh\" sound effect - it's so annoying that it will make you want to throw your computer out the window.\r\n</p>\n<p>The towers themselves are a joke. You'll only have a handful to choose from, and they all look and function the same. There's no sense of progression or accomplishment as you upgrade them, because you'll barely notice any difference in their effectiveness.\r\n</p>\n<p>And let's not forget about the story (or lack thereof). There's no plot to speak of, no character development, and no motivation to keep playing. You're just mindlessly defending your base against generic enemies that have no personality or purpose.\r\n</p>\n<p>In short, \"Fortnight Tower Defense: Goofy Ahh Meme Game\" is a complete waste of time, money, and brain cells. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away from this abomination of a game.\r\n</p>\n\n\n<p>Minimum system requirements:<br/></p>\n<p>Windows 7</p>\n<p>Processor and Graphics Card: literally anything better than a potatoe will work</p>\n<p>If I think about it a little longer a potatoe will prbably work as well</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T19:06:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f56/f5605d5e8148e4a082a599a9ad6a2ff1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EightOhFour"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
