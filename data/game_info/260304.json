You'd think that the highest possible number would be 216 (65536), which would fill up the board, making it impossible to progress. However, if you do manage to spawn a 4 tile as your last tile, then you can continue to progress to 217 (131972).<br/>Scoring works like this;<br/>Merging two lower tier blocks together will give you the score of the higher tier block (score of +8 gained from merging two 4's). For any specific tile score, you have to add up all the scores from the lower tiers.<br/>Creating a 2 tile = +0pts<br/>Creating a 4 tile = 4 = +4pts<br/>8 = 8 + 2x4 = +16pts<br/>16 = 16 + 2x8 + 4x4 = +48pts<br/>32 = 32 + 2x16 + 4x8 + 8x4 = +128pts ...<br/>Which can be simplified;<br/>Tile 21 = 0 x 21 = 0pts<br/>Tile 22 = 1 x 22 = 4pts<br/>Tile 23 = 2 x 23 = 16pts<br/>Tile 24 = 3 x 24 = 48pts<br/>Making tile 2n = (n-1)2n points.<br/>Making the max tile (217 ) = 16 x 217 = 2,097,152 points. You would need to spawn 65,536 '2' tiles to make a single 131,072 tile, which, at 1 legal move/s, would take 18.2 hours.<br/>That's only making the max tile now. we still need to fill the rest of the board. (Note: combining times are correct, as when you merge 2 tiles together, you spawn a '2' at the same time)<br/>Next tile 216 = 983,040 points (215 tiles/9.1 hours)<br/>215 = 458,752 points (214 tiles/4.55 hours)<br/>214 = 212,992 points (213 tiles/2.27 hours)<br/>213 = 98,304 points (212 tiles/1.13 hours)<br/>212 = 45,056 points (211 tiles/34 mins)<br/>211 (2048) = 20,480 points (210 tiles/17 mins)<br/>1024 = 9,216 points (29 tiles/8.5 mins)<br/>512 = 4,096 points (28 tiles/4.3 mins)<br/>256 = 1,792 points (27 tiles/2.1 mins)<br/>126 = 768 points (26 tiles / 64 seconds)<br/>64 = 320 points (25 tiles /32 seconds)<br/>32 = 128 points (16 tiles/16 seconds)<br/>16 = 48 points (8 tiles/8 seconds)<br/>8 = 12 points (3 tiles/3 seconds) [This space will be created by two '2' tiles, and the last '4' tile. so -4 points from the equation]<br/>This fills up 15/16 spaces on the board. We don't include the last tile, as it cannot merge with the 8.<br/>Max points possible = 3,932,156 Points. 131,070 (+1 for last tile, -1 for the 4) tiles spawned. Around 35.5 hours @ 1 move/s.<br/>If you happen to miss out on the last '4' tile, your max score would be 1,835,008, 65,535 (+1 for last tile) '2' tiles spawned, 18.2 hours @ 1 move/s.<br/><br/>From: http://www.reddit.com/r/2048/comments/214njx/highest_possible_score_for_2048_warning_math/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:59:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bcd/bcd45c16078b41ed4bb44db76c277a44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 28, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Xuehui Wu"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Xuehui Wu"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
