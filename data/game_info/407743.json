The ideia is you\u00a0create your character, start from nothing, then you start grownup your skills etc. start working in a normal work like blacksmith, Baker, bricklayer / Builder etc. but if you want to be a soldier or maybe a king, or just an adventurous guy you can. This is the main idea of the game, be free to live a life of a person in a procedural fantasy world,\u00a0 to be whatever you want, don't just a human, but a elf, orc, or other thing.</p>\r\nCurrent Features\r\n<ul><li>Procedural world</li><li>Procedural Biomes</li><li>(ALPHA) Procedural Villages</li><li>(DEV) Multiplayer system</li><li>(ALPHA) Inventory system</li><li>Basic combat system</li></ul>\r\nFuture Features\r\n<ul><li>City/Villages player\u00a0build system</li><li>Interact with NPCs(Talk, Fight, Trade, Stole)</li><li>Strategy Battle System(you can be a army general)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-31T02:51:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c5776df37b8b0e3ce6cf16b79647e6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Darkcomsoft"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
