Really cool experience to try out together, the game is nowhere near finished but it was fun and we didn't feel the need to pressure ourselves too much pulling all-nighters. <br/></p>\n<p>This is a two player game, though you have to carry the larger player frequently so honestly you could get away with playing this by yourself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Controls for the two players:</p>\n<p>James (larger blue dude):</p>\n<p>A and D for movement</p>\n<p>W to jump<br/></p>\n<p>Q,E for moving shield (once it is held down with S)</p>\n<p>Gam (smaller pink dude):</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrow keys for movement</p>\n<p>Up arrow key to jump and throw if you're carrying the other player</p>\n<p>Down arrow key to pick up the other player.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This was made by four people:</p>\n<p>Coding, Vape Mastery, Rocket League Addict,  Computer Hacking:</p>\n<p> Alex Matheson\u00a0 https://matho.me/<br/></p>\n<p>Coding and Trawling Through Terrible Royality Music Bios, Ya Standard Weeb, Gnarly Scooter Boi, Connoisseur of Pickled Onions and Hummus:</p>\n<p>Darcy Phillips\u00a0 phillda.non@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Art and Game Maker Wizard, Idubbz Impersonation, Individual of Good Video Game Taste, Drawing Ugly Creatures:</p>\n<p> Daniel Ferguson\u00a0 danielfergusonn@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Lousy Animations and Art, Cooker of Beanz, \u00a0Wears Caps Because He Doesn't Do His Hair,  Concept Artist Wannabe:</p>\n<p>Sal Fontaine \u00a0https://www.instagram.com/sal_fontaine/<br/></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we wanna say thanks to Mark and I'm assuming his team(?) for making really incredibly astute videos on video game mechanics and themes.<br/></p>\n<p>Good luck to everyone I hope you got something out of it.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-09-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d8/3d803ffe12b9b83d78d55704c7c63fec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["salfontaine"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
