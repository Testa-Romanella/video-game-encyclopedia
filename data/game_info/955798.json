One night, you and a group of others with the same problem decide to stay up all night to see what is going on- and all of you have your weapons at the ready. You all discover the issue, but law enforcers do not believe your story- so you are all on your own. Prices for bullets, cows, and resources to build stables go through the roof as all of you fight to keep your farms up and running.</p>\n\n<p>Use the mouse to aim, and left-click to shoot. After each round of invaders, you can buy from the store, but inflation can overtake you very quickly. To make matters worse, prices for purifying milk has also skyrocketed- it is so bad, that your profits are permanently $50 per cow. How long can you survive?</p>\n<p>This game is 100% free. I would love to hear your opinion on it!<br/></p>\n<p>Credits: UFOs, the main character, the barn, the tree, the telephone poll, and the fence are from Distant Lands; Skull and cross from Synty Studios; Music from Mike Berns Music; \u00a0Future Beeps LITE by Nirvanage; Explosions from Gamemaster Audio; Weapon is by 255 pixel studio; cow model and texture from Polyperfect; Moon by n4.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T08:43:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cef/cefc2376f6ffe66a8e697601c58c0d8c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Devs"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
