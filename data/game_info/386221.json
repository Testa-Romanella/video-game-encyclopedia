The game play is focused on controlled rocket flight and learning from your mistakes. Dying in the game will restart your progress.The game was made from the unity\u00a0 3D course on Udemy by Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson.</p><p>This game is incomplete but is in a playable state. The pauses in between each level were where a video played but Unity will not play videos on web builds so there is just an empty gap.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-25T07:09:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/518/518d447b61ee088f761fd1c69f669e3b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["hildetand"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
