'Don't come back until you find it', she says. It's probably in some fish's gut by now. Ah well, at least I have an excuse to do some fishin'. Hell of a way to spend my day off.\"<br/></em></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/></strong>WASD = steer boat<br/>Left mouse button = hold to aim lure, release to cast<br/>Right mouse button = hold to reel in lure</p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f\u00a0\ud83d\udc1f<br/></p>\n<p><strong>v0.1 KNOWN ISSUES:<br/></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes the lure doesn't properly collide with the water and just hangs there.
