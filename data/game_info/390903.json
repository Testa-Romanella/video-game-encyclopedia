This is the first complete game that I made using the Unity Engine. It took me around 50 hours! I made everything from scratch, except for the font and the music. The song that plays in the game is \"Spoken\" by UNFA. I really do hope you try it out, and maybe you'll like something about it, too! And if this isn't your cup of tea, try the game Catherine, or PQ2. Now those games are good (and also not made by me of course!). : )</p>\n<p>Also, if you want to play the game on your browser, click the link below!</p>\n<p>https://itch.io/embed-upload/1771748?color=000000<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-15T03:07:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c54/c548ce73a88f7b7b1b799ea00b7663b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Wilson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
