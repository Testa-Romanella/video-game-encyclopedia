You can remove notes. You can add notes only if you previously removed them. In this mode the game does everything for you and lets you do the thinking. You can switch back to manual mode - the auto-populated notes will remain.<br/>\u2022 Manual Mode - you are responsible for adding/removing notes. No restrictions.<br/>\u2022 Manual Mode with \"smart notes\" - you are responsible for adding/removing notes, but the game will auto cleanup the corresponding notes when you enter a new number. If you change your mind and remove the number the game will put them back. In manual mode you can use the \"Clear Notes\" button to clear all notes.<br/>\u2022 Clear notes - in manual mode delete/clear all user notes<br/>\u2022 Hide/Show notes - temporary hide/show notes in all modes<br/>\u2022 Hint - press the \"Hint\" button and one unknown number will be revealed<br/>\u2022 Mark-Completed feature - mark completed numbers with a star on the Notes Pad<br/>\u2022 Sudoku 16x16 MANUAL - you think it is too hard for you - no such thing - read the manual and you will be ready. <br/><br/>ALERT LEVELS:<br/>\u2022 OFF - No alerts<br/>\u2022 Conflicts Alert - When the entered number conflicts with another number on the same row, column or box it will be colored in red and you will hear an alert sound.

If a row, column or sub-square is populated with unique numbers and there is only one number left - double-tap the square - the remaining number will appear<br/>Double-tap shortcuts reduce the solving time by 10 - 20%.<br/><br/>NUMBER-FINDER FEATURE:<br/>When nothing is selected tap a number in the notes pad or in the number pad. All squares containing this note or this number will be highlighted;<br/>This feature will allow you to solve the puzzle much faster: 40% in AutoFill mode and 10% in Manual mode.<br/>For some players it is half of the fun to find the correct notes by themselves and solve it without any extra help.
