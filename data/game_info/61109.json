You'll do this by completing quests, collecting treasures, avoiding obstacles, and outsmarting your opponents as they try to do the same. <br/><br/>In Battle Squares you control your movement, your character, your items, and your abilities -- it's up to you to execute a winning strategy against the opposition.<br/><br/><strong>Character Selection</strong><ul><li>Choose from an array of unique characters each with their own twists and quirks. Utilize unique character abilities to gain the edge over other players.</li></ul><strong>Target Rolling</strong><ul><li>Dice-rolls aren't random -- With a little bit of practice, you can expertly manipulate your dice rolls to move how you want across the board. Just be careful-- if your opponents predict your moves, they'll be rewarded as well!</li></ul><strong>Dynamic Boards:</strong><ul><li>Each game plays on a procedurally-generated board that will change over the course of the game. The best players will adapt to and manipulate the board state to their advantage.</li></ul><strong>77+ Items:</strong><ul><li>Carefully tailor an item build to your preferred play-style -- stack up on combat stats to hold your own in battle, or use activatable items to bully your opponents between rounds. Each game presents endless possibilities.</li></ul><strong>10 Square Types:</strong><ul><li>As players move across the board, you'll find yourself bidding in auctions, casting spells on your enemies, stealing AP from other players, challenging others to duels, and more! </li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T12:11:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/358/358b012cbee4174a74f94caa5e7ffcd3.jpg", "website": "http://www.playbattlesquares.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 377, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Caleb Chalmers"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Atlas \"Incawporated\""], "esrb_rating": null}
