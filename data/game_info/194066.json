Do you have what it takes to reach a new limit?\u00a0 This game was inspired by an old dream of a future career, when i was younger my dream was to become a member of the Marine, to live fight and serve my Country. The Platypus was also one of my favorite animals growing up, such a weird creature so relating as a kid being weird and embracing the nerd and being recruited, working hard in training and being one of the few and the proud to be recognized as a member of the united states Marines</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/250/2501d7de141ec4488b61a894f1246897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android"], "developers": ["Harbinger1996"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
