Are you bored of swinging giraffe-sized battle axes made from dragon parts and dream of simply crafting a more comfortable hilt for your trusty (but slightly wonky) steel sword?<br/><br/>Here at Character Licensing Heroes Inc. (CLicHe), we know that you\u2019re sick of online role playing games which offer the same tired tropes like \u201cepic quests\u201d (overdone) and \u201cancient gods\u201d (give me a break).<br/><br/>We know that what you really want is a generic fantasy world, filled with exciting tasks like chopping wood, blacksmithing, and fishing (when we get around to developing it). So we\u2019re seeking adventurers who want to join us on a quest to line our pockets, uh, I mean enrich the vibrant world of Nuublandia by helping us with a few tasks.<br/><br/>And look, if you really want to risk your neck fighting the local monster population, there\u2019s a few dungeons in need of clearing out - but we\u2019re not shelling out for your health insurance.<br/><br/><br/>Sure, it sounds like a fast food slogan, but we mean it. There\u2019s no right or wrong way to enjoy Genfanad. <br/><br/>Whether you want to check in for an hour to craft yourself a nice cape, or meet up with some friends and harass some townsfolk (okay, so maybe there is a wrong way), you can play the game however you like.<br/><br/><br/>Look, we\u2019ve put in all this work building you a fantasy world - so you\u2019re going to have to earn your keep.<br/><br/>Genfanad offers you the chance to learn and master numerous skills that you can use to give back to high fantasy society and help keep the CLicHe lights on.<br/><br/>When Genfanad launches in full, you\u2019ll be able to turn your digital hands to fulfilling professions, such as Smithing, Mining and Butchery. Or, if that's too much for your soft hands, why not try Artistry, Botany or Cookery?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Some games break the fourth wall. We simply forgot to put one in ours. <br/><br/>A self-aware parody of beloved MMORPG legends like (insert huge MMORPG franchise that our lawyers won't let us mention here), manifested in the form of the world's most committed meme, Genfanad doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. <br/><br/>In fact, it doesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all. The one thing we are serious about? Giant rats.<br/><br/><br/>We don\u2019t like MMO games that drop content in your lap and expect you to rush through it all in one go, before it inevitably gets stale. Your membership to Genfanad will include new bite-size updates, with content dropped on a weekly basis, such as new areas and activities to enjoy, and additional skills to master.<br/><br/>Only have time to check in for an hour or two per week? That\u2019s fine. Genfanad is a constantly-evolving experience that encourages a relaxed playstyle. Of course, we\u2019re not going to stop you quitting your job and becoming a 24-hour Genfanad streamer, but you probably shouldn\u2019t do that.<br/><br/><br/>We know you hate fetch quests that ask you to go and collect five sprigs of parsley. We know, because we hate those too. <br/><br/>Quests in Genfanad are precisely that - quests. They\u2019re unique, they drive the story forward and - most importantly of all - they\u2019re fun.<br/><br/><br/>Sure, we want to get rich - who doesn\u2019t? But we\u2019d prefer to accumulate our swimming pools of cash from happy and regular players, not by selling useless hats.<br/><br/>We are building Genfanad to have a free tier and an optional low monthly fee for all of the content updates and other bonuses. No pay to win, no hidden fees, no XP boosts, no lootboxes.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-30T04:38:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/838/838f13f3ddd064977017f2bdb5a4760e.jpg", "website": "https://genfanad.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 225, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Rose Tinted Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Massively Multiplayer", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rose Tinted Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
