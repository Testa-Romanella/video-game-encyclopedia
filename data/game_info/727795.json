{"id": 727795, "slug": "rolling-in-the-sheepe", "name": "Rolling in the Sheepe", "name_original": "Rolling in the Sheepe", "description": "<p>The Sheepe are a simple folk. They are born with a random shape and one burning desire in their woolly heart: <em>cross the finish line before the others</em>!</p>\n<p>When they take their first rolls, though, they soon find out not every shape is equally suited for rolling. And in a weird twist of faith, the player in\u00a0<strong>last place</strong> magically turns into a <strong>wolf</strong> that eats the others!</p>\n<p><strong>Rolling in the Sheepe</strong> is a simple, light-hearted local multiplayer game for 1-6 players of all ages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Roll your sheepe to the finish. Try not to get sliced into many tinier sheepe along the way, or become The Unrollable Triangle, or land on a spike, or miss that jump ten times, or\u00a0- well, you know, just try to roll better than the others?</p>\n\n<p>This game is playable on <strong>Windows / Mac / Linux</strong> with both\u00a0<strong>Controllers &amp; Keyboard.</strong> (In any combination. Four keyboard players at most.)</p>\n<p>Each player only has two buttons: <strong>roll left</strong> and <strong>roll right</strong>. Rolling was never easier!</p>\n\n<p>Of course, for the really tricky bleaters among us, you can do more than roll.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Press both buttons to do a <strong>quick jump</strong>. Hold both buttons to <strong>float in the air</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many of the terrains play with your physics, such as the\u00a0<em>reverse gravity</em> or the\u00a0<em>spiderman</em> that clings to walls.</p>\n\n<p>For this game, I tried a new method to make\u00a0<em>learning</em> the game easier. When the game boots, you have only two options:</p>\n<ul><li>A\u00a0<strong>tutorial mode.</strong> When chosen, you play a special course designed to teach the basic buttons and objective, but nothing else.\r\n</li><li>A\u00a0<strong>free play mode.</strong> Anything can appear. But, before a new thing is added, a tutorial image also appears (right inside the level) that explains what's coming.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n<p>This way, you only need to play the tutorial once. Then you can free play, without requiring any upfront reading/learning, but it will be different every time and use all content of the game!</p>\n<p>If you did (not) like this system, let me know! It's something I experiment with. (Any other feedback is also greatly appreciated.)</p>\n<p>Additionally, the game has several mechanics to bring players closer together.\u00a0 The most important ones are ...</p>\n<p><strong>L</strong><strong>ocks</strong>: a minigame that the player(s) in the lead must solve before they can continue. They aren't just a catch-up trick, they are a\u00a0<em>core part of the game</em> and a challenge by itself!</p>\n<p><strong>Teleports:</strong> if you're too far behind, or did not move for too long, you're teleported forward. This does incur a\u00a0<em>time penalty</em> though, so even if you reach the finish first, you might not necessarily have the best time!<br/></p>\n\n<p>This game has:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>25 terrains</strong>. (While moving over them, their effect is active on you.)</li><li><strong>20 locks.</strong> (See explanation above.)</li><li><strong>40 obstacles.</strong> (Solid tiles can have obstacles on them, such as deadly spikes or trampolines.)</li></ul>\n<p>There is a\u00a0<strong>free demo</strong> to try the game. It has no restrictions, but only includes a handful of the elements, meaning the same things will appear each run.</p>\n\n<p>The game\u00a0<em>started</em> as part of my \"One Week Game\" series.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it became way bigger (and much different) than I originally imagined. And so I ended up working on it way longer, and eventually decided to become serious about it and bring the game to a paid release.</p>\n<p>(Also, the original core idea ended up not fitting with my other ideas, so I had\u00a0to redo the whole project from scratch.\u00a0That original core idea eventually became Carving Pumpkins &amp; Dwarfing Dumplings.)</p>\n<p>You can read about the whole development in my (extremely long and detailed) devlog: [Devlog] Rolling in the Sheepe</p>\n<p>The summary? It was hard, physics are annoying,\u00a0it became harder, and finally I just decided to finish what I had before I'd quit entirely in frustration.\u00a0I'm proud of what it is and think you'll have\u00a0great fun with it, but it's not for everyone, and could be more polished.</p>\n<p>I know, that's not smart to say in terms of <em>marketing</em>, but it's the truth. Game development is hard, I'm still learning :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-28T05:39:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2b/f2b3b820e9180d791e563e89d5b3b89e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
