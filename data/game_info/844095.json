The concept is around making sushi! On each level, the player starts as a simple rice ball and gets ingredients to become a full sushi by the end! Each piece also grants a different power to change the character's movement. Have fun!</p>\n\n<p>This platformer was made with three other people as a class project. My role in the teams was as one of the programmers, focusing on gameplay scripting, like controller and AI. This was my first larger project made, and I was pretty happy with the result of the character controller. Still have a lot to learn, but I think this was a good first step.
