Just don't do anything nefarious that alters our timeline while you are there.<br/><br/>New gameplay in a classic framework lets you grab and pull your enemies, make those enemies hit more enemies on the way to the wall which makes you experience joy.  But take care! Every attack can inadvertently result in your own death or the death of your friends. Then your friends will hate you and you will experience sadness. Sadness is the opposite of joy.
