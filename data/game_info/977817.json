As Robin, you\u2019ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime \u2013 all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you\u2019re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members\u2019 professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement\u2019s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.<br/><br/>As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.<br/>Can Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice? Their fate is up to you!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-17T10:14:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1f/d1f882f1a48d05804d2cd6e2e13db618.jpg", "website": "https://meanastronauts.pl/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 4, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 100, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 633, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MeanAstronauts"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["PlayWay"], "esrb_rating": null}
