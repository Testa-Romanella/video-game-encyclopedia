I've recently come back to it, patched it up a little and added more levels! The game now has 10 levels to play through, but the game should still only take 5-10 minutes to complete.</p>\n\r\nWhat's next?\r\n<p>Gatecrash isn't going to receive any major updates unless the game gets popular, but I'm currently working on my first 'Proper' game (Bar the dancer: definitive edition), which is called 'Voidside' (Search it up on youtube to find the devlogs). To help with the production of voidside,\u00a0<strong>donations</strong> on this game or purchases of the dancer: definitive edition on steam are greatly appreciated! :D</p>\n\n<p><em>(above is a voidside screenshot)</em><br/></p>\r\nHave Fun! - Spacepiano :D", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-26T12:37:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16bebe74cd0423a905274054bcc76f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Spacepiano Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
