The Captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign. We are now crossing a zone of turbulence. Please return your seats and keep your seat belts fastened. If you see something wrong, please address it, as our cabin crew has all fled the aircraft. Thank you. RIPAir is an airline that takes low-cost seriously, so the principle is \"you fly yourself\". Try to keep the plane flying as long as possible by repairing the engines as they get damaged! And remember, \"FLYING IS BETTER WITH FRIENDS!\"</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T05:24:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6e5/6e5a5218e674c82dce7be85cc826d24f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Christian Marques"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
