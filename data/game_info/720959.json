The King has many knights.<br />\n- Fighting with swords: the emphasis in the combat system is on melee weapons. In addition to normal attacks, knights can also push opponents away and parry their attacks.<br />\n- Items: There are a lot of items hidden in the dungeons that will help you in battles.<br />\n- Secret locations: a particularly attentive knight will be able to find secret corridors and halls, sometimes with tangible benefits for himself.<br />\n- Merchants: occasionally knights will find peaceful characters, and in secret locations they will be able to purchase amplifying artifacts from them.<br />\nThe technical side.<br />\n- I wrote the engine code in C++, this is a software renderer. This means that the whole picture is being built by the CPU forces.<br />\n- I used Code::Blocks, GCC, VisualStudio, Sleepy, Blender, GIMP, Audacity to create code, models, textures and sounds.<br />\n- In general, the project is inspired by games from the 90s, that era of early 3D on the PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-16T19:52:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c01/c0158a382bc1f7668e3c35985b52a32d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 355, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sergey Bobrov"], "esrb_rating": null}
