Don't let them get too close!<br/><br/><strong>How to play?<br/></strong>Easy! Just rotate your mouse around and press the left mouse button.<br/>You can change a bit the angle of the barrel by moving the mouse further from and closer to the tower.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Is it finished?<br/></strong>I don't think so! Right now it's a minimal playable game, but in the future I'd like to add other weapons and enemy types, other levels (of course!), and some \"pickups\".<br/><br/><strong>Is it going to be Windows only?<br/></strong>No, I'm definitely making an Android build in the near future.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T06:47:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/713/713ed52045544855bc2639d2ff74316b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Veniamin Vigovsky"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
