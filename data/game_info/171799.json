{"id": 171799, "slug": "baby-escape", "name": "Baby Escape", "name_original": "Baby Escape", "description": "<p>Baby Escape is a simple text based adventure surrounding a sassy toddler and their attempt to escape an endless daycare. The narrator for the game is the toddler the player plays as, so the descriptions tend to be rather unintelligent. </p><p>I made this game with the unity state machine. Each and every state was hand made and thought out before hand- which was relatively simple, but very tedious after a long period of time. So creating a wide spread story with multiple endings and levels prove to be rather difficult. This is my first game and this is where I learned how to manipulate text and import images. Making the text change and importing a spite were very easy and was some of the few things I got right away.   I got the sound for the background from a website for kids music. I had to speed up the tempo with audacity to make the tune sound upbeat. I learned in this project how to create a text based game, how to input sound and images into a game.</p><p>What I have learned:<br/></p><ul><li>How to use finite state machine</li><li>How to initiate text change</li><li>Add sprites into the game scene</li><li>How to add background music</li></ul><p>After finishing the game, I've found that text based games are rather sparse due to their overbearing need for special attention to detail. Though I enjoyed making the game, I don't see myself making anymore text based games for enjoyment.  When searching for assets such as sounds and images, I suggest that if possible, just make it yourself. Searching for an asset is much harder than making the perfect one.  <br/></p><p> <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fd7/fd7c012d4f9a8656de187a4871feac8d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cinn_Senpai"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
