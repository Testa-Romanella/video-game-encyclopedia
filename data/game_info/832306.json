Fight your opponent, but make sure not to kill them while still having a dramatic duel.</p>\n<p>Local co-op, but keyboard configuration is best with parsec</p>\n<p>Act out the first scene of the award winning play <em>To Be a Kiwi</em>! A kiwi bird and a kiwi fruit duel for their name, and the honor of being the one true kiwi.The director couldn\u2019t afford prop swords, so be careful not to hurt your fellow actor, while still making an engaging fight.If the fight is boring, the crowd will be disappointed and get mad. Be sure to create an exciting fight, and take control of the stage to get the upper hand on your opponent!\r\n</p>\n<p>Note - there are unfortunately a lot of bugs still in the game so you might have to use alt-f4 to exit the game, and you might not be able to win the game even when the music ends. If the music ends and the excitement bar is above halfway + both players are alive, then you have won</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-08T09:41:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d11/d11168d27f3adb73ab86e926334239f8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Lanzalot"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
