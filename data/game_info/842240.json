Welcome to the strage and somewhat chaotic world of 'Bone To Pick', an adventure/story based game that is sure to at least get one laught outta ya. That is the goal at least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game consists of a small story line in which you will play as various characters. The main goal is to kill as many of the waves of enemies you can and to enjoy the ride as you go along.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meet the crew:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Spare Ribs the Goblin\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Bill Eye the flying Eye\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022 Fun Guy the Fungi\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>And last but not least, the dead man, the legend themself:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Nicholas Ribcage</p>\n<p>You will be narrated by Mr. Ribcage and play as all of these 3\u00a0 henchmen through out the game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is our first project as a duo and the first jam for us both.<br/>This is purely a project of love and joy.<br/>We hope you enjoy playing the game and the puns! Can you figure all of the puns out? Let us know down in the comments!</p>\n<p>Being newcommers, we of course needed the help of some external creators to make this game look the way that it did.
