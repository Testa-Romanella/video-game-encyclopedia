The game is inspired by dozens of inputs contributed by many  enthusiastic individuals about snail lore. It transpires in a secluded  town, home of snail people\u2014Shelltown. \u00a0Follow our heroine in a journey of self-discovery as she learns what it truly means to be a snail. \r\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p> <br/></p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>What if a snail can\u2019t accept herself for who she is?  \u00a0Ms. Escargot believes that she will be happier joining the humans, and  so she enrolls for a prestigious human university. She gets accepted,  which gives her more reason to leave Shelltown.\u00a0Her quest to break out of her shell begins.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, things don\u2019t pan out as smoothly as she thought they  would. She meets many potential love interests as she learns more about  herself and her past. Mysteries are unraveled, and they make her  question what it truly means to be a snail person.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Is Shelltown really as peaceful as it seems?\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>Who will Ms. Escargot fall in love with?\r\n </p>\n<p>And will she get to touch the snailor's barnacles?\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0Your choices will determine what answers are discovered and if our main character gets the happy ending she deserves.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Snail Story: Love Edition, will contain over 15+ cinematic graphics (CGs) , with the option of adding more depending on our budget.\u00a0\r\n </p>\n<p>The game currently has two routes with over 100K words, each of them  containing a full story-arc that is book-length with multiple good and  bad endings. If the scope of our project is allowed to expand, we're  considering adding more arcs with different characters to enrich the  Snail Story world.\r\n </p>\n<p>Examples of our CGs:\u00a0<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<p>CHOICES MATTER in the game. They affect the outcome of the game based on two systems: a fork and a point-based system.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Some choices will lead to completely different outcomes. They relate  closely to crucial moments in the main character's journey. Choose  carefully.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0Say the right things to enamor your love interests! If they like your responses, a heart will appear.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0As a bonus, snaillies (that's what Shellfolk call snails) will be  found hiding in the backgrounds. The first one is a giveaway.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Will you be able to find them all?\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Preview of the snailly tank where your snaillies will appear.\u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T05:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80b/80bd11e265846c9e8b33fcc1f62557b4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["SquishPotato"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
