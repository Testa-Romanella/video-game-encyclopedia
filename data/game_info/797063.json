In a miraculous turn of events, the med bay sustained only minor damage, allowing the ship AI, Mina, to bring you back to life with the patented Plutronic Industries Cloning Pod\u2122.</p>\n<p>The air outside the med bay kills you. The temperature will kill you. Radioactivity will kill you. You will die. But don't be afraid, because Mina will clone you as many times as necessary.</p>\n<p>Repair the critical systems to ensure that you survive long enough for rescue to arrive.</p>\n<p>This is our entry to the\u00a0<strong>2022 GameDev.TV Game Jam</strong>\u00a0with its theme \"Death is only the beginning\", which was created in 10 days by 8 people (on/off).</p>\n<p>The files are available for eligibility validation and educational purposes. This project is NOT to be used for monetary gain in any way.</p>\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n<p><strong>The project is still in its very early stages. So far, we have the first obstacle and its immediate solution implemented.\u00a0</strong><strong>The core gameplay mechanic (which is dying and using your corpse for stuff)\u00a0is not yet done.\u00a0</strong><strong>Basically, you can walk around, jump, interact with doors, regenerate inside the medbay, die and respawn.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For the people who care:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>We used mostly our own assets for this project, which is also where a lot of our time went into. That and fighting against the Lighting Gods (we still have some flickering...). We also have made some gamemechanics, which never made it into the game, because it was story wise not yet time to be introduced. For example, a dialogue system, a grab/pull object mechanic, an inventory system where you can pick up items and store them and a crafting system. There is a playground scene available through the Source Code where you can try these things out.</strong></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>WASD</strong> - Movement</p>\n<p><strong>Mouse</strong> - Aim</p>\n<p><strong>Space</strong> - Jump</p>\n<p><strong>Shift</strong> - Sprint</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> - Interact</p>\r\nKnown Issues / Bugs\r\n<ul>\n<li>Camera clipping vertically into walls</li>\n<li>Light flickering in wrong places</li><li>When closing the door to medbay and dying shortly after, the health, oxygen and temperature bars are still draining even though the door is closed.</li></ul>\r\nFixed Bugs\r\n<ul><li>Lagging / stuttering when rotating camera</li></ul>\r\nPlanned features not completed, yet\r\n<ul>\n<li>Leave behind corpse on death</li><li>Use corpses from earlier clones to reach areas</li>\n<li>Pull corpses (completed but not added to core game)</li>\n<li>Use corpses for crafting (bone weapons)</li>\n<li>Recycle corpses to bio matter, used as a fuel for more clones (revives)</li>\n<li>Events / trigger to continue\u00a0story / voice lines</li>\n</ul>\r\nThe team\r\n<p>greggaede<br/>anserrs<br/>DehakaPrime<br/>Darkfirefox<br/>Jzagorac<br/>Meakashic<br/>patrizzle<br/>Cn4k12</p>\r\nAttribution / used Assets\r\n<p>Models:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nName\r\nSource\r\n\r\nPlayer Character\r\nhttps://quaternius.com/packs/ultimatemodularcharacters.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fonts:</p>\r\nNameSourceOxygen Mono Fonthttps://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/oxygen-mono\r\n<p>Sound:</p>\r\nNameSourceChangedStorm windhttps://freesound.org/people/juskiddink/sounds/136287/<br/>NoErrorhttps://freesound.org/people/Autistic%20Lucario/sounds/142608/NoSCI_FI_DOORhttps://freesound.org/people/alexo400/sounds/543404/CutLarge hydraulic doorhttps://freesound.org/people/nooly/sounds/331357/CutAI voice lines\u00a0https://readloud.net/NoDyinghttps://freesound.org/people/TheLittleCrow/sounds/456973/Cut\r\n<p>Images:</p>\r\nNameSourcewuste-trocken-felsen-konzept\u00a0https://www.pexels.com/de-de/foto/wuste-trocken-felsen-konzept-8474500/", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-03T17:44:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/54f/54f66ee31067825017615d49588a0c6a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Greg", "Jzagorac", "Meakashic", "DehakaPrime", "anserrs", "Darkfirefox", "Cn4k12"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
