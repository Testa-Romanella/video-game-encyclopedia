In this lab there are a lot of scientists that try to catch him and put him back into the flask it came from. Bob tried to do everything he could to not get captured by the scientists, having to go to extreme lengths to stay safe. Its most recent ability is to upgrade DNA structure and develop skills that no other blob has ever seen.<br/>Some art was taken and then modified from here: https://opengameart.org/content/scientist-0 source code: https://github.com/bydariogamer/evolutionist<br/>Created b: </p>\n<p>Emc235#2196 &amp; bydariogamer#7949<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-03T03:48:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d2/5d22d60b3a1cba8645e1501861f07f92.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Emc2356"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
