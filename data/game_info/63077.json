The ship is set to make a pretty standard trade route with only a small detour to sell a special rare item. However, before long after departure, the crew wakes up to discover that many of the ship\u2019s systems have been compromised and they are lost in space, unable to establish exactly where they are and how far they\u2019ve gone off the course. Who aboard is responsible for this and why?<br/><br/>As the new guy aboard, you\u2019ll have to build trust with your crewmates and develop friendships with them, for their loyalty can be very invaluable in what you are going to face. You may even build romantic relationships with some of them!<br/><br/>The journey ahead will be a harrowing one. You will make stops in unfamiliar locations, tackle environmental hazards, and get hunted by organized gangs operating in space. Apart from your crewmates, you also have your unique talents to help you out, and you will need to decide which of those talents to specialise in if you are to get through this in one piece. Your choices will affect how your teammates feel about you, how certain events will develop, and even who survives at the end!<br/><br/>Good luck, brave adventurer, and godspeed, for you will need it!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:56:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd85611521438ee3e65ec16400f74fd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 302, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Astronomic Games"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Astronomic Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
