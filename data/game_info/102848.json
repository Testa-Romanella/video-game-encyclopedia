Not the greatest movie but the concept was pretty cool.</p>\n<p>The aim of the game is to be the last person standing by voting people out forging alliances, and targeting those who you think are your biggest competitors</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes characters have love and hate stances against other character and they will also respond to how you act. This is all mixed in with a healthy amount of RNG and you get CircL.</p>\n<p>----- CONTROLS -----</p>\n<p>This game uses the mouse (left click only) to perform all actions. There are three ways to interact with the game:</p>\n<p>- Vote:</p>\n<p>Add to someone else's vote poll. You get one vote to spend each round (30 seconds). Keep in mind your vote is moveable until the last second.</p>\n<p>- Action: Ally:</p>\n<p>Attempt to form an alliance with another character. While allied they will not vote for you and\u00a0are likely to also copy your votes.</p>\n<p>- Action: Target:</p>\n<p>Attempt to get everyone to vote for someone in particular. Keep in mind this can backfire if who you picked is more liked than you are!</p>\n<p>Each round you get 1 vote and can take 1 action.</p>\n<p>Have fun playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b0e/b0e8101dd0ceaea2e3e1805335787009.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Achebit"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
