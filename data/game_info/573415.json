Do you accept their offer?</p>\n<p>Cauldron is a game about the instability of appearances. What we think we know about the world can change in an instant. Can we ever obtain The Truth? Or are there only truths, contingent and flowing? And what's up with that banana that keeps popping up everywhere?\u00a0</p>\n<p>These questions and more certainly won't be<em> answered </em>(what, did you think we were gonna solve the problem of Knowledge or something?), but explored in the region of Drylan -- a country with an oppressive King who punishes magic, cows that speak human Moos, conniving rats who <strong>never</strong> fear going under the table <em>(oh ho ho</em><em>)</em>, and a trusty magic tree branch.</p>\n<p>Cauldron features an original soundtrack made by yours truly! With 38 pieces and counting, the sonic world of Cauldron is rhythmic, mysterious, and thematic.</p>\n<p>Visit other worlds in your sleep, combine foci with incantations to create new spells, and maybe even get serenaded\u00a0by a fish.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:11:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b07/b07413509f9b31ccb5722cbeb8ccee06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["aujuslia"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
