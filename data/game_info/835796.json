Refract was made in less than 3 days! I tried to keep the quality of levels a priority or quantity. In this game you and your reflection must navigate the level. Use time crystals to revert your reflection to 1 second ago thus allowing you to move around obstacles your weren't able to previously! This fits the theme Cooperate with AI because you have to cooperate with a time traveling version of the player!</p>Special Thanks To:<ul><li>Anthrax</li><li>Warhead</li><li>ChickoritaLover</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-15T10:11:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0e4/0e47526aafecb6440cf3f2e14bbdf990.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["outercloudstudio"], "genres": ["Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
