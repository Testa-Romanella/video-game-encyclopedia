I'm trapped in cycle of sadness, nostalgia and apathy. Living only in one room, spending my time procrastinating and idling... <br/><br/>Can you help me climb out of the existential hell and get ready to jam? <br/><br/>Only visual reference to my state is the cell phone (at computer), otherwise my comments should give you hint how I feel. If you manage to cheer me up I can either leave the room and hopefully my depression, or I can enter LD37 and bask in blessings of accomplishment. <br/><br/>However, if time runs out (only 7 days) or I get too depressed, you join me as an epic fail (thaks for nothing!) <br/><br/>Hint: I'm a fatso, so food is probably your best first move... <br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Art: Me <br/><br/>Programming (ha!): Me <br/><br/>Music: <br/>\"Ranko's Sad\" by Richard Evans (rb-evans.com) <br/>&amp; <br/>\"Trippy happy beach\" by Dalibor Bekerevic</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2fd/2fd9ecaacb508b8c589e7961a8dd855b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["tigerrenko"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
