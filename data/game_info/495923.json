I was inspired by several of my colleague's projects last week that dealt with foreign languages and information asymmetry. I took those concepts and implemented them into this short puzzle game. Each tile that can be placed to allow the fire to reach the firework from the starting fuse is dictated by <em>seemingly </em>opaque rules. Players are encouraged to investigate, observe, and attempt to decipher the rules by which each tile is bound. Only then can you really solve the puzzles and watch the fireworks show!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T03:18:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9aa/9aacd6ac02159269a9fb81c08f17c03f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["zeeodd"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
