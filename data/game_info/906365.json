The year is 2100, and you\u2019ve been in Cryo-sleep for the past 77 years. Turns out all that holiday food put you in a bit more than just a food coma. Anyways, our goal here is to harvest asteroids from the belt and fling them to the various planets in our Solar System. Now, to ensure you get paid fairly, or paid at all, we keep a close eye on your score. You earn points by delivering the asteroids to the planets, but be careful the asteroids must collide with the right speed. Too fast you lose points and well that might end up killing some civilians.. Which would frankly just be bad for business.\u00a0 Alright, good luck out there, now don\u2019t blow up any planets on your first day, cheers!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-09T09:13:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/094/0946b99ffee490b7a4be9f3127201918.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Aarimous"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
