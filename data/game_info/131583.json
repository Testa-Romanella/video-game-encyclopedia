You can move and change shape to make your way down. <br/><br/>I was originally going to make a tutorial and a real level, but it takes too much time to make real puzzles so I just extended the tutorial. I think it would be great if a game/level designer here wanted to make a real puzzle game out of this. <br/><br/>I started the game on my own and did everything, but my friend Aurelia (facebook.com/Aurelia.Drawings) came and redid my rubbish sprites (thankfully). <br/><br/>This game was made with Game Maker Studio. It is also my first game with this engine and I'm pretty happy about the result.<br/><br/>This game was designed for Android devices but everything is still playable with a mouse or keyboard on Windows.</p><p>Windows Commands : </p><p>Move : Arrows or WASD/ZQSD  (hi frenchies !)</p><p>Rotate : Space Bar</p><p>Switch Shapes : &amp;/\u00e9/\"/' or 1/2/3/4</p><p>Enjoy !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e12/e1272699d7293fc243c0c9eeac912475.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android"], "developers": ["Garazbolg"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
