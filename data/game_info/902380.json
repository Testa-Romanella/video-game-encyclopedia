The soil under your fingers is cold; the air is dry and hot. You stand up and lean against the rocky walls of the cave. The only light source is a bonfire at its center. The cinders are black, and only a few flickers keep the charred logs burning. A pair of figures painted on the bare rock glimmer in the darkness, a woman and a weird serpentine figure...</em></p>\n<p>You Nameless Scum is the first gamebook, a.k.a. choose-your-own-path book, for\u00a0M\u00f6rk Borg. It will let you play a quick and brutal adventure for one and, in the process, create characters fully ready to use in your M\u00f6rk Borg games... at least if you make the right choices and survive. You Nameless Scum is a\u00a0100% autonomous\u00a0game and can be played without\u00a0the M\u00f6rk Borg core rulebook. That said, it's also 100% compatible with it, and\u00a0you'll be able to play the adventure with any official or third-party class\u00a0in your possession.\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>243 paragraphs of adventure\r\n</li><li>A fully interactive PDF\r\n</li><li>Creates a character for your M\u00f6rk Borg games with this adventure as their backstory\r\n</li><li>5 different finales split between two main branching paths\r\n</li><li>High replayability\r\n</li><li>Defiled by the art of Droned Artwork\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n<em>Dr(o)ned Artworks created artwork for the cover, page 1, and paragraphs 58, 86, &amp; 161, which is licensed to Rinaldo Agostini for exclusive use.
