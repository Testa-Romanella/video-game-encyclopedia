These goofy eyeballs bounce into near-perfect physics perfection.\" - Kotaku<br/><br/>\u200e\"Gluddle made me laugh. Several times. Out loud. (...) It\u2019s a puzzle, a physics game, and there\u2019s a lot to figure out, and the thing is, you can\u2019t lose, and it makes you laugh. It is fun. Major Fun. It will make you laugh. It will keep you playing. It will make you laugh some more.\" - Majorfun.com<br/><br/>\"Gluddle, which is one of the most addictive physics-based iOS games I\u2019ve come across, has just been bumped to version 2.0. In its initial state, Gluddle is already a fantastic physics puzzler. But now, in its updated version, the game is even more so.\" - AppAdvice<br/><br/>\"Gluddle is a fantastic, creative game that doesn\u2019t just copy the mechanics of other puzzle titles, it takes them, mashes them together, and pushes them farther than they have been previously, and has had some great support through updates from the developers. For that, it\u2019s definitely worth checking out.\" - TheAppShack<br/><br/>\"Lots of physics-based knock out games will really raise your blood pressure (Angry Birds and Cut the Rope are notorious for this).  For some reason, Gluddle doesn\u2019t do this.  It\u2019s mellow.\" - BestKidsApps<br/><br/>\"It\u2019s like throwing a bouncy ball very hard indoors and seeing what it smashes. Fun, in other words.\" - Games Asylum<br/><br/>\"Wa-Wa-wow! This game is absolutely immense!\" - WeDoCode<br/><br/>\"When George Orwell sat down to write dark dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, he couldn't have known that he would one day inspire Gluddle, a physics-based iOS puzzler where you dislodge spying Big Brother-style eyes in the sky.\" - Eurogamer App of the Day<br/><br/>\"Gluddle is a solid title. This hidden gem is packed with amusing gameplay, impressive music and colorful graphics that make it one of the top physics-puzzler games in my book.\" - AppsOnTap<br/><br/>\"That game is confusing, obscure, weird and has a soundtrack that is almost annoying. Played the demo for a couple of minutes, fell in love with it and bought the full version. Great job, and great game!\" - ZombieGorilla", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T14:29:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/816/816623f5ece3dbe009d1374e2cc4fd9a_SGnYpHU.jpeg", "website": "http://gluddle.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 60, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Creative Heroes"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Richard Van tol"], "esrb_rating": null}
