Give it mature themes, a fantasy setting, and female characters who are primarily strong women. Add insightful dialogue, a striking visual style, existentialism, and plenty of chances to die.</p>\n<p>The result is <strong><em>Humanitas.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Humanitas\u00a0</em></strong>is an unconventional visual novel in which \"you\" are the main character. You are a woman forced to flee your humble village due to the invasion of the Brotherhood of Retribution, a violent group taking over your world in the name of their god. With the help of friends you meet along the way, you find that it is up to you to save your world. But the truth behind these dark times is deeper and more menacing than you'd imagined. The only way to prevail is to face the truth about your world, about yourself, and about humanity.</p>\n<p>Will you succeed? Will you die trying? In the end, can your world truly be saved?</p>\n\n<p>Featuring three endings, more deaths, and about four hours of gameplay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content Warning</strong>: Contains mature themes and dark subject matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:\u00a0<strong><em>Humanitas</em></strong> may be flagged by anti-virus software.
