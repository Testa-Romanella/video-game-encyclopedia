How fast can you roll?</p><p>This is the 2016 version of Marble Incline, created in Construct 2 with assets made in PyxelEdit!</p><p>The original version was created as a part of <strong>LOWREZJAM 2014</strong>, in Stencyl. </p><p>It was the first real original game I got to work on after my MLP fangame (Perilous Platforms), plus it was the first time I actually took part in a game jam.<br/></p><p><em>If you really want to learn more about the original, check out its entry on my portfolio.</em></p><p>Why a Redux version? Many reasons!</p><ul><li>Making it in Stencyl was very challenging, and I didn't make as much content as I initially set out to make.</li><li>MI-Redux was a thought I had back in 2014, since I wanted to really expand on the project since I felt the original was much too small.</li><li>I was VERY short on time, and I had old assets (though most of the art assets were remade in PyxelEdit), which made it a bit easier to manage.</li><li>I just had to enter this year's LOWREZJAM! It would've been a huge disservice to miss out after what the 2014 jam did for me as an aspiring developer. Plus I tweeted a bunch about it, so I felt I was beholden to folks, including the jam's organizer.</li></ul><p><strong>Controls:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>MOVE</strong> - Left and Right Arrow Keys / Gamepad D-Pad Left and Right</li><li><strong>JUMP </strong>- Up Arrow Key / X Key / Gamepad D-Pad Up / Gamepad A Button</li><li><strong>RESTART (after death) </strong>- Up Arrow Key / Gamepad B Button</li><li><strong>NEXT (reaching flag) </strong>- Up Arrow Key / Gamepad Start Button</li><li><strong>MAIN MENU (during post-level screen) </strong>- M Key</li><li><strong>ACTIVATING MENU BUTTONS</strong> - Mouse</li></ul><p>So yeah, there's keyboard and gamepad controls. I couldn't fit a lot text-wise into the game, so these are perhaps the definitive controls explanation.
