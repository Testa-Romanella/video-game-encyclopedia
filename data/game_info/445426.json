If playing with a friend, your goal is to knock your opponent out of the sky and reach the goal first!\r\nYou lose if you fall out of the sky or if your opponent gets a lead big enough to put you off-screen. The game is over when there are no animals left puffing in the sky (when all animals have either been eliminated or reached the goal). Collecting hearts\u00a0 increases your size and your buoyancy, making it easier to survive., and the power-ups grant new abilities and advantages. Not collecting enough hearts will make your creature sink faster, and make staying in the air increasingly difficult.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Player 1 / Single player:\r\nJump - E\r\n<br/>Player 2:\r\nJump - P\r\n<br/>Navigate menus with the mouse\r\n<br/><br/>Full-screen is recommended</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-18T05:56:01", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Grommit"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
