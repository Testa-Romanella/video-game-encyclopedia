So far that's pretty normal - especially within the realm of platformer games - but here's the twist: <em>the blocks have letters in them</em>! And you can find other letter blocks and add them onto the existing ones to create new platforms to jump on!<br/></p>\n<p>It's a puzzle-platformer created for\u00a0the <strong>Ludum Dare 45</strong> Game Jam within the 48 hour 'Compo' time slot. If you've also participated in Ludum Dare 45, please\u00a0rate my game after playing it!</p>\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n<p>In Trelet, your goal is to reach the flag at the end of the level\u00a0(yes, there's only one level, I didn't have enough time for more!)\u00a0You do so by placing letters onto others to create new words that act as platforms to pave your way forward.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that only real words will work, and that all neighboring letters (read top-to-bottom or left-to-right) need to form ones!</p>\n<p>Can you collect all nine Star Coins?</p>\n<p>Some <strong>hints</strong>:<br/></p><ul><li>You can enter Edit Mode mid-jump</li><li>There are a lot of short words</li><li>Long words (5+ letters)\u00a0give you extra letters</li></ul><p>Trelet's controls in Platform Mode\u00a0are pretty simple:</p>\n<strong>Move</strong><em>Arrow Keys</em> or <em>WASD</em><strong>Jump</strong><em>W</em>, <em>space</em>, or the <em>Up Arrow</em><strong>Reset</strong><em>R</em><strong>Enter Edit Mode</strong><em>Enter</em>\n\n<p>In Edit Mode you'll need some other buttons:</p>\n<strong>Place Block</strong><em>Left Click</em><strong>Change Selected Block</strong><em>Mouse wheel</em>, <em>W/S</em>, or the <em>Up</em> and <em>Down Arrows</em><strong>Enter Platform Mode</strong><em>Enter</em>\r\nAdditional Info\r\n<p><em>Trelet </em>was made using the following tools:</p>\n<ul><li>L\u00d6VE as the game's framework</li><li>LMMS and Bosca Ceoil for music</li><li>BFXR for sound effects</li><li>The Lua libraries bump.lua, classic.lua, easing.lua, and lovebird.lua</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T07:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56f/56f94886a09b9d32f48f3b3b0ad1ca04.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ovidios"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
