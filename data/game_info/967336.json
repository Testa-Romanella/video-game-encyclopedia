Points in the game are converted to gold or diamonds at the end of the game in a percentage that can be enhanced on the fifth page of the store.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the game, there are 5 difficulties, each corresponding to 10 levels, including 9 general levels and an endless mode level (the statistics of the corresponding levels of each difficulty are counted together, that is, to complete the level 3 of difficulty 2 or pass the level 3 of difficulty 3 in the statistics and achievements of level 3 will be increased by 1), and the completion of achievements can get gold or diamond rewards, each pass The last level can open the lower level, complete the endless mode of the current difficulty (stick to 5 minutes or more) to open the next difficulty, the game seems to have only 10 levels, but in fact, the unlock of each difficulty level is unlocked independently (that is, the level 5 of difficulty 1 to unlock the level 6 of difficulty 1, the level 3 of difficulty 2 to unlock the level 4 of difficulty 2), so the level of the game There are 50 levels, the difference is the size and number of blocks, the higher the difficulty, the higher the number of blocks, the more life and number of blocks.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the store, the first page is to open some features in the game, the second to the fourth page is to enhance some features (including the attack power of the ball, the attack power of the missile (the missile needs to be unlocked in the first page), and the fifth page is about the statistical score and the enhancement of obtaining gold diamonds, which can be purchased in the store with the game gold, and you can get some rewards for completing achievements Most of the enhancement can be upgraded or downgraded, but the last enhancement on the fifth page is the refund ratio when the enhancement is downgraded, the initial is 20%, the full level is 100%, before this enhancement to the full level do not easily downgrade, otherwise you will lose a lot of gold coins or diamonds, so when upgrading the content, please carefully choose the previous enhancement, this is very important, but if the enhancement is lost Failure, you can clear all data in the Settings, restoring the game to its original state.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe cost of fortification in the store increases exponentially, so the higher the level of fortification, the higher the cost is very high. Through the strengthening of the fifth page of the store, the number of gold coins and diamonds can be greatly increased. After my own test, the acquisition of gold coins after strengthening may obtain tens of millions of dollars, and there are hundreds of thousands of diamonds, so the strengthening of the fifth page of the store is very key.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are a large number of dropped fruits in the game, which can obtain various buffing effects, including but not limited to piercing, second kill, missiles, etc. Most of these fruits can be fortified in the store, including but not limited to the probability of producing the fruit and the type of fruit,", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-10-06T04:02:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/185/185fa74a3292806271e121c9d6284e21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["WangYue Studio"], "genres": ["Casual"], "publishers": ["WangYue Studio"], "esrb_rating": null}
