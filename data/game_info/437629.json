On its inside drive, weird images, and a text file with instructions. \u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Subject's test has begun. Meet me at the top of the Obelisk.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>\"Where am i?\"</em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<em> \"How did i came into existence?\"</em> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<em> \"For what purpose?\"</em> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <em>\"By the hands of whom?\" </em><br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Isolated in a hidden point of our universe, the Obelisk is\u00a0 a true wonder land, far from the 01's chains of morality and ethics. A place of true scientific progress and rebellion against the deterministic laws of nature's causality.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>There's no other way. All the answers, reasons and a way out, lies at the top. <br/></strong></p>\n\n<p>Unobelisk is a solo turn based, exploration game focused on resource management and puzzle solving. <br/></p>\n<p>With level design inspired by classic Resident Evil games and Metroidvanias, puts the player in the logic circuits of Uno, exploring an obelisk-shaped space station for a path to the top of the structure, where a way out is promised.<br/></p>\n<p>The not exactly linear progression of the game is blocked by a number of riddles, passwords, keys and the mysterious threat of the primordial ghosts, along with your own Subject brothers and even the 4 scientists themselves.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, optional puzzle solving and exploration  are rewarded with upgrade modules, that grants better ammo capacity, maximum health boost, greater evasive perfomance or stronger offensive capabilities.</p>\n<p>This is a demo, with 2 hours of gameplay in the average. The final version, meant to release at some point of <strong>May 2020</strong>, will be paid and contains an average of 10 to 15 gameplay hours. The game's release month can be postponed due to reasons unrelated to development, though i'll try my best not to.<br/><br/>While there's only one active dev behind Unobelisk,\u00a0 it uses assets, music, raw graphic materials and others from a number of people that makes their great work available with free licenses. Credits can be seen in the game's options menu.<br/><br/>Feel free to send feedback, relate bugs, or ask anything in the comments.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A p\u00e1gina do jogo no Itch.io est\u00e1 em ingl\u00eas devido ao padr\u00e3o do site, mas Unobelisk pode ser 100% jogado em portugu\u00eas do Brasil, al\u00e9m da l\u00edngua inglesa.<br/><br/>Por ser padr\u00e3o da loja, a vers\u00e3o completa do jogo vai ser vendida em d\u00f3lar, e n\u00e3o contar\u00e1 com pre\u00e7os regionais. Todos sabemos que o valor atual do d\u00f3lar \u00e9 completamente absurdo, por isso estou estudando maneiras de vender o jogo a um pre\u00e7o justo de formas alternativas, por enquanto exclusivamente para brasileiros.<br/><br/>N\u00e3o posso confirmar 100%, mas a id\u00e9ia \u00e9 lan\u00e7ar uma p\u00e1gina em portugu\u00eas independentemente, com formas de vender o jogo em R$.<br/><br/>Qualquer coisa, s\u00f3 comentar abaixo.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-01T04:27:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/407/407a9dc16eadc9610c6a4f6a4c29200b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ghostwind"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
