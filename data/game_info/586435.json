The goal of each level is to cover the target with the crate. A cursor will indicate where you can place a portal (with a plus if you can place it, and a cross if you cannot) by pressing the X button. If you have placed two portals, the next time you press X the two portals will disappear.\u00a0You can walk into one portal to appear in the other portal, if nothing is in the way. Crates can also go through portals.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to leave a comment! This is a part of a personal challenge to make a simple puzzle game every day for a week, with at least 10 levels. I'm using puzzlescript for each game.\u00a0This is game four.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:23:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/08c/08c52bd048e665d1b454c860feed1ad2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oeschmid"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
