It will run and play on Windows 11, but you will have a very poor experience due to the change in function of the Windows command prompt.</p>\n<p>WORLD OF ELROTH is a text-based medieval fantasy adventure coded in batch. This has been a huge long-term project, and frankly a game like this should not be possible in batch.</p>\n<p>Upon your first morning in Elroth, the king has assigned a bounty on the last living Greatdragon, Erik of Fire, to end the war against the dragons. Traverse through five dungeons and a variety of areas to collect all five melody stone fragments to break the seal on his castle, and defeat him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game features sound and music, written by myself! There are fully fleshed out RPG elements with four unique skills for each of the four classes, equipment and accessories, and the ability to level up.\u00a0There are five dungeons and eight side quests, and over 30 different enemies to battle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game is in a stable state, but I do have plans for many future updates including more content and things to do. There should not be any, but if\u00a0any crashes occur, please let me know what was happening in the moments prior. This is the first public release of this game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-27T09:37:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/066/06658a2ef483624a750c82071cee267a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GandalfTheWhey"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
