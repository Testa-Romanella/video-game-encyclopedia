{"id": 638365, "slug": "water-cry", "name": "Water Cry", "name_original": "Water Cry", "description": "<p>The game \"Water Cry\" is a mixture of three genres-survival, PVE and adventure.\r\n</p>\n<p>From survival, the project took classic elements, such as indicators of health, food and water, after which the player will die; the game also has a crafting system and, accordingly, inventory. For the passage of the game, in some moments you will need to craft the necessary things, without passing it is not possible.\r\n</p>\n<p>PVE is expressed by fights with Tribal units. For combat, the player has two \"tools\": a sword and a shield. With a sword, you can perform three techniques - a blow, a double blow and a block; with a shield, only one technique is performed - stunning the enemy.\r\n</p>\n<p>When creating the elements of the adventure, I relied on FarCry 3: the idea of the plot is that a group of people finds an uninhabited land, but are captured by the locals ; the main character goes alone to his goal, killing crowds of enemies in order to... And here the similarity with FarCry 3 weakens, because in the original game, the goal of gg(the main character) is to save friends. In Water Cry, the goal of gg is the banal salvation of one's own life. This is not due to the cowardice of the gg, but to the fact that there is no one left to save. At the end of the game, gg will have a final race through an abandoned city, his goal is a rescue ship, at the other end of the island.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-19T06:56:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/834/834c83852a4550616e38da4ed01a8a33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 131, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Gfp.Inc"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
