{"id": 964196, "slug": "uptown-outbreak", "name": "Uptown Outbreak", "name_original": "Uptown Outbreak", "description": "The game takes place in a cyber city called Digital Haven, where the player takes on the role of a skilled player who logs in from the real world to fight against a group of rogue AI-controlled cars, known as \"bots,\" that have taken over the Uptown area. The bots are spreading a dangerous virus throughout the city and it's the player's goal to stop the spread of the virus and take down the bots.<br/><br/>The player starts in the downtown area, where they can use the currency earned from fighting the bots in uptown to buy upgrades, such as new weapons, hacking tools, and vehicles. The player can then use these upgrades to fight more effectively against the bots in uptown and earn more currency.<br/><br/>The game loop is simple, the player will be fighting the bots in uptown, earn currency, and then use that currency to buy upgrades downtown before returning to uptown again to fight more bots. The game does not feature a backstory for the player, they are simply a skilled hacker who logs in from the real world to help the NPCs in the game.<br/><br/>The game offers exciting and fast-paced gameplay, where players use their skills and upgrades to take down the bots and save the cyber city from destruction.<h3>Features</h3>Digital Haven serves as the main setting.
