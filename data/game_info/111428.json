(Nothing will happen though, sorry for that, you can click restart if you are up for another try)</p>\n<p>MISSING FEATURES:<br/>- Enemy corperations... yes time ran out before i could even start on the whole enemy ai thing..<br/>- Stock market (allows for stealing tiles from enemy corperations, you can see why this isn't done)<br/>- Being able to select from a few cards you want to research instead of topdecking it<br/>- MENUS? where are they omg, there are none<br/>- An actual win state? wow maybe we can even add a loss state as well?</p>\n<p>I don't know why you played this or read this (maybe both thank you~), i'll try to actually maybe make a game out of this sometime? (imagine i originally intended to enter the comp with this..)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/8149d2a4eb05365717ae00c227ba84f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Ryunigia"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
