{"id": 92883, "slug": "draculas-castle-beta", "name": "Dracula's Castle (BETA)", "name_original": "Dracula's Castle (BETA)", "description": "<p>Dracula's Castle is an action horror adventure game, inspired by great games such as Castlevania, Banjo Kazooie and 40 Winks. This is a beta version of Dracula's Castle, and I'm currently developing the rest of the game right now. You might come across a few bugs here and there but I tried to make this beta as polished and bug free as possible. The full version of the game will come out in fall of 2018... Hopefully. It depends on a lot of factors. But I have a feeling it's gonna be released in 2019. It's currently in development hell due to all these random games I'm working on and releasing each month.<br/></p>\n<p>The Beta version features The Tutorial Area, Floor 1, The Basement, Floor 2, Floor 3 and Floor 4, so it'll be about an hour long, depending on how you play. Of course, the game needs more polish, better optimization, and such. That'll all be added in the full release of the game. So yeah, I hope you enjoy this new beta build of the game, and if you like it, consider donating to help support me to finish the game and make more random horror games along the way. </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Wanna support me somehow?
