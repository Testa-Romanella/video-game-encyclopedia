We are currently working on an update.<br/><br/>An everlasting story about the Hero's Sword with animated 3D battles that can be played in its entirety for free!<br/><br/>The Hero's Sword, which was used 300 years ago to defeat the Overlord, has been stolen, and demons are becoming more and more common.<br/>Rain, a member of the aristocracy, is ordered directly by the King to get the sword back, and sets off on a quest with his attendant, Viola, to find the sword.<br/><br/>They don't know, though... They don't know that their quest will become a journey through time, to places far off in the past. <br/>The binding strings of fate, and the desire to trust someone... Where will these tangled threads lead them? <br/><br/> Change characters' weapons depending on the situation! <br/>Prepare for battles with enemies by equipping characters with multiple weapons. <br/>Think about how best to use different skills for each weapon to make attacks more effective, and defeat enemies.<br/>If a weapon is not used in a battle, it collects Aura, and its attack strength increases. Use a weapon with lots of Aura at just the right time to cut down enemies!<br/><br/> Strengthen weapons more and more <br/>Collect materials, and use them to strengthen weapons and make the party more and more powerful.<br/>Weapons that are no longer needed can be dismantled, too, so you can think carefully about tactics. What weapon will you choose against each enemy?<br/><br/> Dungeons full of mysteries <br/>In the dungeon, whose form changes each time you enter, you may be able to find rare weapons, and weapons with special effects.<br/><br/>* The game can be played in its entirety without the need for in-game transactions.<br/>* The actual price might differ depending on the region.<br/>* Please contact us through the Contact button on the title screen if you discover any bugs or problems with the application.
