{"id": 119279, "slug": "trade-winds", "name": "Trade Winds", "name_original": "Trade Winds", "description": "<p>\n<strong><em>Trade Winds</em></strong> is going eventually to be an exploration/inventory management/trade game where you control a trade ship and you have to sail across an unmapped ocean to both find and trade with multiple islands. The game will feature large expanses of ocean where you can set a course and sail in any direction indefinitely while you manage your inventory so sailing isn't too much of a bore, a bustling economy, and the excitement of filling out your own map of the ocean, all in a 64x64 pixel space. I'll try to add in little encounters like pirates and mermaids so sailing the vast distances between land masses isn't too boring, but it'll feature a lot of idle time so you can click away and come back when you arrive at a destination.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tIt was developed for the \r\n\t2016 #LOWREZJAM (check out the entry page to see how it did!), and it is free to play on modern browsers. I wrote a <strong>Postmortem &amp; Future Plans post</strong>, so check that out to find out my thoughts about the game and where I plan to go from here!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tAn extra special thanks to \r\n\t<strong>Paws Menu</strong> for helping with the music and menu icons in the game! Check out the music for this game and some others they helped with on their Music from #lowrezjam 2016 album on Bandcamp. And definitely be sure to check out the rest of their music, too!!\r\n</p>CreditsMusic and Menu Icons<p>\n<strong>Paws Menu</strong><br/>\r\nTwitter: \r\n\t@thesaveroom\r\n</p>Everything Else<p>\r\n\tRobbie Antenesse, A.K.A. \r\n\t<strong>Alamantus GameDev</strong><br/>\r\nTwitter: \r\n\t@Alamantus\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/809/8096718d40cc9643b8d5feb3f6e89cd0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Alamantus GameDev"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
