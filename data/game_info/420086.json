The decreasing physical and mental abilities of senior citizens pose additional requirements to video games. That is why only few of them are suitable for fostering conversations among elderly people and their relatives, which may visit them. The goal of this bachelor thesis is to test and gain experience with\u00a0concepts not yet tested with this target audience. Future endeavours will benefit from gained insights by enabling them to create\u00a0game concepts catering towards the needs of elderly people.<br/></p>\n<p>The performed research activities of this thesis display, what navigation support techniques from architecture, signage and game design help elderly people finding their way through the virtual space of a video game to their desired destination.</p>\n<p>Senior citizens from different settlements were invited to test a video game that features aforementioned navigational support techniques. While the test persons were playing, we observed their behavior as well as\u00a0recorded it using custom made\u00a0analytics tools. This way, we were able to replay their game sessions and visualize and analise them at a later point in time.</p>\r\nResearch Documentation\r\n<p>Download the complete documentation with all research findings\u00a0here\u00a0(German).</p>\r\nBachelorthesis Presentation\r\n<p>Watch conveniently what insights we gathered (30 mins, German).

When finding such a picture, they remember stories from their life which they share in a conversation with other elderly people and/or their relatives visiting them.</p>\r\nGameplay - Video\r\n<p>How to collect images and navigate in space.</p>\n\nAnalytics Tools in Action\r\n<p>Watch how our analytics tools replay a test person's play session.
