One ball is attached to the wall and the other spins around it. When you click (Left Mouse), the balls swap and you can swing around the other. Pretty simple! Spin, turn and smash into the health units to keep you alive. If you hit a health unit with a ball, you get 3 points. If you hit it with the stick in between the balls, you get one point. How many points can you get before you run out of health? Maybe not as many as you think because the longer you are alive, the faster your health declines. Good luck!</p><p>Background Image -\u00a0https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/hand-painted-watercolor-background-with-sky-c...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-14T14:41:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cd/6cdf3eb05447b72802b3e10b4c9ec6ab.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Avi"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
