But be careful, you'll also have to prevent evil plants from taking your plants over.</p>\n<p>This game was originally made for the 2017 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge, and since then I've updated and polished it significantly. I want this game to be as deep as possible while still maintaining simple rules, and I plan to continue developing this game for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>Music by Keith Burgun.</p>\n<p>Also available on iOS and android.</p>\n<p>1.2 Changelog:<br/>-The delay before enemy plants start to grow after spawning has been significantly increased.<br/>-\"Par\" has been renamed to \"Level\".<br/>-Introduced the \"Rank\" system, which awards ranks to player who reach a certain level.<br/>-Various changes to the way level is updated each match.<br/>-Special berries (green, pink, and blue) have been replaced with \"Bags\", which you must fill up with gathered berries to activate the special effects.<br/>-The pink special effect is now more powerful.<br/>-Resized buttons to make the controls more accurate on smaller screens.<br/>-Added a new drag-based movement system, which can be selected in the options menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:24:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d72/d72bbb61bb8ed8b0076979a522eb8644.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Ethan Hoeppner"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
