Described by testers as unforgiving, brutal, and thematically on-point, the game has gone through extensive balancing to get it to a stage where it is no longer unfair, but FUNfair.<br/><br/>The game is purposefully light on story, basing itself around a battle between a lone ninja and an Evil Ninja Clan helmed by a diaper-wearing Sumo. Expect to suffer not just due to the game's difficulty, but due to seeing the boss in a giant diaper. <br/>The story effectively boils down to - <strong>See Ninja, Fight Ninja, Be Ninja.</strong><br/><br/>Flash of the Blade contains 11 fast-paced, ferocious levels, 5 deadly weapons, and 6 gruelling enemy types.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-26T09:41:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ce0/ce0dc113cb62284121b18fc850bc8bd0.jpg", "website": "https://twitter.com/DOSManGames", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 322, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DOSMan Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["DOSMan Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
