Technically this is my first completed game jam and it was nuts. Really it's not even a finished game because I ran out of time trying to put all the instructions in.. I also wanted to code a string to connect to the hook but obviously, that didn't happen. So yea this game is an amalgamation of 15 minutes of planning and then 3 straight hours of coding systems just to end up with a buggy mess. This was my first official game jam and I can safely say 3 hours is a short time bro haha....</p>\n<p><strong>Controls\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>WASD to move</p>\n<p>Space to Collect Trash</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Fish Sprites and Fishing Platform -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/fishing-game-assets-pixel-art</p>\n<p>Background music -\u00a0https://opengameart.org/content/mere-baublessailing-the-mysterious-seas</p>\n<p>2 sound effects - SFXR\u00a0</p>\n<p>Font - Gomarice no continue</p>\n<p>GUI Buttons - From open game art but it's been a while so I couldn't find it again just used my old files</p>\n<p>Can, Hook and Boot Sprites and Code - Yours truly :P</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-03T11:27:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1b/a1b238d7a17d073bb7c455df7644a3de.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Warren Miller"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
