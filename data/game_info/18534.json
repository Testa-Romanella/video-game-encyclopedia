SURVIVE TOGETHER.</strong><br/>In this non-shooting shoot 'em up, you are a single white pixel who can absorb the bodies, abilities, and weapons of every enemy pixel you collect. It's up to you to stay either a small and nimble ship, or turn large and powerful. Just remember: protect your core white pixel, because every mistake could be your last. <br/><br/><strong>INFINITE POSSIBILITIES</strong><br/>Every single enemy wave is randomized, and your size and power changes for every pixel you collect and destroy. There's never one strategy that works for very long, because every playthrough is an entirely new experience. <br/><br/><strong>SIX DIFFICULTY MODES, UNFORGETTABLE BOSSES, and CO-OP</strong><br/>Each difficulty has new enemies, weapons, and bosses! Change your strategies and push your limits in each mode. See how you match up against friends and other players in the online leaderboards. <br/><br/>Two pixels are better than one. In local co-op mode, you and a friend can both collect enemy pixels independently. When one of you dies, the other can revive you simply by touching your pixel. <br/><br/>For an unforgettable challenge, Boss Rush mode will bombard you with all the bosses you've encountered throughout the game. How many can you survive?", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2015-10-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:09:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d8/6d8a7cffa18020901f61409e09bdc94b.jpg", "website": "http://pixelgalaxygame.com/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 3, "owned": 122, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 127, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Serenity Forge"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Serenity Forge"], "esrb_rating": null}
