{"id": 365382, "slug": "the-one-we-lost", "name": "The One We Lost", "name_original": "The One We Lost", "description": "<p>\"The One We Lost\" is an otome visual novel game centered around the events leading up to a mysterious homicide. By falling in love with each of the deposed, the player begins to uncover pieces of the story through a series of recorded depositions that have been sworn into evidence. In addition to being a mystery, this game is an exploration of intersecting realities and the ways in which humans handle grief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current build is more or less a\u00a0demo. It\u00a0was thrown together in three weeks. It is still relatively incomplete and a bit buggy.\u00a0We are hoping to release a more complete version with more routes, more original music, and improved art in the near future. Please stay tuned!<br/></p>\n<p>CREDITS:</p>\n<p>Airborne_Manatee: Director, Producer, Lead writer, Lead character artist, Music composer, Background artist</p>\n<p>plasmastarfish: Lead programmer, Character artist</p>\n<p>NiAsobu: Lead background artist</p>\n<p>Empish: Programmer, Writer</p>\n\n<p>crystle56839: Writer</p>\n\n<p>Zvonimir Stojanovsky: Lead music composer</p>\n\n<p>JUST A NOTE: This game was\u00a0an experiment in collaboration... the team consisted of my (Airborne_Manatee's) family, friends, and strangers, some of whom had no experience in game development. This project became a fantastic mosaic of styles and skills, and it allowed many of us to expand beyond our specific specialty. The art, music, and writing is at times inconsistent, but this is not entirely an accident. It is simply a symptom of this kind of collaboration and is part of what made the creation of this game such a rewarding experience! On behalf of Manateam, I would like to thank everyone who downloads and plays \"The One We Lost\" for being part of this collaborative experiment :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-16T07:02:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2d4/2d46a9392b52b191b2e48b6659b0aa59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["plasmastarfish", "Airborne_Manatee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
