The author is currently working on continuing to develop updates so that the game can be completed as quickly as possible to match the release price and the time that players have to pay for it.<br/>    So if you buy it now, it's likely to disappoint you, and if you're not as hopeful as the author about a better and more complete future for the game, you really shouldn't buy it now until it's better and more complete.<br/>    If you have purchased the text when you see it, the author is very sorry for this, because it did not provide you with a full enough game experience from the start. But maybe you'd like to keep the game and wait for it to be updated. The author promises that the game will be a one-time buyout and will not split up any DLC packages for sale. The price you're seeing is the price of all the game's current and future updates. In the future, the price will be raised step by step according to the game update schedule, and all purchased players will receive all updates free of charge.                                                                    <br/>                                                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>    It's an independent game developed with an individual engine, which, jokingly, could be the most independent game in the world. As a result, the difficulty is unprecedented. At present, only 1 authors have developed independently and have taken all the work of programming art. The author is currently trying to find a few friends who are interested in continuing to develop the game to form a small team, so that faster and better follow-up development and updating work, interested and procedural art modeling and other related technology players can talk to the author in detail.<br/>                                                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Program description    As mentioned above, this is a game developed by self-developed engine. The engine is built into the game program, and the game logic itself is built through the engine's script system to establish links and build.<br/>    The program itself is a development tool. The author chose to build a game in such a complex and duplicated way that it was suspected of being a duplicate wheel. The goal was to make the game as free as possible to support the ability of players to install and customize game modules (MODs), because the author really wanted to make the game an unprecedented tour in both content and scale. Play. But the author understands that as an independent game, this has actually violated the original intention and traditional definition of independent game. And it is impossible to accomplish such a feat by the author alone, or even by the few people who formed the team. Therefore, the author makes the game support the free game module function by the way of self-research engine, so that any player can try to modify or supplement the game through the script function of the engine, or download and install the game module made by others to personalize the game, or even make a brand-new game. Game.<br/>    The author hopes that the game module function can improve the slow update of the game due to the author's personal development ability and limited time and energy, or difficult to meet different types of players. Therefore, you are welcome to play, or anyone else, through the game module features of the game production release game content of various personalized modifications and additions.<br/>    Subsequent authors will publish a detailed documentation of how to modify and make a MOD for the Game Module (MOD) function.SynopsisThis is a world of myth and magic.
