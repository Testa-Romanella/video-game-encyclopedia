Three large obstacles hinder his path, though, the other chambers before Water.</p><p>Space Jerry is a First Person Platformer game that uses a keyboard and mouse to play. The main controls are listed, but there's a collectable in each level. If you find them, click on them!</p><p>Notes<br/>I've noticed that some computers will take a while going from the intro to the main menu. If it freezes, give it some time, it'll get there.</p><p>The game is currently in development. I'm looking into a few things to add or improve, such as controller support. If you have any suggestions, feel free to leave them in a comment.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/21b/21b4299b0d180bbb9b9408818f08367f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Fireballjack"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
