It covers from January of 2013 to the present day.</p><p>It's all text, no real \"gameplay\" and all meant to hopefully be emotional as it covers what I've dealt with the past few years.</p><p>All of these events that are covered are true, with some words potentially changed due to not remembering events exactly, and some small stuff that isn't as important left out.</p><p>The game is relatively long, just in terms of how many passages it is, though overall each passage is pretty short.</p><p>If you try it out I hope you get something out of it in some way.</p><p>Edit 8/12/2015: As of now, I am opening this as my only current game open for tips/donations. 12 days ago I started hormones, and I'm opening this game up for tips/donations to potentially get money for clothes and makeup and other necessities for my transition to help me out. If you donate, I thank you very, very much.</p><p>Potential content warning of transphobia and depression<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3b9/3b9ed51db57dd8b8141de34f7a3c135d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SloaneRisette"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
