But the anxiety induced by your incoming adult life materializes in the nocturnal woods. Strange sounds are disturbing your conversation, and you\u2019ll have to identify them before you can calm down and have a peaceful night.</p>\n\n<p><em>Rustle</em> is an ambient, seated VR game with binaural sound, full voice acting (in French)\u00a0and a cel shading visual style. It is a ten minutes interactive experience, partly scripted, partly sandbox, with two different endings.\u00a0You will find yourself surrounded by large conifers, sitting in your sleeping bag, and listening to the your friend Diane's\u00a0stories. A few objects are at hand to interact with your environment and its mysteries: a flashlight,\u00a0a radio, a guitar, some sticks and a bag of marshmallows!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Subtitles:</strong> French\u00a0/ English</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Rustle</em>\u00a0is supported by HTC Vive and by\u00a0Oculus Quest 1 &amp; 2 via Oculus Link. Apart from the menu access and calibration feature, you'll only need the trigger buttons. The menu allows for a full configuration of the experience, from audio to haptics.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Rustle</em>\u00a0was crafted\u00a0in three months as a student project by:</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Alice Rameau</strong>\u00a0-\u00a0Project coordinator &amp; 2D/3D Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Foucault</strong>\u00a0- Programmer</p>\n<p><strong>Antoine Lima De Carvalho</strong>\u00a0- Game Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Minna Clair</strong>\u00a0- UX/UR Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Antonin Terrien</strong>\u00a0- Sound Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Enzo Giglio</strong>\u00a0- Sound Designer</p>\n<p><strong>Rudy Michel</strong>\u00a0- 3D Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Yann Kukolewsky</strong>\u00a0- 2D Artist</p>\n<p><strong>Ora Yermia</strong>\u00a0- Diane\u2019s voice</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T07:38:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e6/9e6cf672099bac4cad5a8f658e5a8266.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 354, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Thomas Foucault", "Ramo", "TheGalgenHumor", "Enzo Giglio", "Yelaw", "masalirow", "Xiff47"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
