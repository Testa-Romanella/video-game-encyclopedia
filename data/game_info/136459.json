Use the environment and their projectiles to determine where enemies are located.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is an experimental\u00a0multiplayer FPS I have been working on for a little over two weeks now. Let me know what you guys think. Its only random matchmaking so get a couple of people to get on at the same time and have some fun.</p>\r\nDirections:\r\n<ul><li>First one to<strong> 10</strong> points wins</li><li><strong>The environment will light up around you, giving your position away to other players</strong></li><li>There are no character models. Only small particles that can be seen by players</li><li>Grab the pickups from the glowing spawnners in order to change weapons</li></ul>\r\nControls:\r\n<ul><li>WASD or Arrow Keys to move</li><li>Space to jump</li><li>Mouse to look around</li><li>Mouse Click to fire a weapon</li><li>Esc to Pause</li></ul>\r\nNotes:\r\n<p>v1.16 - I am trying to figure out how to implement a patcher so\u00a0 we dont have to keep downloading new versions.\u00a0Its still a baby so please excuse the terrible models and textures. This prototype is mainly for testing the FEEL of the game. Please feel free to try it out</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1d/a1d2b9440ca4e903fafbcfe5c2c41705.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 77, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["GoodArcade"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
