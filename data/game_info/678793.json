Level 1's background is 1080 x 1920 while levels 3-4 were 8640 x 6480 pixels. Different randomly placed patterns of stars on each level and different color gradations and pattern. I used the app Medibang on my iPad with an apple pencil 2 to create these background PNGs,\u00a0watched several tutorials, and looked at different images of space to decide how to create these backgrounds. Adding a new brush to my Medibang toolkit: Thick Brush\u00a0(Sumi Ink), I learned how to use this specific patterned brush but created backgrounds that were too colorful and distracting so I scrapped them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) I also created 2 additional levels. I changed the positions\u00a0and added several more enemies into each level going up by 2's starting with level 1 with 4 enemies and ending at level 4 with 10 enemies to defeat to win.</p><p>4) I added an overall how to play section including controls to the user interface under instructions and changed the pause and centering of buttons to my liking.\u00a0</p><p>5)\u00a0I made an icon for my game using Medibang.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Created by Rachel Tiv.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-15T05:00:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f83/f8325052be98590d80c1d3ffa2725d4a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 42, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Rachel Tiv"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
