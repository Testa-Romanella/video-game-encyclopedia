The path to reach the Nirvana was very difficult, but Arita, Mistress of Light, wanted to reach it to unlock the ultimate power and knowledge. But the Eight Trigrams, the gods of the elements, were jealous of this, and wanted to stop her. They called Heuk, Master of Darkness, who also had secret desires to reach the Nirvana. There was a war between Arita and Heuk, and between it, the Eight Trigrams and their army attacked both. From this conflict, the world divided in two. One was for Arita, who founded the Asu, and the other for Heuk, who founded the Ora. Arita stablished her capital at the Asa Castle, while Heuk stablished it at the Hwangcheon Castle. The two factions are enemies, but they have a common enemy: the Eight Trigrams.
