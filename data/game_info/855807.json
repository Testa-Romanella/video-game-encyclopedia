In this program those buttons are the keys on your keyboard.</p>\n<p>The magnet shortly after deactivates and lets the egg drop back down.</p>\n<p>Upon landing, the egg emits a sound. This sound could be anything, but for the sake of simplicity, the sounds emitted are piano keys.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p><strong>(Controls different in browser version are in parentheses)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>W E R T</strong> - Top row of eggs</p>\n<p><strong>S D F G</strong> -\u00a0\u00a0Middle row of eggs</p>\n<p><strong>X C V B</strong> - Bottom row of eggs</p>\n<p><strong>Esc (Space) - </strong>Open menu</p>\n<p><strong>13th egg</strong><br/></p>\n<p>In order to get to the 13th egg, you must click in the middle of the screen and enter the number \"13\".
