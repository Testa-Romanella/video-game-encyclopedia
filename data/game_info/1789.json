{"id": 1789, "slug": "the-swapper", "name": "The Swapper", "name_original": "The Swapper", "description": "<p>The Swapper is a classical platform game with several elements of Metroidvania focused on solving puzzles. The game follows a female astronaut stranded on the abandoned space research station in a science-fictional universe. Completing the game players will be able to learn more about the fate of researches and to restore the sequence of events held aboard the station. Players assume the role of the protagonist, as she tries to clarify the mystery of a unique item, which allows her to clone herself and to transfer the mind to the clone. Therefore, the cloning ability is a basic game mechanic that helps the player to solve puzzles and complete levels. The gameplay features traditional side-scrolling platformers\u2019 elements: players control the 2D action from the third-person perspective. In the course of the completion, players are going to face obstacles of varying degrees of complexity ranging from simple barriers (however inaccessible for clones) to higher platforms or even gravity shutdowns.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2013-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-30T18:00:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/6fc/6fcb1c529c764700d55f3bbc1b0fbb5b.jpg", "website": "http://facepalmgames.com/the-swapper", "rating": 3.51, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 261, "owned": 3654, "beaten": 297, "toplay": 87, "dropped": 211, "playing": 18}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 50, "ratings_count": 517, "suggestions_count": 435, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 521, "platforms": ["Wii U", "Xbox One", "macOS", "PS Vita", "PC", "Linux", "PlayStation 3", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Curve Digital", "Facepalm Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": ["Curve Digital", "Facepalm Games"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
