They have created a large number of enhanced clone soldiers and sent extraterrestrial troops to collect chickens on Earth. You are a female warrior codenamed Black Blood, and you must use and strengthen your firearms to eliminate all enemies and save all chickens!<br/>\r\nThis is a FPS shooting game where enemies come in waves. After eliminating the current wave of enemies, you can purchase ammunition, upgrade your guns, armor, and more to eliminate the next wave of enemies.<br/>\r\nThe game uses physics engines, bullet time, and many parody types of enemies, such as sirens, toilet people, gun demons, superheroes emitting laser light, etc. It is a bit like the 3D version of 'Metal Slug' or the gun version of 'Blade and Sorcery', which is very exciting and interesting. The operation is very simple, you can control it using the arrow keys and mouse.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-02-09T17:38:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/947/947c6c70f7783e8fbe83ff9135fd3e0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["The Light of Science"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "RPG", "Indie"], "publishers": ["The Light of Science"], "esrb_rating": null}
