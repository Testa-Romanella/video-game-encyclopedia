The player controls a ball that will be destroyed if it touches any object that does not share its color. Collecting a colored orb will change the ball to the color of the orb. There is a different path to completion for each color, and successfully reaching the end will award the player with the corresponding medal.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T02:55:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa3/aa329553a19b37c90ac5a960568d78ee.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jakub Sawczuk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
