A new spin on the traditional side-scroller.</p>\n<p>In this twitch-action 2D side-scroller, players take on the form of a waveform as they avoid incoming obstacles. The gameplay is underscored by a \"phase-changing\" mechanic which allows rapid switching between analog and digital waveforms. In analog, movement is slower and more controlled, whereas the digital form allows for rapid traversal in straight lines. The dichotomy between these two forms of play gives rise to a delicate balance between the composed and the frenetic that lends itself to an addictive feedback loop.</p>\n<p><em>The Speed of Sound </em>was made during the MEGA 24-hour Newbies and Vets Jam, based off the theme of \"waves\".\u00a0This also happens to be the first game project I worked on!</p>\n<p>I acted in the capacity of designer and programmer on this project.\u00a0<em>The Speed of Sound</em>\u00a0was developed in Unity and programmed in C#.</p>\n<p>Developed by: AB Biswas, Emma Bobell, M.
