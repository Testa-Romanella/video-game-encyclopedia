Still pretty happy with how it came out and I feel like I've gotten a bit better at using it again. One step closer to\u00a0 being ready to try the big main project I have in mind sometime in the future. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-02T13:12:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dae/dae5cc8a7e396e37599b1b662c896acc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dragonien"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
