Awesome we're half way there!</p>\n<p>How about FlingSmash!?! No???\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well I have and it lead me to dream up this dumb little crossover lol. I hope you can find fun in it :)<br/><br/>I made all of the smash character pixelart for this :0 It took a bunch of work but I'm mostly happy with\u00a0them. You can download individual sprites from my Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/outerrim<br/>or them all at once from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cCwIfBDyjbsVLhWdwEei_F2khYcUT39Q<br/><br/>I also did all the code!!! It was made in LibGDX which is a super cool game framework you should try out if you haven't already :)<br/>My code can be found at this repository and will update as I remember to push to it (might not be frequent lol):\u00a0https://github.com/seanlindell/FSS<br/><br/>Everything else is blatantly stolen!!! I'll at least give credit though!<br/><br/>Music is from here:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>SFX are from here (rip from SSBU):\u00a0https://www.sounds-resource.com/nintendo_switch/supersmashbrosultimate/<br/><br/>and the hand/bullet sprites are from here (rip from Kirby and the Amazing Mirror):\u00a0https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/kirbyandtheamazingmirror/shee...<br/><br/>I also did not make super smash brothers or any of the characters in it (I wish I did though that would be super cool :) )<br/><br/>I'll also plug my website where you can use the sprites to generate smash tournament results graphics :0 :0 :0 :\u00a0https://www.smashpixelresults.com/<br/><br/>If you wanna use anything I\u00a0made here for anything feel free! Just please lmk since I'd love to see what you make :)<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-31T19:57:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b4c/b4c7b7505a92895719bfd72503dcd8dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Outerim"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
