Explore the once lively island while skillfully weaving your way through waves of relentless holographic enemies, all while swiftly loosing arrows toward your targets. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHolopoint: Chronicle is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. There are multiple areas to explore, each offering original targets and waves to progress through. Progression quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will complete the last wave.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE.  REMEMBER TO BREATH AND TAKE BREAKS.<br/>\r\nWARNING: This game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
