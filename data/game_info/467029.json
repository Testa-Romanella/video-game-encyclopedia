Passengers need to get around Velo City, and it's your job to pick them and and get them to their destination. The catch? Your car's out of control and there's no brakes. It also gets faster with each passenger you deliver. What's worse is the fact that your boss put you on a strict deadline, so be quick!</p><p>Note: I didn't start this project until almost a whole day had passed for the jam, so most of this game is a 12 hour day's worth of work. I worked on this project alone, and only specialize in programming and audio.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:58:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa5/fa5ce86bccb28765f2368e5a54245a7f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Matthew Hein"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
