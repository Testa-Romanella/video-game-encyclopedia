You must find your sweetheart, and deliver your love to her! Or will you succumb to the fear of rejection?</strong></p>\n<p>Developer's note:</p>\n<p>This took me almost the span of the game jam to make. I tried multiple combos of colours for the characters to get a unique combination. My biggest struggle was getting the main mechanic, the 'light circle' (the space in which you can see), to work. I tried multiple techniques, and in the end I was about to give up, until I realised I could make it as part of the UI. I tried it, and it worked! There is no sound as I am not much of a sound engineer and/or musician, and do not have the software to do so (besides GarageBand on my phone, which I haven't used for this project).</p>\n<p>\u00a0Also, the levels may be a bit tricky, as I myself found the levels frustrating. It is likely that you will die on your first play, buy you must take a look around the map, and take leaps of faith to discover a way up. Oh yeah, this is a platformer that goes <strong><em>UP</em></strong>. Have fun and I hope to hear feedback!\u00a0</p><p>This game was made for Brackeys Game Jam, and the theme was 'Love is Blind'.</p>\n<p>- Caleb (LebbyFoxx)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-02-22T03:35:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/515/5153222d3278fa3d16c7d813c3442072.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LebbyFoxx"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
