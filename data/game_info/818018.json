The Backrooms are out of the boundaries of the real world and can only be accessed by no-clipping through a floor, elevator, wall, stairs, etc., in a place that inspires deja vu or an uncomfortable feeling of nostalgia. Explore the liminal spaces, survive the entities, scavenge for food, supplies, and weapons, craft items to trade, and try to survive.
