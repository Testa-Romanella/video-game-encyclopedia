The theme of the game jam was \"you are the monster\".  I decided to make a sandbox style game where you run around as a small monster and destroy tall buildings made out of blocks.  The player has no real goal.  They are just free to play around with the physics and cause as much destruction as possible.  The game was made using Unity 5.</p><p>Controls aren't the most intuitive but are as follows:</p><p>wasd keys: Player movement.</p><p>spacebar: Jump.</p><p>spacebar whilst holding o key: Super jump.  (Used to traverse great height and distance!  More affective if you run to build up momentum.)</p><p>i key: Punch.  (Knocks blocks back with a destructive right swing!!!)</p><p>u key whilst off the ground: Dive. (Fly downwards with great speed and bring pain to those below!)</p><p>y key: Centers the camera behind the player. (The camera is generally horrible.  I'm sorry.)</p><p>Additional notes:</p><p>If you fall off the edge of the map, you'll have to reset the game.  Totally forgot to reset the player. My bad.</p><p>The audio is functional but definitely not pleasant.  I'm sorry.  Collision sound was made using http://www.bfxr.net.</p><p>Here's the download link for the unity project in a zipped folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6pqe2c9M3VEYUZ1WkJ1MXRXSXc/view?usp=sharing</p><p>My code is uncommented nonsense.  I'm sorry.</p><p>Think that's everything.  Hope you enjoy knocking over cubes!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/041/04110e996fa6f1d790021c92eb4c6da8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["inquisitivegeek"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
