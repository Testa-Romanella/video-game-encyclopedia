A 50 level brick-busting bonanza with 100 screens, bonus levels and big scary bosses!</p>\n<p>As well as the well-known originals you will find completely new power-ups, including powerful cannons, a nuclear blast, and just to mess with your head a little, a power-up that makes all the bricks invisible.</p>\n<p>Not all of the bricks in Bat n Ball are what they seem. Some turn out to be alien creatures that get angry and launch themselves at you when hit by the ball. Some contain extra balls themselves to give you a helping hand. Then there are bombs to clear those bricks faster and bonus bubbles to boost your score and give you bonus lives.</p>\n<p>Screens come in different shapes and sizes. Just as you get into a rhythm of left, right, bat the ball, the screen is flipped onto it\u2019s side testing your skills to the max. No problem for you? Then let\u2019s open up the screen at the top too! Now you have two bats to control to stop that ball escaping!</p>\n<p>Can you keep a cool head when the bricks start moving down the screen at you, when teleports zap the ball from one side of the screen to the other and when floor mounted disruptors and mysterious shifting shapes suddenly change the trajectory of the ball?</p>\n<p>Survive all that without breaking a sweat and you are truly a master of Bat 'n' Ball!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T07:41:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/161/161cdc6071f0866507344580e6dcc822.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Langford Productions"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
