Create completely new and random worlds at the roll of a dice!</p>\n<p>This software\u00a0uses the diamond-square algorithm to randomly render\u00a0perlin noise into seperate seed maps of position, temperature, humidity, and elevation\u00a0that combine\u00a0together to create a completely unique procedurally generated\u00a0biome world! :D</p>\n<p>On the main menu, you can choose the size of the world (1x), (2x), (3x), &amp; (4x). I HIGHLY\u00a0recommend keeping it at the default size (1x) as\u00a0larger the land is, the\u00a0longer it takes to load.</p>\n<p>To relate to the theme, the output of a dice roll is random every single time, and so is the output of this\u00a0generation\u00a0simulation! I was able to make and polish this game as much as I could\u00a0in only a single\u00a0day!</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:\u00a0 mouse</p>\n<ul><li>Hover over any area with your mouse pointer to\u00a0check its temperature, humidity, elevation, and biome (at\u00a0the top of the screen)!</li><li>Use the scroll wheel to zoom in/out.</li><li>When zoomed in, left click and drag to move the camera around.</li><li>When you're done, right click to go back to the main menu and\u00a0generate a new world!</li></ul>\n<p>If you discover any cool or wacky worlds then feel free to screenshot them and tweet with\u00a0#terraintoolbox :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T07:23:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ecc/ecc041446d3014f6dd4a96d94a2b9d67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MkMuffi"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
