Game is extremely short, however; every single choice in the game has sketches to go with it, so I highly recommend playing it multiple times to see what happens for the other choices!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/920/9204001c4d6535f68ce0582bdd790579.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["ciderwrath"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
