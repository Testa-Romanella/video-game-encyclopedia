Gear - Press and hold d-pad on HMD to move. (Is a little janky sometimes.)</p><p>Obelisk is an interactive narrative experience. In terms of the theme, a character's shape has been changed. In addition to that, there is a scene with shapes that are dynamically shifting in response to the viewer's movement.</p><p>We hope you enjoy experiencing it as much as we enjoyed making it. Thank you to the wonderful hosts of the game jam, to Sketchfab, Unity, especially the wonderful community with their helpful answers and prefabs. :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/434/43482d6614f458386784f5f6d0659451.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["veronicats"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
