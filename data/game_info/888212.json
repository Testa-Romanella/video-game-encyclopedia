However, things happened so that you're crashlanded onto the unknown planet, so that you have to repair the spaceship's thruster to escape this place after you recovered that item... Or choose not to recover if you want.</p>\n<p>Note: I didn't had enough time to polish many aspects of the game, such as crafting mechanism, even though 30 days are here to use to develop my game and still ended up rushing the development because of several times of procrastination and me being intern difficult to spare some time.</p>\n<p>Some known issues: Placing block(s) adjacent to a block while enemy being there and closing inventory tab while have any tooltip displays over the slot inside inventory will cause crashes, as well as restart the game will not revert the inventory back to original intent.</p>\n<p>Also: I will find some time to back up the credits of the assets I have used for my game.
