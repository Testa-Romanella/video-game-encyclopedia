Explore the new world by overcoming obstacles between two planetary bases. Moving through various abysses, volcanoes, lava or acid streams, transforming your space rover. <strong>Use tracks to move on aggressive surfaces, ion engines to fly across abysses and big wheels to move on hard surfaces</strong>. Choose the optimal driving mode, because the energy consumption in all modes is different. And don't forget that the rover only charges when the solar panel is open.</p>\n<p><strong>Space Rover</strong> is a Sci-fi 2D Side-Scrolling Runner space game with the original design, atmospheric music, and easy control.</p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf0d \u21e8\ud83d\ude80\u21e8\ud83c\udf12\u21e8\ud83d\ude80\u21e8\ud83c\udf10\u21e8\ud83d\ude80\u21e8?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-06T03:39:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7a5/7a5cd31f256be010622dad50376be55b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 197, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Pcfaktor"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
