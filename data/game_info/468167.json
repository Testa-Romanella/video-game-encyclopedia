To get out of the spiders control, the small boy must set the nest on fire, and escape before the fire catches up to him.</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is all about speed and time. Your final score is ultimately determined by the time spent in actual gameplay. The faster you beat the game, the higher you score!\u00a0You have 5 lives, spend them wisely or\u00a0it's gameover.<br/></p>\n\r\nHow the heck do you play this game?\r\n<p>Glad you asked. The goal of the game is to finish the game in the fastest possible way. The game does not provide any tutorial, as part of the game is to discover every single little trick of the game yourself, and improve by it, to get even shorter playthroughs (and higher scores).</p>\n\r\nThe controllers of the game are very simple!\r\n<p>Arrow keys/WASD - Move</p>\n<p>Z/Space - Jump</p>\n<p>You may also use a gamepad (tested with Xbox One controller).</p>\n\r\nI'm still stuck!\r\n<p>This game is not about handholding, however if you're really stuck at the beginning of the game, then here are a few tips that you might appreciate;</p>\n<ol><li>You can jump off walls by turning the other way and pressing the jump button. This requires some practice to get the timing right.</li><li>The spiders can be killed by jumping when you are just above them. If you let them get too close, you die.</li><li>You can jump off of walls in the background as well, you know, the dark rocks that are usually just decorative in similiar games.</li></ol>Plans for the future<p>Given the limited time during the jam, a lot of hard priorities had to be made to deliver a playable product. However, taking this project further in the future is obviously completely possible. Stuff I'm planning for the future includes;</p><ol><li>An online highscore list (needs some decent anticheat)</li><li>Better movement mechanics. Right now the physics are a bit eh.</li><li>More intricate mechanics,\u00a0 more interactable firesystem (the player might be able to ignite certain spots manually to influence the game, for example)</li><li>More enemies, more interactable environment</li><li>Maybe, maybe 1v1 multiplayer support, if demand arises.</li><li>Suggestions?</li></ol>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T19:03:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e6e/e6eab6c9790b0136f25f6f2ac634a351.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 86, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Haikatekk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
