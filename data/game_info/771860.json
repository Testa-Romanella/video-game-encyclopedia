This high intensity game has you moving through a procedurally generated maze like map and avoid the ever expanding circle which inevitably will consume EVERYTHING! However, its spreading can be controlled by purchasing upgrades that cost money that you get by hunting down coins or killing enemies. WAIT ENEMIES!!??!?!?!?? Yup, Don't Touch The Circe has got it all! When an enemy hits you, you don't die, but a new circle is created at a random place in the map. It may seem like everything is ok and going good, but with the ever increasing price of upgrades, end game can be very chaotic. Hope you enjoy :)</p>\n<p>My submission to the Ludum Dare 50 Game Jam<br/></p>\n\n<p>Also the Mac build SHOULD work, but I haven't had the chance to test it</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-18T07:57:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3ed/3edcc61a0a929f37c7bda25577a9280e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Will Hess"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
