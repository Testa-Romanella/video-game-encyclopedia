It's my first time doing a game jam and I learned a lot. This version has the benefit of a couple days of extra development, including ongoing bug fixes and balance changes. Unless any big issues are discovered, I do not plan on significantly changing the project at this point.</p>\n<p>Game Summary:\r\n</p>\n<p>You are a wizard specialising in one of four schools of magic: fire, wood, electricity, or water. Spells are represented as cards. Each card has its own element and a target element. You can theoretically play your whole hand every turn if you can chain your cards properly.\r\n</p>\n<p>Defeating monsters and finding treasure increases your power. You can take a portal to a new world, but each time you do so the strength of the enemies will increase. Your goal is to beat a boss on each elemental world, unlocking the portal to the final world and boss.</p>\n<p>Download:\r\n</p>\n<p>There are two links. \"AstralPath.zip\" is the\u00a0original game jam version.
