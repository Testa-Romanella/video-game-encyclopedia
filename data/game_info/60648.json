{"id": 60648, "slug": "host", "name": "HOST", "name_original": "HOST", "description": "Immerse yourself in an alien realm where the sights, sounds, and sensations that you experience all become clues for your survival. Touch a green glow and see its effects. Open a gateway to a new area. Experience new rooms, and descend deeper. Level by level, tap into your gaming intuition to solve each puzzle. Who or what is the \"host\" and what is your relation to this space?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith a focus on experiential-based gameplay, Garrett Fuselier has created a virtual reality to challenge and cherish. The dim glow of the swelling visuals and the fluctuation of the atmospheric audio (all created solely with voice work) build a new kind of gaming experience that, like its narrative, grows in intrigue and innovation. Recalling the classic situation-based puzzles throughout gaming history, you will find no UI, no voice over, and no buttons to press (on your controller).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nInside the world of HOST, you are your only salvation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game will stay naturally within the confines of your environment. For the best immersive experience, change your Chaperone settings to be minimal and dark.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T21:58:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ffb/ffb1ebdad6f5a55704432b6cdd98062a.jpg", "website": "http://hostvrgame.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 202, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Garrett Fuselier"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Garrett Fuselier"], "esrb_rating": null}
