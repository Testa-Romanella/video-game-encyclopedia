In Firefox, I had about half the FPS when I was lucky...</strong></p>\n\n\n<p>So! After a year of not participating in a game jam as a solodev, I couldn't resist this one.\u00a0</p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>This is a (very\u00a0 short) story of hope, failure and success.</p>\n<p>A small group of explorers set out two years ago to further their plant research in unknown territory. But unfortunately in life things don't always go as planned and after a short time contact broke off. It is now up to you to find out what happened.</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>This game is a platformer. Your goal is to reach the top of the mountain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since the climb is impossible in some places without help, you have two types of plants by your side that will support you.\u00a0The <strong>platform plant </strong>digs into the stone and is stable enough for you to stand on.\u00a0With the <strong>jumping plant</strong>, on the other hand, you can cover great heights.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there was no time left for plant 3 during the jam. I hope you will forgive me one day. .__.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>Movement - WASD</p>\n<p>Jump - Space</p>\n<p>Grab Wall - Right Mouse</p>\n<p>Plant - Left Mouse (on suitable walls)</p>\n<p>Back to Checkpoint - C</p>\n<p>Help/List of Controls - H</p>\n<p>Open Diary - I</p>\n<p>Open/Close Menu - Esc (some graphics settings)</p>\n\n<p>Hope you will have some fun!\u00a0Let me know if you made it to the top! :)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T05:57:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/561/561f28d9560a3e5a491060ad1c557e40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Knuffwolke"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
