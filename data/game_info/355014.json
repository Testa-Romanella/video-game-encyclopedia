Once you start, you won\u2019t want to stop. Try it, and see how high you can score. The goal is to group six or more balls of the same color together. Once the balls are grouped, your score increases, and the grouped balls disappear to make room for more maneuvers. After each turn, the iPhone (or iPod) puts more balls on the board and your task becomes more difficult. The game is over when the board completely fills up.<br/><br/><br/>PLEASE BUY FULL VERSION!<br/>Why to buy the full version?<br/>Full version has:<br/><br/>-- Colorblind mode. Use fruits and flowers instead of balls. Kids love this too!<br/><br/>-- Better Scoring! You are given higher score if you remove more colors at once!<br/><br/>-- Multiple background textures!<br/><br/>-- Global leaderboard!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2008-11-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T02:11:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c99/c99a359aa64b94942be9214c5e8f0234.jpg", "website": "http://www.bootant.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 43, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Bootant"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Bootant"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
