Then take some resources and put them in your fabricator.</p>\n<p>Now you should make a miner first so you can start getting resources.</p>\n<p>But resources need to be refined with a refiner before they can be used.</p>\n<p>Then you can point your refiner to your fabricator (or the ship) and you have a basic resource scheme.</p>\n<p>But beware, machines require power. You should mine some silicon and make a solar panel (or a bunch). If you run out of power you can always turn off non-essential machines.</p>\n<p>Let's not forget about the infected. They will be coming. You probably should have prepared by now.</p>\n\n\n\r\nNote:\r\n<p>This game is partly unfinished. I spent days and days running on barely any sleep since I could only really work on this at night (babies kill jams..)</p>\n<ul><li>You can only sell polymer at the moment in the <strong>Trade Terminal.<br/></strong></li><li><strong>You cannot buy a robot or a cat (SORRY)<br/></strong></li><li>Your ship is NOT SAFE (infected can kill you through it)</li><li>All items were supposed to have bullet effects (Slowing, Knockback, Stun, Bombs, Homing..)</li><li>Day night cycle was not completed because I couldn't get the lighting system to work properly</li><li>Enemies were supposed to be a lot smarter.. right now they just always chase you</li><li>Your ship and machines are supposed to have health that enemies destroy</li><li>Your metafab inventory is supposed to cross over all saves</li><li>Batteries don't work</li><li>I thought basic multiplayer would have been cool..</li><li>The ship clock does not work.
