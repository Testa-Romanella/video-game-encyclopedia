The PuPu Adventure Park is meant to be an unforgettable adventure for the heroes, while the PuPu clan works hard to build park facilities to satisfy park visitors!<br/><br/><strong><h3>As the PuPu clan and Park leader, you'll have full control of the Park operations, the employees (other PuPus) and the facilities: </h3></strong><br/><br/>Staffing and assigning the most \"capable\" PuPu to run newly-built facilities. The more you make your customers (\"heroes\") SWEAT from activities, the more you gain as resources to continue running and expanding the Park. <br/> <br/><br/><br/>Design your park by catering to the customers (\"heroes\"); the Park's offerings will be listed on a mission board where different customers (\"heroes\") will come for different demands. Make sure you build a wide range of missions to get the most out of them - including rare items and hero elements, used to upgrade your Park!<br/> <br/><br/><br/>From special facilities like the Weapons Shop, the Groceries and the Tailor's, to special customers (\"heroes\") like poets, merchants and even bounty hunters...make sure you keep unlocking facilities from the Blueprint to expand the Park. You might also stumble upon some surprising stories in this Park...<br/> <br/><br/><br/>With the expansion of the Park, you will need more \"employees\"! You will be able to breed more PuPu through the Spring of Life. Grow them and feed them through building houses, cookie machines, and bakeries etc. (Yep, they have a sweet tooth!), you will also have to soothe their mood sometimes. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't forget why you're here - ultimately you want to revive the God of PuPu clan so that it brings back the mysterious power of the Spring of Life...the source of PuPu's well-being. But first... You'll need to slave the days away by running your lease from Goblin's Park and survive. <br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-21T05:02:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/324/324f8ee26ab8ee77c3c042c50aa71252.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u897f\u6885\u6811\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u897f\u6885\u6811\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"], "esrb_rating": null}
