Ultimate Arena puts you in charge of the greatest battle royale, the one that you pick who fights and the conditions they fight under. Take charge by setting up landmines, deploying care packages, and initiating arena events.<br/><br/>Create characters, all the little sayings they make, the battle cries, the final speeches, or perhaps create new events like rabid kittens that fall from the sky, a poisonous fog that eats humans alive, or maybe a rogue robot that feeds on living flesh! Your imagination and the limited amount of space left on your SSD are the limit! Share your characters and events with friends on the Steam Workshop and soon you'll have a collection of billions upon billions of unique experiences inside the Ultimate Arena.<br/><br/>Like tinkering with code? We've open sourced Ultimate Arena, now anyone can request features or even write them into the game yourself! As time goes on more and more features will be added to make the world's most advanced arena simulator even better!<br/><br/>Ultimate Arena left Early Access in August of 2016 and has had 2 major updates since. The latest is \"Staycation Nation\", a tribute to all of the Americans staying at home during the summer and cracking open a cold one with the boys. It's your job to create the most exciting Staycation or die trying.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-08-23T13:01:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/464/4643beea117f6ae059614f8a580f85ba.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 2.19, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 10, "owned": 319, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 6}, "playtime": 4, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 21, "suggestions_count": 421, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 21, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Triverske", "Gianmarco Rocco", "Kenneth Caselli"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Triverske", "AceGamer Network"], "esrb_rating": null}
