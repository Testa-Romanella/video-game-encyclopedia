It's after hours at The Cluny and you've got yourself some cheeseballs and a teaspoon - time to play Cricket Pong and try not to get too drunk!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Each mouse guards a set of shot glasses and they take it in turns to bowl. When bowling, you choose a shot glass to aim for then time the throw with a moving target over a power bar. Similarly, when batting, choose a glass to aim for and hit the sweet spot on a power bar. If cheese lands in your shot glass - drink up!\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Incredibogs!</p>\n<p>Kian - Programmer</p>\n<p>Emily - 3D Artist</p>\n<p>Vic - 3D Artist</p>\n<p>Elliot - UI Artist / Designer</p>\n\n\n<p>SFX (3rd Party Assets):</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/win-city-uptempo-cool-jazz-funk-lively-funky-drums-form-the-basis-with-funky-bass-and-jazzy-organ-riffs/<br/></p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/black-fedora-sneaky-jazz/</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/baseball-ball-hit-with-wooden-bat/</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/person-drinksslurps-from-cup-or-glass/</p>\n<p>https://www.zapsplat.com/music/7-year-old-child-short-burp-1-2/<br/></p>\n<p>Fonts (3rd Party Assets):</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/punk-kid-font.html</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/nexa-rust-font.html</p>\n<p>https://www.1001fonts.com/showboat-font.html<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-18T05:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9e/d9ee7245e19d9f8b613aa2374a013d31.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 92, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kian Bennett"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
