{"id": 201392, "slug": "these-things-in-me", "name": "These Things In Me", "name_original": "These Things In Me", "description": "<p>You play both as a person, and a city inside that person. The goal is to launch the rocket, constructed inside the persons head. To launch the rocket, you have to generate 200 technology.</p>\n\r\nControls\r\n<p>WSAD for movement of character. Hold right mouse button and move mouse to move around 'person city' view. The mouse wheel zooms. Use left mouse button to place items.</p>\n\r\nInstructions\r\n<p>(To build items, click on the 3 buttons at the top right, the ones that say Residential Processing, Industrial).<br/>The goal is to build a spaceship in the head of the person, this will allow the small creatures living in him to escape. To do this you have to knock over any bins you see, once you have done this, you can eat any items that fall out of the bin. By eating the items you allow the creatures living inside the person to use them.</p>\n\r\nItems To Build\r\n<p>There are 3 resources you can collect, stone, wood, and food. All of these Items can be found by knocking over bins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1. Industrial factory, build this to create technology (200 technology wins the game).<br/>2. Processing factory, build this to process the things the person eats.<br/>3. Residential houses, after you build one of these, some small creatures or people\u00a0will be generated after a short time (30 seconds)</p>\n\r\nOther Things To Know\r\n<p>Building these items takes resources, I think its like 3 wood for a residential unit, and different amounts for other things. The other people where the person lives don't like him knocking over their bins, so they will try to hit him with a bat, avoid this, as getting damaged reduces you population.<br/>If your population drops to 0, it's game over.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cbe/cbe12e4b5964e9b28d9361f952deb3bf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Aragatodag"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
