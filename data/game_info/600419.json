Yet ! I plan on keeping the game alive and update it with more and more content so keep an eye on it :)</p>\r\n How to play \r\n<p>You only need your mouse and left click on everything that upsets you to win points !<br/>To know how much time you have left, keep an eye on the clock found in the left of the screen.</p>\r\n What are the next updates ? \r\n<p>I plan on leveling up the game in terms of\u00a0 difficulty :</p>\n<p>- Adding more challenges on screen (Maybe a colleague or two might come to give you more upsetting things to do, so why not whoosh them away with your wand ? :D )</p>\r\nThank you\r\n<p>Thank you for reading &amp; don't forget to comment, I accept any feedback ! Have fun !\u00a0</p><p>Thanks to Salma for correcting the translation errors !</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-07T10:55:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/73c/73cc37df697c9a1ceb1745a7af223333.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anynahel"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
