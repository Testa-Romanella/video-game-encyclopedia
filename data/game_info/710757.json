It has come to my attention that the HTML build currently has a bug with the dagger dash, making it almost impossible to complete the game.

You play as Lumo, a Goragh' Olor or \"child of the Deviant one\" in the common tongue, venturing through the <strong><em>Whispering Hollows</em></strong>. Your goal in the game is to restore balance to the region by defeating all of the corrupted spiritual guardians of the region and returning their souls to the <em>village totem</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As of now, the game is still <strong><em>in development\u00a0</em></strong>and currently only have the first region available for the player to explore, as well as a tutorial stage and the village outskirts... So keep that in mind whilst playing! And if you liked the game or would like to see something added or changed, please drop a comment down below! It'd be greatly appreciated! :D</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A &amp; D</strong> - Directional movement</li><li><strong>Space</strong> - Jump</li><li><strong>LMB</strong> - Basic attack</li><li><strong>RMB (Hold)</strong> - Wisp bow form attack (requires a energy bar)</li><li><strong>R</strong> - Soul Skill</li><li><strong>F</strong> - Dagger (Needs to be unlocked first)</li><li><strong>E</strong> - Interact with objects and NPCs</li><li><strong>X</strong> - Uses flask to heal 3 health points</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>!!! </strong><em>CLICK THE CREDITS BANNER TO SEE THE FULL CREDITS</em>\u00a0<strong>!!!</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lumo in the Whispering Hollows was coded entirely and solely by me (Gabriel Menezes).

Thus, I want to say a big THANK YOU to every artist that shared their hard work online so people like me could make such beautiful games with their creations! Specially to Luiz Melo and Chie, for believing in me and trusting me with their beautiful art! Go and check out their work! They're amazing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-17T10:51:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/63b/63b6f21e010bae0be2ffd89e75643f48.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["imwonderr"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
