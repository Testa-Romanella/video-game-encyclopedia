This game however, doesn't let you control when you want to shoot, only in 7 second intervals making the player calculate the shot so that it counts every time. You also cannot move left or right normally, once you move left or right, you will not stop moving in that direction. Once over the side you will warp back around to the opposite side of where you went.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is my first entry into the Game Jam and I hope you enjoy!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T15:00:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/138/138c8fc6fb1f2f31cd082cb769054d45.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yonque"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
