(itch) (PurpleXYZ)", "description": "<p>\"<strong>Swipe It!</strong>\" is a casual, good mood game where your aim is to change the color of the capsules or pods in the level by swiping them with the rotating disc you control.\u00a0 You complete the game by having all the colors switched.</p>\n<p>Controls are really simple, you need to press mouse button to anchor the rotating disc to the ground and free the other disc to rotate. Remember that you can only anchor the disc to the ground, hence there needs to be ground under the disc, otherwise you will lose.</p>\n<p>A level is currently consisted of multiple stages and you complete a stage when all the capsules are converted. In the demo there's 5 stages in the first playable level.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T08:56:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/498c658a4f5f56f812230f2b74d1c243.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PurpleXYZ"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
