NO:CLIP, as the name suggests, this 70th century rocket has the power to noclip levels for a short time\u00a0to escape them! The idea is still in development so for now, its a flappy bird rip off. The core mechanic is not even done yet :( Check out the BETA version tho, see what you think! This is just a prototype so NO Menu, NO Win Screen, just levels. Will be posting a devlog soon!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Since my 3D Modelling skills are really amazing, you can see that I have an accurate version of an irl rocket:</p>\n\n<p>The NOCLIP function is there in the developer build, which Ill gladly let you play if you DM me on discord or leave a comment and ill get back to you ASAP. Unfortunately this build doesn't have it yet. Still working on it :)</p>\n<p>Soon this game will be a standalone build for linux, windows, and Mac after the beta is complete!\u00a0An android version? Maybe :) Anyway thanks for checking it out, cya!<br/></p><p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>Thanks BacaMiException, For all those unity tips and feedback.</p><p>Thanks for the huge feedback\u00a0Sanya!
