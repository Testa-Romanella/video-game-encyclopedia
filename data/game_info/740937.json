(very not low-effort, I know.) Running a marathon is as much a mental game as a physical one, since your body is surprisingly sturdy over long distances as long as you can convince your mind to keep going.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I've been following the Hal Higdon marathon training schedule (Novice 2) to prepare to run a marathon. I wondered if ever he got as famous as John Madden (RIP) and made his own video game. I'd like to imagine it would be something like this. <br/></p>\n<p>This game reflects what running a marathon is like. If you are a really experienced and determined tapper, you can probably get the marathon done in about 2 hours, getting close to a world record time. If you take things slow and easy, it'll take you anywhere between 4 to 5 hours. <br/></p>\n<p>...if anyone does make it to the end, post your time in the comments. <br/></p>\n<p>Controls: Press the space bar to start the game. Alternate pressing the left and right arrow keys to run. <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Collaborators<ul><li>Shadoulex: Runner character (Thanks it looks sweet)</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Attributions<ul><li>Footstep sounds from https://opengameart.org/content/100-cc0-sfx-2</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Developed with<ul><li>Game Engine: Unity 2020.3.11f1</li><li>Art tool (Pal): Paint.net </li><li>Effort Spent: ~4 hours</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>This project and my other low effect game jam projects are available on my low effort jam github repo: https://github.com/heyacfox/LEGJ-Submissions</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-18T09:49:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/080/080717cf672ceca3190613ef147ecd6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nhahn"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
