{"id": 328493, "slug": "blue-cloudman123", "name": "BLUE (CloudMan123)", "name_original": "BLUE (CloudMan123)", "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong><em>BLUE</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>BLUE</em></strong> is the deadliest place on Earth, and you've\u00a0just been sent there.</p>\n<p>You were sent to <strong><em>BLUE</em></strong> as a death sentence.\u00a0You have been charged with the murder of your parents, but, you didn't do it. Your uncle, James Mattington, was running low on money. The quickest way to make a quick buck was to smuggle in goods from the nearby enemy city. That would be just fine if the punishment wasn't lifetime imprisonment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your parents were once a witness to this crime so James killed them both. He stuck their bodies in the living room and burned the entire property, so no evidence was found. He then said that your father beat you daily and you killed them in a fit of rage and then set the house on fire.</p>\n<p>He claimed to be a witness to it all and said that he barely escaped. It happened in the middle of the night after curfew, so no one was out of their houses to give alibis.\u00a0You were convicted and sentenced to death via <strong><em>BLUE</em></strong>. You have been given a gun to fight off the enemies of <strong><em>BLUE</em></strong>. If you escape, than you will be set free,\u00a0but no\u00a0one thinks that you will survive.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Can you prove them wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>-Destructible Obstacles</p>\n<p>-Randomly Generated Arenas</p>\n<p>-Face off with the Super Muncher, Big Bomb, and the Head Sorcerer in strange boss battles.</p>\n<p>-Simple But Difficult Gameplay</p>\n<p>-Increasingly Hard Arena Battles</p>\n<p>-Music by Eric Skiff</p>\n<p>(http://ericskiff.com/music/)<br/></p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>W,A,S, and D to move.</p>\n<p>Aim and shoot with mouse.</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>I was going to add plenty more to the game such as Hard Mode, a tutorial, and a secret final boss fight against your uncle, but, the files got corrupted and I couldn't work on it any more. And while I was over at a friends house I make an executable as a\u00a0 test of what I had so far. After the corruption I found this file and was so relived.\u00a0So I apologize for the Gamemaker file thumbnail and the default Gamemaker loading bar, and the lack of a proper ending, and animation, and enemies. But no matter what, this is the best game I have ever made, and so i'm proud of it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-17T04:32:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5d3/5d36e4e5556b916ab696940d011aa59a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CloudMan123"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
