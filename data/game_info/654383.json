Every 5s, a new wave of rockets shows up.<br/>Have fun on your last journey!<br/></p>\r\nThe prequel\r\n<p>Yes, there is a prequel to this game ... here. It was one of my first games, made in Java with the Greenfoot environment. I wanted to see how fast I could recreate it with the new engine I use, Godot, but I ended up playing with animations, particles and sound effects. Hope you enjoy!</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Background art : Space backgrounds by TheDarkBear<br/>Musics : \"A bit of ChipTune\" by Magic_Spark<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-07T12:15:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/848/848ed8ce5eb2a05407225f64b9058fb5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lysquid"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
