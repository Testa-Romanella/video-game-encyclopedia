The game revolves around pushing each other off a platform and collecting points. This game is still in development and is unpolished.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting up multiplayer</strong></p>\n<p>To play with friends, simply choose a username and room code. Click \"Create Game\" to create a room. Once you've done this, other players can join by inputting the same room code into the join box and clicking \"Join Game\".</p>\n<p><strong>Goal of play</strong></p>\n<p>The game's core mechanic is pushing others off the map. Colliding with another player will cause you both to bounce away from each other, so position yourself to keep yourself safe and knock off opponents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collecting points which spawn at several points around the map will cause your character to grow to a maximum size. The current goal of the game is to reach this max size, making you the \"Boom Boy\" at which point you become immune to being knocked and respawns are disabled. You win when all the other players are knocked off. This may be changed later on.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Updates</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Things which I want to and probably will add in the future</p>\n<ul><li>Music</li><li>Better art</li><li>Better UI design</li><li>Improved physics</li><li>Text chats</li><li>Lobbies</li><li>More maps</li><li>Refined gameplay pacing</li><li>Jumping</li><li>Colour changing and other character options</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Current Known Bugs/Issues</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Players will sometimes not be knocked backwards when colliding with another player</li><li>The chat input field is not focusable</li><li>The game does not end when only 1 player is left</li><li>Constantly moving against the edge of a floor object allows you to grip indefinitely</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-01-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-22T06:14:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8b7/8b71bc739413a8fdede606c6c3814534.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["smurpy02"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
