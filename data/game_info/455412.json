Explore a wonderfully weird corporate office, listen to your robotic co-workers\u2019 stories, and help to solve their problems.\u00a0\r\n\r\nUltimately your goal is to find a way to escape, but your journey to freedom will give you many opportunities to brighten up the lives of others.\r\n\n\n<p>You know the program: get a job, work, retire, then die. But what if you could short circuit the employment machine, interrupt the process, and escape?</p>\n<p>You\u2019re the new hire at a dreary office, recruited after your predecessor lost his head (literally). You\u2019re expected to keep quiet, do your work, and be just another cog in a big machine, but instead you start chatting with your new colleagues.\u00a0Each of them is a robot like you, disappointed by life and despairing of ever achieving their goals, resigned to spending the rest of their days stuck at a desk and staring at a screen.</p>\n<p>However, if you can get to know your co-workers, learning about their dreams and their secret loves, you might be able to help them. In the course of bringing a little bit of happiness to a group of depressed robots, you may even discover a way to escape this dead end job and find a little happiness of your own.</p>\n\n<br/>\n\n<ul><li>A byte-sized VR adventure that can either be completed in one sitting or explored at length.</li><li>Optional quests and multiple solutions give you different paths to freedom.</li><li>Explore a charmingly odd virtual office and discover everybody\u2019s hidden secrets.</li><li>Colourfully chunky robotic visuals paired with an emotionally resonant story.</li><li>A big collection of Steam achievements to reward exploration and experimentation.</li><li>VR exclusive title for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift designed to minimise motion sickness.</li><li>If all else fails, you can find some catharsis in just trashing the place.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>OfficeBots: Reality Bytes\u00a0</em>was initially designed and programmed by an independent solo developer.
