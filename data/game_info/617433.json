NO - You are 4 Blobs!\r\n\n<p><strong>Switch between the 4 Blobs and try to connect them all to win! If you connect two, you get a special ability.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong> are really simple:</p>\n<ul><li>W A S D and Space to control a blob.</li><li>E to change to one of the other Blobs.</li><li>R to reset the Level if you messed something up</li></ul>\n<p>The <strong>Goal</strong>:</p>\n<p>Connect all 4 Blobs to win a level.</p>\n<p>Whats\u00a0<strong>special</strong>?</p>\n<p>If you connect 2 Blobs they have a special ability which is shown in the lower left screen. You can use that to your advantage!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats unfinished?</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunaly i did the whole project alone and 48h is not a lot of time to write almost every line of code new -\u00a0But overall i think it is already a good gaming-experience.</p>\n<p>There are a few bugs - for more information about that just look further down.</p>\n<p>Also because of the time limit i could only finish 4 levels which have almost no decoration.
