{"id": 3254, "slug": "journey", "name": "Journey", "name_original": "Journey", "description": "<p>Journey is an indie game placed in a setting of the vast desert. The protagonist is a nameless and speechless figure moving towards the distant mountain. The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. </p>\n<p>The game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another\u2019s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.</p>", "metacritic": 92, "released": "2012-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-14T13:52:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/baf/baf9905270314e07e6850cffdb51df41.jpg", "website": "http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/", "rating": 4.32, "rating_top": 5, "added_by_status": {"yet": 423, "owned": 4898, "beaten": 2231, "toplay": 439, "dropped": 270, "playing": 51}, "playtime": 2, "achievements_count": 112, "ratings_count": 2393, "suggestions_count": 222, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2408, "platforms": ["PC", "iOS", "PlayStation 4", "PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["thatgamecompany"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Family", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Sony Computer Entertainment", "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Annapurna Interactive"], "esrb_rating": null}
