{"id": 758846, "slug": "typehack", "name": "Typehack", "name_original": "Typehack", "description": "<p>Typehack is a prototype created for Serious Game Design (GAME 238) at Johnson County Community College.  As such, it should not be viewed as a complete and fully developed game, but rather a concept for what a full typing tutorial game could be.</p>\r\n\r\nMission Statement\r\n<p>Typehack enhances the touch-typing learning experience by reinforcing and rewarding correct hand position and technique through challenging and engaging gameplay as a counter-cyberterrorism agent</p>\r\nGame Summary\r\n<p>Defend the Central Cyber Command (CCC) servers from foreign cyberthreats and look for opportunities to strike back at the hackers using your typing skills.\u00a0 The faster and more accurate you are, the stronger your defense and the more opportunities to counterstrike you\u2019ll have.</p>\n<p>Players will be instructed on proper hand position and technique and presented a sequence of typing tasks that increase in complexity and speed.\u00a0 Players will type in keywords to thwart an active hacking attempt on the CCC servers.\u00a0 Once a threshold level of accuracy and speed are reached, a long phrase is presented as an opportunity counterattack the hacker and shutdown their connection.\u00a0 Once a hacker is thwarted, the player moves to the next level where the keywords become more challenging to type, the accuracy thresholds become tougher, and the keywords must be entered more quickly.</p>\r\nOverview of Gameplay\r\n<p>Typehack is a story-driven typing tutorial game for PC.\u00a0 As opposed to a simple drill-style tutorial such as the classic Mavis Bacon Typing or even modern tutorials such as TypingCat.com, Typehack motivates the player to learn and become better through an engaging narrative, skills-based gameplay, and an achievement badge system to reward successful hard work.</p>\r\nPlayer Experience\r\n<p>Much of the life of a counter-cyberterrorism agent is spent behind a keyboard.\u00a0 If you\u2019re to be successful, you must hone your typing skills to razor sharpness.\u00a0 Being faster and more accurate than your adversaries is the only way to succeed.\u00a0 To this end, you will use the keyboard exclusively for game commands and control.\u00a0 Right from the first screen, the Main Menu, the keyboard Function keys are what you will use to select from the options of setting your character\u2019s name, beginning a new game, loading a previously saved game, viewing the game credits, or quitting the game and returning to the desktop.</p>\n<p>Upon selecting New Game or Load Saved Game, you move to the server room where Winston \u201cFingers\u201d Gilmore gives you advice on how to position your hands and informs you on the type of keywords you will need to use to thwart the current threat.\u00a0 As you see the keywords appear on your monitor, you will need to type those words onto the terminal\u2019s command line with your keyboard.\u00a0 A horizontal timer bar will inform you on how much time you have remaining to enter the keyword in correctly.\u00a0 As you type, the colour of the keyword will change from amber to green.\u00a0 Complete the word correctly and within the time limit and you\u2019ll be presented another keyword to type.\u00a0 Make a mistake, and you\u2019ll have to start typing the keyword in again from the beginning.\u00a0 When you successfully enter all the keywords for a given mission, you\u2019ll be presented with a counter-attack phrase.\u00a0 Type this phrase in correctly and within the time limit to close the hostile agent\u2019s connection, defeating their hacking attempt.</p>\n<p>Upon completing each mission, you are graded on your accuracy and speed.\u00a0 There are three tiers of reward based on how many mistakes you made and how quickly you completed the mission.\u00a0 The top-tier reward can only be achieved by scoring 100% accuracy and completing the mission in no more than half of the allotted time.\u00a0 If you run out of time or make a mistake five times in succession, you fail the mission and must start the mission over again.\u00a0 Each new mission will present you with a more complex typing challenge and decrease the amount of time allowed per keyword.\u00a0 After completing a mission, you may always revisit the mission and continue to practice and strive for a higher reward.</p>\r\nGameplay Guidelines\r\n<p>All the language used in the dialog and all the keywords and counter-attack phrases will be age-appropriate for early-teen players.\u00a0 No profanity or sexually explicit words or phrases are allowed.\u00a0 All submitted character names are checked against a blacklist of words to prohibit inappropriate names being used.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T06:56:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13e/13ef3b0f2ac3e26998f6ac712fc1d92e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 151, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["J.
