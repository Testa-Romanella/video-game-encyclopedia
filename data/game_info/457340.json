{"id": 457340, "slug": "broken-invasion", "name": "Broken Invasion", "name_original": "Broken Invasion", "description": "<p>It simply evolved from i am writing a shop system for fun into a fully playable prototype. There is no win condition but to me being able to\u00a0beat level 10 mobs a few times feels like win since there is no further challenge.</p>\n<p>Although i soften the game at every iteration, it has very though early game to inexperienced players. And early strategical mistakes can sometimes lead to even thougher late game (lv7 and further monsters). Yet it can be beatable in 30-40 minutes at every try by myself and other tester (my brother) after some experience playing it. Although not literally a complete game it is fun way to stress relief casually and probably played it more than i programmed it (over 100 hours across the iterations)</p>\n\n<p>I am planing a complete rewrite of the project. By this i mean <strong>complete</strong> rewrite. I dont know when the final version will be avaliable but things i plan for final version are :</p>\n<ul><li>Class system : 3 different classes as melee, ranged and caster</li><li>Party combat : you will be able to recruit more characters and fight together, also mobs will be in groups of different sizes</li><li>Exploration system : It still will be in text-based. But you will be able to explore regions find forests, villages, cities, mountains etc... And travel between regions you previously explored. You will only be able to trade in civilized regions (village, town, etc)</li><li>You will be able to do work in civilized region for small extra income.</li><li>Time system, every action you take will cost you some time, your characters will require food and rest. Avaliable work in cities and tradables will refresh periodically instead of gold cost.</li><li>Monsters will be able to drop items of different rarity, and they can also drop food.</li><li>There will be a talent system, each class can pick 3 of 5 unique talents to their class</li><li>Items can break but armorer talent of melee class can prevent that, ranged class can hunt and caster can enchant items with cost of rare gems to improve them</li><li>There will be party inventory where you can carry loot or use it to swap items between characters</li><li>Bigger settlements like city will have higher price to buy /sell items. Player cant profit by trading between but can save some money by buying some items at villages and selling loot at cities.</li><li>Some items will be class specific. And using a ranged weapon required for true strike talent of a ranged character etc.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-22T03:56:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6cf/6cf5a682b73e04377f14e43b2d4d714a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 80, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Xhite"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
