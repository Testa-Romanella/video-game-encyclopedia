The wells and rivers are drying up and crops wither in the fields.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe villagers demand answers, but the gods, as ever, are silent. After a night of desperate prayer, Arha awakes \u2013 and she is not alone.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThree young men have appeared in the temple, finely dressed and impossibly beautiful, and, what is more, they claim to be gods. Powerless and confused, the four decide to travel to the First Temple to try to restore the balance of Heaven before it is too late.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAccompany three fallen deities on a journey across a dying world, where hope is all man has left. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n__________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVisual novel features:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Choice of main character name<br/>\r\n- 191,000 words<br/>\r\n- 40+ atmospheric backgrounds<br/>\r\n- 30+ CGs<br/>\r\n- 3 romance options<br/>\r\n- 7 possible endings<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\n***Please note: this game is set in an apocalypse scenario and thereby contains scenes of non-graphic, infrequent violence and the aftermath of natural disasters.
