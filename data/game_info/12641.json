It\u2019s a real-time strategy about the war on the planet of Lorn V. The expansion added new maps and the Imperial Guard race to the game and simplified some game mechanics and units.</p>\n<p>You can take control of one of five races: Orks, Eldar, Chaos, Space Marines, and the Imperial Guard. The plot is divided into the Order storyline and the Disorder storyline, represented by different races. No matter what path you choose, the game starts with the confrontation of these sides; you have to deal with the consequences of their battle and make decisions that will affect the story.</p>\n<p>The game features such classic RTS aspects as building a base and technology development. However, the gameplay focuses on tactics. Every race in the game has its unique units you can use during missions. As a rule, it\u2019s not the entire army that takes part in battles, but a limited amount of units. To be efficient you need to manage these units separately.</p>", "metacritic": 85, "released": "2005-09-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-25T17:08:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/cc2/cc2e6c7aee44854f93063622fe08f197.jpg", "website": "http://www.dawnofwar.com", "rating": 3.93, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 85, "owned": 1742, "beaten": 186, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 49, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 241, "suggestions_count": 561, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 241, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Relic Entertainment"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": ["SEGA", "THQ"], "esrb_rating": "Mature"}
