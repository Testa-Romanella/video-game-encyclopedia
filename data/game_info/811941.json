Mobile web app! Made for the 2021 winter game jam at UW. Art by\u00a0pandapaints861.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to lead your hive to survive and grow as long as possible!<br/></p>\n<p>Bees visiting flowers collect honey and pollen, and they add it to your hive when they return. However, if they crash into each other, they drop what they are carrying and refuse to work until sent back to the hive!</p>\n<p>The hive constantly consumes honey at a rate proportional to the hive's population, and it adds a worker every time it collects enough pollen.</p>\n<p>Drag on a bee to give it a path to follow. Drag from the hive to send out a new bee.</p>\n<p>The title screen is interactive, so give the mechanics a go before starting a game!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-01T14:58:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a96/a96931769275cf98c6fcce6ccfd164f0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["alnis"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
