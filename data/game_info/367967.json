{"id": 367967, "slug": "magmate", "name": "MagMate", "name_original": "MagMate", "description": "Before introducing the game...\r\n<p>This is an idea\u00a0that have been in my head for quite a long time and I finally decided to make it into a playable prototype. Currently it is pretty rough (and short) and I'm still working on its final mechanism, but for the very first version, hope you enjoy.<br/></p>\n\r\nMagMate\r\n<p>MagMate is a physic 2D graphic-style puzzle game with \u2018Magnet\u2019 as its main theme. Players will need to solve different puzzles to collect items. The game requires players to have some very basic physic knowledge, a creative mind, and quick reactions(I guess?).\u00a0</p>\n\r\nThe Settings\r\n<p>In the middle of the screen, there is a horizontal\u00a0line. A pair of magnets (Mr. Red &amp; Mr. Blue) on both sides of the plane are attracted by each other. When they are attached together, they can be regarded as a whole piece of magnet, and each part is one pole of it.\u00a0The upper and lower part of the space is not connected, there are some asymmetric floating objects or physical elements.</p>\n\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Players will need to use keys such as \u2018Esc\u2019 \u2018P\u2019 \u2018R\u2019 to change between pages. \u2018ASDW\u2019 and \u2018Left Down Right Up\u2019 are used to control the upper and lower character accordingly. \u2018S\u2019 and \u2018Down\u2019 can flip the character while \u2018W\u2019 and \u2018Up\u2019 can demagnetize or magnetize the character.</p>\n<p>If your two hands can not cooperate nicely, find a friend that you trust in\u00a0to play with you ; )</p>\n\r\nOpening the game\u00a0\r\n<p>Unzip the file, open the 'release' folder and double click 'MagMate.exe'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Extremely sorry but currently the game only supports windows.
