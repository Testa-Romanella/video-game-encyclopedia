It was made for the game jam \"Make something horrible 2019\", hence the short development time and rather lousy graphics... Nevertheless, I hope that you will enjoy it.</p>\n<p>There are a few historical inaccuracies, which I'll discuss in a log entry. By the way, I don't speak good Russian so I had to use an automatic translation often times - I hope I didn't let too many mistakes slip in. If the English translation sucks its all my fault though.</p><p>Edit 2019-09-22 : version 1.1 is now (a little) less difficult.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T06:17:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a16/a16767808eebfc4d8b2e0603a898c0b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LeRan"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
