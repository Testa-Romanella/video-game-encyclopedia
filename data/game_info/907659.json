Their origins and motives are unknown, but their tyranny leads <strong>Myro</strong>, one of the few known survivors, into hiding. However, with no way of fighting back, Myro is at a standstill... until a strange, hooded man gifts him a gun that contains enchanted properties, later found out to be the titular <strong>Oblivion Eagle</strong>. Now with a means of defending himself, Myro begins his rise against the Onis, finding out who they are, what they want, and the dark truth that's under it all.<br/><br/><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><br/><br/><strong>Oblivion Eagle</strong> is a light-gun game where you use your mouse and keyboard to shoot and destroy enemies. Enemies launch colored attacks.<br/><br/><ul><li>Shoot their <strong>blue</strong> attacks before they hit the screen's edge</li></ul><ul><li>Dodge their <strong>red</strong> attacks before they hit your crosshair</li></ul><br/>The game strikes a beautiful dynamic of <strong>shooting blue</strong> while <strong>dodging red</strong>, leading to a fresh, frantic, and fast-paced action game unlike any other. Even if you have never played another light-gun game, Oblivion Eagle is perfect for anyone to pick up and play. A color-blind mode is available, too!<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>OTHER MECHANICS</h3><br/><br/>On top of shooting and dodging, the game also has <strong>RPG elements</strong>. Completing stages leads to leveling up stats and learning new <strong>skills</strong>. Skills mix up the combat and add more depth than just clicking. Depending on the skills equipped, you can launch...<br/><br/><ul><li>Wide shots that cover lots of space</li></ul><ul><li>Charged blasts that deal huge damage</li></ul><ul><li>Protective walls that block almost any attack</li></ul><br/>...and many, many other moves. Aside from that are <strong>mods</strong>. Mods are passive abilities that can grant a multitude of benefits, such as...<br/><br/><ul><li>Increased HP</li></ul><ul><li>Bigger shots</li></ul><ul><li>Revival after death</li></ul><br/>...and a series of other bonuses. <strong>Skills</strong> and <strong>mods</strong> can make the difference between a sweeping victory or a total blunder, so try them all and see what build works best for you!<br/><br/><h3>CREDITS</h3><br/><br/><strong>Nick Donnoli</strong> - Creator, programmer, composer, and writer<br/><strong>Sarah Lam</strong> - Art manager<br/><strong>Senpai Sam</strong> - Artist<br/><strong>Soren</strong> - Artist<br/><br/>This game contains flickering images and patterns that may trigger seizures in those with photosensitive epilepsy.
