Try and work out the best combination of power, brakes and handling that works best for your driving style!</p>\n<p>Designed for the use of Xbox360 controller but can use keyboard control as required.</p>\n<p>Xbox 360 Controller:</p>\n<p>A - Accelerate, B - Brake, Start - Menu, Back - Info</p>\n<p>Keyboard:</p>\n<p>Left Shift - Accelerate, Left Ctrl - Brake, Escape- Menu, F1- Info</p>\n\n<p>Please vote on my Ludum Dare Entry here:</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/$63893<br/></p>\n<p>Attributions:</p>\n<p>Trees:</p>\n<p>https://opengameart.org/content/trees-and-bushes</p>\n<p>Music from Whatfunk:</p>\n<p>http://whatfunk.com/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9eb/9eb95e258f7ccde8fd23b2a9b911f521.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Beefsports"], "genres": ["Sports", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
