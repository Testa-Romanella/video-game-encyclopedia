Each player starts with 3 barrels of oil which they can spend on various units. On their turn, a player can move and attack with each of their units in any order. They also have the opportunity to spend barrels on additional units.\r\n</p>\n<p>Barrels can be collected by moving onto their space or destroyed to damage adjacent units. Objects such as windows, sandbags, rocks, and trees can be used as cover; each of which has a 50% chance of blocking shots from non-adjacent units. Barbed wire blocks movement but does not provide cover. Barrels, sandbags, and barbed wire are placed randomly at the beginning of each game.</p>\n<p>Units:</p>\n<p>-Infantry (2 for 1 barrel): low movement, normal range, killed in one hit</p>\n<p>-Infiltrator (2 for 1 barrel): high movement, low range, killed in one hit</p>\n<p>-Sniper (1 for 1 barrel): low movement, unlimited range in same row/column, killed in one hit</p>\n<p>-Specialist (1 for 1 barrel): low movement, normal range, creates explosion at target</p>\n<p>-Tank (1 for 3 barrels): low movement, normal range, creates explosion at target, killed in one hit from Specialist or other Tank OR in three hits from other units, can drive through objects</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-16T05:07:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a4c/a4c0abba90d5b6783b19945c779fb5e5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 182, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Aidan B"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
