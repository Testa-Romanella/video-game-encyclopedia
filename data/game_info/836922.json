It has been in development for the past 4-5 years.<br/></p>\n<p>King's Crook will be an open-world RPG with a focus on action, combat, and stealth. You play as a professional thief who was let out of prison by the King in order to aid him in getting stolen goods returned to the crown.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>For curious programmers:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>This game is written from scratch entirely in standard C using no 3rd party libraries or game engines. The whole game is written using integers only, there are no floating point types or literals anywhere in the code. The game is software rendered meaning all the graphics are being rendered on the CPU. The whole game is single-threaded. Audio is mixed in software.</p>\n<p>Art, sound effects, music, models, and animations are also made by myself.</p>\n<p>I also created a map editor and a simple 3D modeling program to make maps/models for the game. Both of these pieces of software are written using the same principles as the game (C, integer-only, no 3rd party libraries, etc...).<br/></p>\n<p>This is my passion/hobby project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Link to King's Crook Discord server:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>https://discord.com/invite/hdYctSmyQJ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-19T11:13:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8de/8de76239b73757a93a311f88a9380caa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["EMMIR"], "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
