The mechanics are similar to Flappy Bird, but with a few twists - the player still uses a one-button control system to flap along the screen, but some extra physics, collectables and enemies create a bit more of a challenge vs. reward system. The graphics are in the style of Super Mario Bros, but are original renderings of the iconic terrain, enemies, and items.</p><p>Available for Mac and PC!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32d/32d4c3b0f9d38abb19d8da40ee619e85.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 18, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Andrew Jason Santos"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
