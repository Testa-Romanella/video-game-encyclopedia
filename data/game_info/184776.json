If the temperature of a so called superconductor falls under the critical temperature, the electrical resistance falls to nearly zero. But it is not all! If a magnet lies under the superconductor it began to levitate.</p>\n<p>In this game, the player has to change the temperature of a superconductor and use the levitate effect to reach the end of each level.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game is an entry for the GDL Quantum Jam\u00a0. (Unfortunately I read so much about Quantum Physics that I totally forgot the real \u00a0theme of this game jam, which was Super Position. Now I created a game, which uses coherent states of matter, another field of Quantum Physics. I hope you enjoy this little game anyway)</p>\n<p>Engine is Unity 5.
