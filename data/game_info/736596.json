RoomJam transforms your room, your apartment or the whole house with all of its objects into a virtual game world. Defend your walls from the incoming monsters, walk freely around the whole space, take cover behind your furniture and protect your home!\u00a0</p>\n<p>With RoomJam you scan your environment in a blink of an eye and transform your surroundings into a completely different world in just a few minutes. Experience RoomJam now as the first application of the House Scale VR SDK by 2Sync!</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>\r\nYour apartment is under attack! The monsters are rushing towards your walls and trying to break through! Take your weapon on your holster and defend the waves of monsters. If a monster does make it to the wall, you can repair it by holding your hand against the wall. So always move around the room and keep an eye on all the walls. If an object is in front of your wall, the monsters will not attack them. How long will you be able to keep the monsters away? \r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nCurrently you are defending your apartment alone. With the next release, you will be able to call in your friends to help you defend!\r\n</p>\r\nHOW TO SCAN YOUR SPACE\r\n<p>With RoomJam you can capture your environment in a few simple steps and then play in any room. We explain you how to do it in less than 1 minute:</p>\n<p>It is important to set up the Guardian on your Oculus Quest correctly before using RoomJam. You can either set your Roomscale Guardian to be slightly larger than your room, or you can completely deactivate the Guardian in the Quest settings. You may need to restart the Quest after doing this, but afterwards you can experience a whole new level of VR!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAfter that, you can start RoomJam and define your virtual playspace by confirming all room corners. Short instructions will show you how. Of course you can also scan multiple connected rooms.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nAfterwards, you need to scan each object, i.e. furniture, plants and so on, by drawing a bounding box around it with your\u00a0controller.\u00a0\u00a0If you are done it is recommended to tag all non horizontal objects (eg. plants and lamps) to provide RoomJam the possibility to generate the most imersive\u00a0virtual world.</p>\n<p>And that's it! RoomJam now turns your room into a virtual world and you're ready to go!</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please note: Even though RoomJam shows you all scanned objects in the room, please move carefully and pay attention to yourself, other people and objects.</em>\n</p>\r\nWHATS NEXT\r\n<p>\r\nRoomJam is an official TechDemo of the House Scale VR SDK 2Sync. We want to keep developing RoomJam and the SDK and demonstrate what is possible through House Scale VR experiences. We are also in the starting blocks to offer you a multiplayer mode and many other features soon.\u00a0\u00a0The current version will therefore only be available for free for a limited time until the release of the multiplayer!</p>\n<p>We always appreciate your feedback!\u00a0Also, if you ever run into any issues, please just write us and we'll do our best to solve it right away for you! You can always contact us under Hello@Roomjam.2Sync.io</p>\n<p>\r\nYou like House Scale VR experiences and want to turn your own ideas into reality? How about a tactical shooter throughout the apartment? Or a meditation application? There are so many new possibilities! If you are interested in creating House Scale VR applications yourself or want to share ideas with us, you can always reach out to us through our website at https://2sync.io/!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nThank you and Cheers <br/>\r\nMoritz &amp; Julian\r\n</p>\n\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING\r\n<p><strong>My Quest tells me that I have left the Guardian: </strong>\r\nPlease adjust your Guardian before starting RoomJam. It needs to have at least the size of your room or needs to be deactivated in the Oculus settings. The video above shows you how!\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>I want to play on a larger area than the Guardian allows:</strong> The Quest only allows a Guardian up to a certain size. In this case, please completely disable the Guardian on the Quest. To turn off the Guardian system, the first thing you need is a developer account. You can create one by visiting developer.oculus.com. It will only take a few minutes, and approval is generally fast.\u00a0By a short Google search you will always find the latest instructions.\u00a0Afterwards, you can define walls in RoomJam that extend over several rooms or the whole house, for example!<br/></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\r\nThe monsters are not attacking my walls: \r\n</strong>\r\nThe monsters will only attack walls that don't have objects in front of them, so that you can easily repair them. If you don't have a free wall in your room, please scan the room when starting RoomJam in such a way that you draw the virtual wall in front of the objects. For example, if a large wardrobe covers the whole wall, you can simply drag the virtual wall in RoomJam in front of this wardrobe. This way you can easily get to your virtual walls and the monsters will run towards you again!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Can I also scan objects hanging from the ceiling?\r\n</strong> Yes, you can do that. However, RoomJam will always display the object as if it were reaching the floor for your own safety.</p>\n<p><strong>My objects are slightly shifted:\u00a0</strong>\r\nPlease start the Edit Room &gt; Recalibration Mode inside the game to recalibrate your objects using the corners of your room.</p>\n<p><strong>The height of my objects is not correct:</strong>\r\nAs a height reference, we are using the height given from the Oculus Quest. To reset the height please go to your Guardian's settings inside the Quest and adjust the height accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T05:26:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e10/e10c1ad3c13c5ec8e65e8f6481211730.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 311, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["2Sync"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
