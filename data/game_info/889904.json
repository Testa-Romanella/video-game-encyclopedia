{"id": 889904, "slug": "raiders-of-ruin", "name": "Raiders of Ruin", "name_original": "Raiders of Ruin", "description": "In Raiders of Ruin, you guide a group of 5 champions sent on a quest to seize the throne of the Underworld itself. Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy!<h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Over <strong>40 boss fights,</strong> each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. <br/></li><li><strong>No game-overs:</strong> Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. <br/></li><li>Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the <strong>Boss Log,</strong> where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own!<br/></li><li>Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. <strong>Swap classes before any battle</strong> to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. <br/></li><li><strong>9 main classes to choose from.</strong> Need more firepower? Swap that Paladin for a Wizard. Expecting a long fight? Try poisoning your foe with a Rogue.<br/></li><li><strong>Multiple subclasses</strong> for most classes, providing even more customization. Should your Ranger be a Hunter, or a Survivalist?<br/></li><li><strong>Innovative rematch system</strong> that replaces traditional level-grinding. Instead of fighting normal enemies repeatedly, you will occasionally be given the opportunity to rematch a boss of your choosing for a second chance at its rewards (though this system is entirely optional). <br/></li><li><strong> MIDI soundtrack</strong> inspired by PC games of the early 2000's, with some modern twists. <br/></li><li>A backpack that might be alive?</li></ul><br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>\"I won't waste my time trying to plead with you.
