The art is very rough because I was focusing on the story and figuring out how Tyranobuilder worked. There are a few errors here and there that I will sort out on a future version. I want to get this first part out to see how it does and get any feedback I can on the story and how to make the visual novel better. I appreciate you taking the time check out this game I made. It shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes to go through it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/499/49959b254c8ded2b7ddbfd4c8f6c2aa8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["BenjaminAG"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
