Set up the cards in a grid to build the best poker hands vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. You have four skill levels, with the choice of one or two stacks of cards, face-up or face-down.<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple. You just drag cards from the stacks to the grid. Be careful, though, because you cannot move a card once it has been played. You'll need careful planning and a little luck to get a great score.
