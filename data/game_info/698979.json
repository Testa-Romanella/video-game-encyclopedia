So to help me learn Unreal Engine i decided to create this project, Blue Vs Red or BVR for short. Its a simple non interactive game that is based around two Factions locked in an everlasting war across planets. <br/>A loose backstory is (you could call them aliens), but essentially the little Troops/Tanks you see in the game\u00a0are made up of pure Energy or Life force, they come from a home solar system with a red sun and a blue sun and a single planet split down the middle between the two colours.<br/>There are 16 Maps total to watch the Ai fight on, the Goal is to destroy the Enemy's HQ building, they work off random movement/waypoints to guide them towards each other, they all only have collision with no bullets (yet).<br/>All music is also made by me along with all of the low res textures and models.<br/>This is just a project i quite enjoy working on, and its in a good enough state now i think other people might hopefully enjoy it too.<br/>Windows Only.<br/>No settings menu. (yet)<br/>Test PC Specs with decent Performance:<br/>4th Gen i7/32gb DDR3/GTX 1050ti<br/><br/>Updated from .95 to .96 and fixed no audio on one of the maps.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-22T10:01:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/76e/76efcf2bf2256b309649b1dbac943ec7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 250, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robnug95"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
