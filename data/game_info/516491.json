Based on the text above those articles (in the middle of the screen), which tells you piece of information currently trending, you have to make a choice. Each article represents a different choice.<br/></p>\n\n<p>On top of the screen there is a bar with 4 images.</p>\n<ol><li>Finances</li><li>Popularity</li><li>Chaos</li><li>Doubt</li></ol>\n<p>These 4 attributes fill or deplete based on the choices that you make. By hovering over each article, these icons either:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Stay the same - the attribute will not fill or deplete upon picking that choice</li><li>Grow a bit - The attribute will fill or deplete a little bit</li><li>Grow a lot - The attribute will fill or deplete significantly</li></ol>\n<p>Whenever you completely fill or deplete one of these attributes, the game gives you a bad ending. Being able to balance through the attributes through all articles without failing will give you a good ending. But can you achieve that ? :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team members: </strong>(Usernames from Discord)<br/></p>\n<p>Bud#0006<br/></p>\n<p>Aspect#0243<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources:<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Office Background Sound </em>- Vilkas Sound</p>\n\n<p><em>Page Turning Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Paper Crumple Crumpling Scrunch Crunch Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Pen Click Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Cabinet Lock Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Cup on table Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Typing Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T<br/><em>Double click mouse Sfx </em>- Sound Effect By Nicole Marie T</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T03:14:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c99/c991a83e0567567fe7aea05e6a7870f2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 69, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Michalidis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
