{"id": 565461, "slug": "party-foul-2", "name": "Party Foul", "name_original": "Party Foul", "description": "<p>By: Team Aces</p>\n<p>The idea for the game was to start out with a cleaning simulator where you needed to clean your house after a crazy party. The twist being that after a little bit of cleaning, you find a dead body, and being the teenager that you are, and knowing you weren\u2019t supposed to have the party, you now need to clean the house while hiding the body before your parents get home.</p>\n<p>However, as all game jams go, not all functionality is fully working. Right now the body flies all over the, the parent doesn\u2019t exactly look believable, and there are currently no good ways of hiding the body. Most of our problems didn\u2019t actually even come from trying to make the game but instead, from good ole github. However, this was a fun and learning experience, and even though the full product is finished, it is a quite satisfying game to play.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-01T05:12:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/23722baf7e5f01cf7ac15282d432ce7e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TeamChaos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
