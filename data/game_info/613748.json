I'm now stupidly sleep-deprived for someone who just barely managed to make an intro, but it was fun.</p>\n<p>The idea was that you have to move this A.I. to were he needs to be to solve a problem, and his super advanced algorithms will figure out exactly what he needs to do, and he'll do it.</p>\n<p>It becomes somewhat of a puzzle game when the problems get more complex and his actions start becoming harder to anticipate. Supposedly, it's because he's thinking so far ahead that it takes you a while to realise what's happening; but until it happens, you can't be sure. That's why it's called No Context. I\u00a0just wanted to clarify that since without this particular context, it appears to just be a game made entirely of context making the name makes no sense\u00a0:V</p>\n<p>Of course, I\u00a0didn't get that far.\u00a0I\u00a0worked almost non-stop, but I <em>did not</em> use my time wisely for the\u00a0short timeframe. Looking back, it seems like I\u00a0was looking for any excuse not to just start building the damn levels. I made a neat dialog system, though. That's why I'm a programmer and not a game designer lol</p>\n<p>I have a lot of ideas for the game\u00a0that I like too much though, so I'll have to continue it after the jam, and after some sleep.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T04:20:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90a10a69ccd624d676bf0ce37515f46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["PotatoesBasket"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
