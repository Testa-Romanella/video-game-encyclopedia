For this and other reasons I'd much prefer you to download without donating, and only consider donating if you enjoyed the game (and were able to play it). If you're having difficulty getting this game to run on your system, please leave me a comment with your OS and I might be able to figure out building this for you. In either case, you should be able to run this from source code on most systems with the latest python 3 and pygame.<br/></p>\n<p>Feel free to check out and download the source code on the github page.<br/><br/>Brought to you by JovialKnoll + tinsil.</p>\n<p>By the way: you can check out a picrew style monster maker featuring the monsters from this game on my website.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-11T05:07:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/871/871a6bc4e2c87d56266878a17e8a2826.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["JovialKnoll"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
