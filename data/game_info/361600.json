Try, and try again and you can succeed!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Too fast for you? Want to train at slower speeds? Not challenging ENOUGH? Change it up in the settings! There are also settings to reduce/remove camera motion and other effects that may affect some players.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong>:<br/>Kartik Kini- Gameplay coding, visual design, level design<br/>Eric Cook- Backend / systems development<br/>Zachary Woomer- Sound Design<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e67/e67505eca932d2b4979839971146c9f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["Finite Reflection"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
