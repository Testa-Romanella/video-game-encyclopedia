Please donate if you can.</p>\n<p>I will probably never update or improve this game unless anybody actually cares enough to ask. Either way, thank you for playing.</p>\n<p>This game was just an experiment to test the ropes of Ren'Py, but that doesn't mean the story I'm telling isn't important. Abortion is a human right, and no one gets to control our bodies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right now, this is all I can do to remind myself of that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T23:33:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/304/3047ac04a815a9f6cfaa025e2e7b49e0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["undertaker"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
