And will you be able to keep yourself from being burned by it?\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tAs the daughter of a Viscount, and heiress to a small fortune, you are invited back into society even after years of seclusion at your family's estate.\r\n\t<br/>\r\n\tThe upcoming Season is to be spent in Bath, your childhood friend having finally convinced you into it, and only the cream of society will be there. But the fickle and difficult dance that is weaving through society can be a tricky thing to remember, especially when they thrive on any small misstep you may make.\r\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\tBut which partner is selected to help guide you through the maze of the upper classes is always left down to \r\n\t<em>The Lady's Choice</em>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t--\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Lady's Choice</em> is a light visual novel set in Regency times and will be route based.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe goal is to give the feel of a regency romance novel, but an interactive one!\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\r\n\tThough it is a historical visual novel, it's not going to be completely accurate (for example, they didn't really have a Season in Bath). I have taken liberties because, well, I wanted to have fun with this rather than freak about every nuance of historical accuracy.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThis was started for NaNoReNo 2016 gamejam.\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d9/3d9af6a5eecba8dd58b20f4af139a23e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "beaten": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Seraphinite"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
