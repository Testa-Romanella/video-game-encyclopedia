It's an ode to the classic 2D action-arcade games such as Secret of Mana\u2122 or The Legend of Zelda\u2122, that became a fundamental part of gaming history and captivated players for many years.</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>KINGDOM\u00b7OF\u00b7LOOT</strong> seeks to bring back the timeless feel of these classics while answering the question: how would they have been if based in a global mass multiplayer system? An immersive persistent world to explore, tons of loot to collect, new friendships to forge and adventures to live and strongly focuses on collecting, crafting and sharing in-game loot. You decide whether doing it on your own, with a small group of friends, a guild or joining hundreds of other players on your quest for epic gear.<br/><br/>We are a small but dedicated team located in Germany.
