Originally people would dress\u00a0as the dead or as terrifying nightmares so that the invading spectres\u00a0would ignore them, thinking them to also be malevolent spirits.</p>\n<p>In <strong>HELLoween</strong> you play a group of kids or teens out trick-or-treating when the town is overrun by horrific beings from beyond.\u00a0Will you be able to send them back where they belong, simply\u00a0survive the night, or perish like so many others?</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by <em>Universalis</em> by Ralph Mazza &amp; Mike\u00a0Holmes.</p>\n<p>There is no GM/player division like there is in traditional RPGs.\u00a0Instead, all players are jointly responsible for the story and the\u00a0actions of NPCs, as well as for their own PC.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-01T09:53:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d68/d6821dbd1c52ce7cec848f09533c9aa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Games 4 Geeks"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
