The game is currently still in development. It is planned\u00a0to feature 7 unique types of units, each with unique properties and skills, and 7 maps with 5 different types of terrain. More maps and features may be added later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little bit about myself the developer: I am currently a college student major in Visual Media Arts at Emerson, with strong interest in game development. I started this project with an intention to learn about Unity as well as 3D-asset creation. I've been working on this game by myself for roughly 5 months. It is not perfect, but I will polish it more and more as I dive deeper into Unity. During the process,\u00a0I would highly appreciate any feedback:)</p>\n<p>Some notes: If it is your first time playing this type of game, it is highly recommended that you go through the \"info\" section in the main menu to learn about some basics of the game. You are also welcome to dive directly into the game and explore the mechanics on your own.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c8/8c8f3bbb46cebab99fa1ebf47f3fda06.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["LeoTheCatMeow"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
