It instructs an extremist vampire to gather an\u00a0army of morally corrupt devotees and attack the city of Norsdale. The boy is scared to death because he and his dearest friends assume that the army is after the crystal skull they obtained in the mountains, however, the situation\u00a0is not what it seems. Coraline Onionhead, a prodigious technomancy professor at Norsdale's university, discovers that the vampire sent by the Veiled Nocturne is focusing his attention on the local mental institution that treats\u00a0radicalization. The revelation\u00a0alarms Treyton and co. because Norsdale is notable for its direct refusal to condone discrimination in any shape or form and the facility is full of inmates that want nothing more than to tear apart\u00a0the city's diversity and potentially its existence. And for what? To satisfy their beliefs and appease their vampiric shepherd. Treyton must see to it that the vampire is not within sniffing distance of the mental institution to\u00a0save Norsdale and its integrated society. Featuring music composed by Matt Waldron.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-04T04:13:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f4/4f422f73231e9f864102b92fb130fc6b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 185, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DArkInfern0Crystal1"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
