The crew did everything they could to try and develop a weapon in self defense but no conventional types would work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They all perished, building a countermeasure which relied on the technology of laser beams.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>These beams were stored into color coded shells which could be loaded with the use of some old boat telegraphs, a few buttons, a cars gear stick and an old train whistle. All of which was recycled from things that were in the ships museum.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>The only remaining survivor, (you)\u00a0must set the colors in the loading bay, using the levers to match the color sequence of the enemy ship. Then press the red button to fire the laser!</p>\n<p>There is only ONE round to fire, so it must be correct, or the enemy ship will survive and eventually destroy your ship.</p>\n<p>Press the yellow button to cheat, and see the enemy ships color code order.\u00a0<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Alt+F4 to quit.</strong></p>\n<p>This game is purely experimental.\u00a0 Updates to come in the future.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>All 'donations' solicited through this project will be considered full payments.
