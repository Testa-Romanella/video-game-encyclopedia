It even has a separate set of collectibles to find. Speaking of collectables, Fall Flip is scattered with symbols called runes, which must be found and returned to their associated runestone. This is not necessary to complete the level, but the runes make for a fun extra challenge!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to these sources for compensating for my lack of artistic skill:</p>\n<p>Title Screen Music from https://www.zapsplat.com</p>\n<p>8-bit March by Twin Musicom</p>\n<p>Player Character modified from:\u00a0https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-06T09:42:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/775/775a9a477c7c28986e17619b2c606a36.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MatthewD"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
