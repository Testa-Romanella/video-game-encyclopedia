You were summoned by the Firegod to find all flowers and rescue frozen ones. You can trade your flowers with Firegod. He will grant you fireballs that can meld down the frozen flowers. Be careful though, frozen flowers are quite feisty and dangerous, so do not get hit by them!</p>\n<p>This is my first game created with UE4 (2nd overall, 1st one was for Ludum Dare). I started learning UE4 one week before the Spring Jam started and immediately fell in love with it. UE4 has great videos on GameJams on their YouTube channel, where most of the things in game were taken from.</p>\n<p>#### Controls:<br/>WASD - Movement<br/>LShift - Spring<br/>E or Space - Action<br/>LMouseButton - Shoot</p>\n<p>#### Team name: (solo developer) debuggerpls<br/>#### Game name: Spring spectacular<br/>#### Submission name: debuggerpls_SpringSpectacular.zip<br/>#### Everything was created by me during the jam, except for audio assets and UE4 Starter Content that are listed in CREDITS.txt.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:55:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/349/34960f2cabd17c259a71befbb241ab00.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 79, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["debuggerpls"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
