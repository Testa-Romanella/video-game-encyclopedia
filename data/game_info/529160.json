Who knew! So we've been hanging out here in the sticks for a while, waiting\u00a0for that stuff to chill out. And by a while, I\u00a0mean <strong>1024 YEARS</strong>. And by the sticks, I\u00a0mean space. Or something.\u00a0You could say, <strong>\"IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET\"</strong>. If you were so inclined.</p>\n<p>But there's hope. We have this cool new tech that will help us fix our oopsies. What if drones, but vacuum cleaners?\u00a0Woah, totally new invention! We figure that each drone will last <strong>EXACTLY 60 SECONDS</strong> in the fallout before crumbling to\u00a0dust, enough time to pick up at least some of those pesky\u00a0nuke poops. And when our drones pick up <strong>PRECISELY 2,147,483,647</strong> of those suckas (don't ask me why that number), it's <strong>HOME TIME BABY</strong><strong>!</strong></p>\n<p>So yeah.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>\"IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET\"</strong>. I don't know why, but that phrase has been\u00a0buzzing around my head. Maybe I\u00a0just need to get some sleep; I've been up for the past 7 days...</p>\r\nControls?\r\n<p>Totally. Use <strong>WASD </strong>or<strong> arrow key</strong>s to move.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Use <strong>Q</strong> and <strong>E</strong> or<strong> right shift</strong> and<strong> right ctrl</strong> to move up and down.</p>\n<p>Use the <strong>mouse </strong>to spin around. Go nuts.</p>\r\nRay tracing?\r\n<p>Ray tracing. You need a compatible graphics card (e.g. NVidia RTX 3080) to do that, though. Good for you getting hold of one of those. If you don't have one, don't worry about it. Still works, not as shiny.</p>\r\nProcedurally Generated?\r\n<p>Yes, procedurally generated. City layouts and isotope droppings are different every time you play.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame Jams?\r\n<p>Glad you asked!\u00a0This game is part of Epic Megajam 2020, 7DFPS, and PROCJAM. Game jams are cool.</p>\r\nQuestions?\r\n<p>send tweet @lasersink</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-11T05:19:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9d4/9d437e1af38e2df8a0cfcdd291aac803.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["lasersink"], "genres": ["Action", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
