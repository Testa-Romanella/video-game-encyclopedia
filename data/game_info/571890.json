Unfortunately, I had to spend a lot of time debugging collision, but what I ended with is still playable and interesting.</p>\n<p>You control a large white triangle that contains three bouncing balls. Click and drag the corners of the triangle to reshape it. Colorful, collectable triangles will spawn randomly on the field. Your goal is to guide the ball of the matching color to each collectable triangle. If you collect a triangle with a ball of the wrong color, the game is over (it pauses for 5 seconds, then restarts). More collectables will spawn the longer you last. How many can you get?</p>\n<p>There is a bug where the balls can sometimes escape your triangle through one of the corners. This happens when the corner has a particularly sharp angle, and can be remedied by widening that angle.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-15T03:51:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6c/a6c0fa7eeca9c5fdbb3481c333ebd3e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Birdwards"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
