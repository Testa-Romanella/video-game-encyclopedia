You can play it as is or know more by go on reading:<br/><br/>The idea comes from an experienced ADHD trainer\u00a0Stella Cheung.\u00a0 For the past 20 years, Stella specialized in teaching ADHD kids how to live in the pre-set society which doesn't exactly go in their way. By doing so, instead of learning to \"be normal\", Stella implemented the concept of \"color area\" for ADHD kids to better understand themselves and to explain to others what is up in their mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyday, for everyone, we periodically goes into different color zones, namely Green, Black and Red. Green means we are normal, just nothing special and go on with our life, mind our own business. Black means we are in the zone, mind ridden flying carpet in the outer space or deep down in the Atlantic ocean exploring Titanic, anything but not paying attention to the reality. Red means that we are too emotional, be it raging or depressed, to turn the whole world upside down just to do what we want to do. These all are nothing special except ADHD kids and adults would have much higher proportion of time going into the Black and Red zone, or much more frequently and abruptly jumping from zone to zone. This makes them unable to carry out daily tasks. Things as simple as forgotten their gas bill would leave them depressed and guilt them enough to blame their whole life - but soon they will forget because of their turbo brain. This is absolutely fine until they have to live with \"normal\" person who has no idea what's going on with them.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>This game aims to deliver this concept to everyone in the world to better accommodates ADHD individuals to the society. Because of their turbo paced brain, they are actually smart and highly capable for tasks that need improvisation and creativity. ADHD would actually turns out to be a gift for them and for the society after suitable understanding, education and training especially in this digital and internet era.</p>\n<p>This game is pending for expansion. In the future we will improve the game by adding features that could train ADHD kids to focus and be multi-tasking.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/64a/64a70ab73710e87c84e2eb0e00a2b91b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 44, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["meaningless"], "genres": ["Action", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
