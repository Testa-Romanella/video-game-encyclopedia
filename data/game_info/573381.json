All in all, it's just a fun art piece I wanted to share, any feedback is more than welcome!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T05:01:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e14/e14ab31cb40bef2afbfdeb42b1090203.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Lmiller"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
