The double basket design features a torsion\u2011flex arm that maintains proper ground tension and allows the basket to flex over uneven terrain. The result is a more consistent performance that levels and finishes the soil in one pass...preparing a more uniform seed bed composed of finer soil at planting depth to help retain proper moisture and large particles on top to reduce crusting.\r\n</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy. This thing has been a huge PITA since FS19. I have finally got it to behave in a manner that I am comfortable to release it. Features 32 ft working width, 3 color configs,\u00a0 X Fold,\u00a0 Flex wings, baskets on joints so they will follow the ground, the baskets are also scripted as wheels so they turn your actual ground speed and not just a speed rotating part.\r\nThis TF 212 pairs well behind machines like OS Farms Sunflower Cultivator, disks, etc. \u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>Thank you all for your continued support. It is great appreciated!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-10T05:17:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df9/df9daf23cbecb6f632b5a40745e3c521.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 299, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Cunningham Modding"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
