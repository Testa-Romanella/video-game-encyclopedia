Hello? WAKE UP!</p>\n<p>Ok, long story short. Bring your seven tokens to the goal first by rolling the four ancient dice. Each die can roll zero or one, where the white tip indicates one. All dice numbers get summed up after a roll.<br/></p>\n<p><em>\"But, umm, what if there is no white tip at all? Did I just rolled a zero?\"<br/></em></p>\n<p>Yes, you did!<em> </em>Bad for you, you're turn is wasted...</p>\n<p>Now you can move a token on the board with the rolled number. But watch out! Your enemy can kick you out on the red fields. Well, you can do that with your enemy, too.</p>\n<p>See, the fields with the die symbol?
