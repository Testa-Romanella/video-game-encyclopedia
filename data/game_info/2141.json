And it brought its friends to play in the dirt.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDriving and operating heavy machinery is a blast!<br/>\r\nTest your operating skills in this simulator game with a diverse set of challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUse the crane to load an unload, the bulldozer to shape the terrain, and an excavator to dig up the terrain.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSpeaking of terrain: it is the real hero in this game!<br/>\r\nWith never seen before dig-anywhere technology\u2122 you can shape the world.<br/>\r\nAny changes to the world will persist between levels and game sessions, and there are no restrictions: cliffs, overhangs, caves, tunnels: it is all possible.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe world size is near infinite: you can dig a hole, then drive for an hour in a random direction and backtrack by following your track impressions in the terrain.<br/>\r\nYou will then find your dug hole as you left it: no short-cuts: real terrain simulation!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game features 8 levels, and for each challenge you are given one or more vehicles to fulfill your mission. Each vehicle comes to life with quality physics simulations, and faithfully interacts with its environment.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6d3/6d3c870892f0d3bb377be244312139cc.jpeg", "website": "http://stolk.org/tlctc/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 5, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 261, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "iOS", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Game Studio Abraham Stolk", "Abraham Stolk"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing", "Educational", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Game Studio Abraham Stolk", "Abraham Stolk"], "esrb_rating": null}
