There isn't many features yet and it is really buggy, though I would appreciate it if you could try it and maybe tell me if there are bugs! If you have any suggestions or want to send a bug report, here is my email address: jamieschiantarelli@gmail.com. Currently there is only 1 map. More are coming soon! I will also iron out the bugs and add more features over the course of time. I am not working on this full time either, this is just a little project I started for fun.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>---Patch notes--</p>\n<p>Open alpha available!</p>\n<p>-Added basic gameplay.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-02-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92d/92dccb74c48095c89ee4b6400a0d10a0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NukularPotato"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
