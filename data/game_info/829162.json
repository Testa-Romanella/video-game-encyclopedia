The goal is to unlock all the items by leveling up. To level up you must vacuum an endless stream of items spawning around the map. You can make it easier to level up by upgrading your character and vacuum by selling items for money. Use the money to increase your speed, max spawnable items, and suction distance. There will be updates in the future, I would like to say this is the beta version of the game because it can always get better.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T08:18:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/306/30670d032cba297b72b0436249ad7e4b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 38, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["recklessdev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
