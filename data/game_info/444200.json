I am hoping to add more things in the future, but for now I will have to take things slow and steady as I have just learned the basics of Unity and a little bit of C#. IF people like this game, and would like to donate, I will use that money to upload CUBER to the Steam Page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-15T07:19:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/020/020e77c63c2bd2f319daf4651b69200a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["curtdavies621"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
