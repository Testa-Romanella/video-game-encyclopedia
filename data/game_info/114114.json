The game focuses on Yumi Mendez, the twenty-three year old protagonist, who moves home after graduating college to help take care of her Great Aunt Nena. Yumi\u2019s Aunt Nena grows sicker and becomes increasingly dependent and forgetful. The game follows Yumi\u2019s day-to-day life over the course of a summer placing the player in Yumi\u2019s perspective while she bathes Aunt Nena, cleans her room, shops, and messages her girlfriend. The game relies heavily on text and visuals to give players insight to Yumi\u2019s mood and emotions as they change over time. Our goal is for players to connect with the main character\u2019s depression and how everyday, seemingly easy or mundane tasks can contribute to changing emotional states. We wanted to address how these tasks can wear someone down.\u00a0</p><p>The game is comprised of four minigames that cycle through four times. Yumi\u2019s actions include bathing her Aunt Nena, cleaning her room, shopping at the store and avoiding her friend Brian, as well as texting her girlfriend in a long distance relationship. Between each \u201ccycle\u201d of the four minigames there is a transition showing Yumi\u2019s hair growing into a state of disarray accompanied by a triolet poem.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0d/e0de261904a0ebd03b03bf0e395e8013.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 72, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Marmishurenko"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
