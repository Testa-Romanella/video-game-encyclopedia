{"id": 914731, "slug": "rift-oclock", "name": "Rift O'Clock", "name_original": "Rift O'Clock", "description": "<p>There's a rift that comes from an alternate world that keeps dropping very aggresive squares... Most importantly, that rift has a peculiar property, which is that it runs on a timer that resets on each round.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>You can survive until the round ends... but killing enemies makes the round longer. And NOT killing won't give you money, so that way you'll become too weak and most likely perish in the long-run. The key of the game is balancing the killing, and the waiting-out-the-timer-while-dodging aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Considerations:</p>\n<ul><li>There are customizable options in the Main Menu and Pause Menu. If you are playing on your browser and can't go into Fullscreen, you can toggle that over there.</li><li>You can pause the game with Esc or P.</li><li>If you want to give feedback, consider recording yourself while playing, and post it in the comments! Text feedback is also usefull tho. Also, I'd appreciate it if you\u00a0rate and share the game if you liked it.</li></ul>\n<p><em>There are some secret badass techniques. Put those you can\u00a0find in the comments!
