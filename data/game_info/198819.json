I put a lot of love into this one. Your mission is to destroy an alien mothership and repel an all out invasion of Earth. No pressure!</p><p>Use arrow keys to move. Hold space to shoot.</p><p>Note: When you get a weapon powerup, and also when the powerup expires, you will have to let off and re-press Spacebar. There's also a 0.1 second cooldown before you can start firing again to prevent an exploit.</p><p>Your feedback is welcome. :)</p><p>Update 4-3-17: Made some changes to the asteroids to make that sequence shorter but a bit more challenging.</p><p>Enemy Damage Sound credit to AlienXXX @ Freesound.org</p><p>Boss Music credit to Ville Nousiainen http://soundcloud.com/mutkanto</p><p>Thanks to the Udemy course \"Learn to Code by Making Games\" for getting me started.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db29a5cc97d54655dd22730930e698d6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Linko"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
