She had a smile like the sunshine, but she looked sad at some points.<br/>Not only did Snow ask to live with me before the end of winter, she also asked to have unprotected sex with me on the first day we met. Claiming it was her first time and asking me to be gentle, she said she was on the pill...?<br/><br/><br/><br/>As we lived together and went on trips together, I slowly got to know Snow and became closer to her, but I could still feel that there were many things she did not want to tell me.<br/>She was fine with me doing all sorts of erotic things with her, but never said anything about her feelings for me.<br/>And what about me? What were my feelings for Snow?<br/><br/>When winter passed, would our relationship fade like melting snow, or could I try to make a change\u2026?<br/><br/><h3>\u25c6Gameplay Instructions</h3>During the days when you live with Snow, you can choose to \u201cWatch TV,\u201d \u201cChat with Snow,\u201d or \u201cGo out early in the morning\u201d (increase money) on the mornings of workdays.
