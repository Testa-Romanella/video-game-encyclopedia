The theme was \"Signal\"</p>\n<p><em>\"A world where robots have taken control over humans... A\u00a0world ruled by rhythm, where the only hope left is\u00a0<strong>the power of music</strong>\".</em></p>\n<p>In this game you find yourself on a street fight against a robot. Follow the rhythm until the end while defending from the robot's attacks to the beat in order to win the battle!<br/></p>\n<p>And remember...\u00a0<em><strong>always follow the beat</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>(For the best experience, do NOT play in full screen)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/></strong>F -&gt; Red circle (up)<br/>D -&gt; Blue circle (down)<br/>Space -&gt; White circle (wave area)</p>\n<p><strong>(Background and Idea)<br/></strong>When I first saw the jam banner with the wave going through the circle, I immediately thought of making a rhythm game set in a futuristic world where you get a \"wave signal\" when you have to press a button, but unfortunately due to time constraints I didn't manage to follow the theme properly. Still wanted to publish it though since it came out pretty well imo.<br/><br/><strong>Credits:<br/></strong>Characters sprites from\u00a0Free Townspeople Cyberpunk<br/>Level Track: Fresh - AlexiAction (Pixabay)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T05:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80f/80f5b7552f47ade545810ac32a3a4bfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["GalaxyVinci05"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
