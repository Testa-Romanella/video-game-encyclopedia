Use the insanity mechanic to your advantage to maximize damage and score! \u00a0</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Tribulation is an isometric shooter.\u00a0 There are 5 levels including one final boss fight.\u00a0 There are _two_ endings, a good and a bad.\u00a0 There are 3 enemies and 3 weapons. Player health is considered their \"sanity\" level.\u00a0 When sanity gets too low, the player is insane and may see things that do not exist in reality.\u00a0 Scores are calculated through a number of items such as enemies killed, times damaged, medkits collected, secrets found, and ending achieved.\u00a0 Weapons have different stats, some causing more \"stun\" damage than others.\u00a0 Stunning enemies causes them to be stopped temporarily and more vulnerable to damage.</p>\r\nTools used\r\nArt\r\n<p>- Aseprite</p>\r\nCode\r\n<p>- Godot 3.3</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>- [Strofe](strofe.com)</p>\r\nSFX\r\n<p>- [ChipTone](https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone)</p>\n<p>- Audacity</p>\r\nHosting\r\n<p>- Gitlab pages</p>\n<p>- Itch.io</p>\r\nContinuous Deployment\r\n<p>- Gitlab CI/CD</p>\r\nLeaderboard\r\n<p>- NodeJS</p>\n<p>- MongoDB</p>\n<p>- Digital Ocean App Platform</p>\r\nKnown Bugs (that will be fixed)\r\n<p>- Monsters may at times not attack more than once until they are hit or moved away from</p>\n<p>- Insanity at start of level may cause bugs with the world spawn</p>\n<p>- Bullets go through walls</p>\n<p>- Final boss may spawn monsters on top of eachother causing them to glitch</p>\n<p>- Insanity transition may cause player to get stuck in a wall (can kill yourself with X in this case)</p>\n<p>- Leaderboard submit button is offset wrong</p>\r\nCut Content\r\n<p>- Boss third phase <br/>\u00a0 - Insanity world in this phase would be filled with new area of effect items.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Boss would eat minions for additional health</p>\n<p>\u00a0 - Boss would have a clone in the Insanity world that is unkillable forcing the player to avoid</p>\n<p>- Spawner enemy to spawn new enemies on the map.
