Grief is a single player 2D platformer mechanically designed to personify the 5 stages of grief. The player is dropped in an occlusive and confusing world where they must use their powers of color to illuminate the puzzle and trap-ridden path of Grief. There are 5 levels, each with their own painting mechanic symbolic to its stage of grief and subsequent puzzles that utilize those mechanics. To succeed in each level, the player must harness the full power of understanding each paint; it\u2019s uses, and its detriments.\r\n  </p>\n<ul><li>\u201cDenial\u201d \u2013 Green paint that simply illuminates the path.\r\n  </li><li>\u201cAnger\u201d \u2013 Red paint that kills enemies and hurts the player\r\n  </li><li>\u201cBargaining\u201d \u2013 Blue paint that causes the player to bounce trading force for height.
