She has seen me playing games and always wants to join in. But handling a controller and such is tough for a 3 year old and I\u00a0don't have a lot of games that are\u00a0<em>friendly</em> enough for her to learn on.</p>\n<p>That brings us to this game. It's really meant to do two things:</p>\n<ol><li>\u00a0Help her learn how games &amp; controllers work so I can selfishly have a co-op game buddy</li><li>Show her that she can make games herself as she grows up</li></ol>\n<p>Emma has been playing the game at just about every update. Sitting on my lap at my workstation and telling me the stuff she likes, making sound effects for her own jumps, and dutifully drawing her own maps in the map editor.</p>\n<p>If you have a young child who's in a similar spot, I'd recommend picking up some game making software and working on something with them! As a second option though, maybe <em>Emma's Secret Mission</em>\u00a0will suffice for point 1 at least. You can always use the map editor I did\u00a0Tiled Map Editor to create your own maps in <em>Emma's Secret Mission</em> as well.
