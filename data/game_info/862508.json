Theme was \"Every 10 seconds\".</p>\n<p>My comment on LDJAM 04.10.2022:</p>\n<p><em>It is my first game ever actually (with a beginning and an end that is). I did everything by myself and from scratch (except the glass cracking sound, but that was public domain). Totally forgot to add some insights. These 3 days were tough. Don\u2019t got the full 72 hours because of important privat stuff. Hated the theme\u2026 Was nervous the whole time\u2026 Boy oh boy. But I learned a lot! And I\u2019m glad I made it in the end.</em><br/></p>\n<p>v1.1</p>\n\n<p>- Made control instructions in room 1 clearer</p>\n<p>- Fixed some capitalization errors in texts</p>\n<p>- Moved player in room 1 so you need to move to the exit and don't stand on top of it</p>\n<p>- Made the timer start in the rooms without enemies properly</p>\n<p>- Removed spaces between barriers in room 3 so you can't shoot through them anymore</p>\n<p>- Made the text on last screen faster</p>\n<p>- Added in room 8 the proper barriers</p>\n<p>- Made the music on title screen start faster</p>\n<p>- Fixed a bug where it was possible to die even after touching the exit</p>\n<p>Please rate and comment here:</p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/deep-dive-1<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T14:35:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/498/498d1d2de7d2cd061068399cd85eecb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["OakhardtDev"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
