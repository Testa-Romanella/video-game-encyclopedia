{"id": 773703, "slug": "21xx-prime-speedster-ex", "name": "21XX Prime Speedster EX", "name_original": "21XX Prime Speedster EX", "description": "<p><strong>~~STORY~~</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Previously, on \"The wastes\u00a0are a hellhole\":</p>\n<p>\"This desert sucks, and your friends at the other side of this wasteland asked if you could run a few cold ones over. They just\u00a0<em>had</em>\u00a0to ask right before one of the largest duststorms since 21XX, but you're cool with it. Your shitty Debulon Model S speedster can easily beat this storm, provided its engine doesn't fall out. But hey, no biggie, right? She's been through worse than a few cacti, some hills, a few rolling stones, and a freakin space laser. Worse yet, the Debulon wasn't built for longer distances, it was mostly built for drag races, so refueling is a must.\u00a0Goddamnit, you don't even know if this beer is gonna be cold by the time you get there.\"\u00a0-\u00a0<em>21XX Prime\u00a0Speedster</em></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you came with the non-name brand stuff last time. For shame! This time, at least make the journey worth the effort and grab some of that good stuff in the back.</p>\n<p>That's right, the journey for pisswater goes on once more! This time without the need for a controller that was outlawed in 207X.</p>\n<p><strong>~~EPILEPSY WARNING~~</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This game's got more flashing lights than the recommended amount from the Surgeon General. If you have concerns over such things, you can turn them off under \"Accessibility\" in the options menu.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>~~CONTROLS~~</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS - </strong>Navigates menus and turns your car. Pretty important all things considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Z, X, C, and V KEYS -\u00a0</strong>Controls the speed of your engine, from completely off to regular speed. Good for maneuvering around small clusters of obstacles.</p>\n<p><strong>SPACEBAR\u00a0</strong>- The boost button, sends you hurtling forward a much higher speed than normal. Good for getting points and goin' fast.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>A and D KEY -\u00a0</strong>Banks your car left and right. These actually physically move the car, so they're good if you see a lot of obstacles on one side or a giant laser coming at you.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>R\u00a0KEY\u00a0</strong>- Resets the level, bringing you back to the start and your wheels back to an unfucked state.<br/></p>\n<p>Don't fall in love with this layout, since you can always rebind it in the options menu.</p>\n<p><strong>~~MECHANICS~~</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Compass -\u00a0</strong>The thing in the bottom right. The lower side tells you the distance to the next station, and the topside tells you if you're on track to get there. If the compass arrow turns grey, you're not making any progress to the next station.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Glance</strong> - This is as close as I can get to the name since this game\u00a0isn't a bullet hell. Get close to obstacles without hitting them and\u00a0your ship will shoot off some particles to indicate you've avoided it. In the regular mode, these give you a bit of health back, but on the harder difficulty, it instead gives you points. Go for the highscore!\u00a0Or something.</p>\n<p><strong>Duststorm</strong> - It can never be easy, can it? A vicious storm is following you the whole time, so you can't be too slow in your travels. Using the boost or putting your engine to full speed usually helps to shake it.<br/></p>\n<p>That's about it, the download's below. Hope you enjoy and have as much fun playing this game as I\u00a0did making it.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T16:18:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/433/4338c3833a16415d630ba5e722605f96.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wobbled"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
