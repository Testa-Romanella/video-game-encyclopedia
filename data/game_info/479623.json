But if you could give feedback about the parts that do work that would be excellent!! Thanks for your interest!</p>\n<p>My first game-jam submission! I am still not quite sure why I spent 5 days working on a platformer controller and then not used it but we don't talk about that...<br/></p>\n<p>Feeling blue? is a game about dodging BSODs, you play as a derpily animated robot boi with magical arms and legs, is this strange yet?</p>\n<p>At will, you can rewind (get it) to a previous state you left your body in, called clones. You can have three clones and once they are gone, unfortunately they are gone for good, so try not to fall in the lava pit!</p>\n<p>Found any bugs? I want to continue development for\u00a0this game after the jam, so any feedback is extremely valuable!</p>\n<p>Bug Found: game over won't trigger if the mouse is spammed while the final clone falls into the lava\u00a0 fixed (hopefully)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-10T11:28:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b16/b16f15a796168a58cfff99b8c4043ed2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 40, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Tobyrcod"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
