Is this work-under-construction a vicious attack or a bluff?<br/>Should I expect a risky move from my opponent or assume he's as afraid of me as I am of him?<br/>Psychological warfare plays a big role in Keep the Keep!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T02:09:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2f/f2f9c775a0f419bf9e80f94e323690ec.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Nebulate.me"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie", "Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nebulate.me"], "esrb_rating": null}
