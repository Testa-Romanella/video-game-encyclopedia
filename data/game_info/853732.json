Thus, I am calling this version of the game Cherry Bomb V2, but credit for 90% of the assets (including sprites, music, and code) goes to the people who contributed to the tutorial's version of the game.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes I made include:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>I added 2 new bosses, for a total of 3 (1 every 3 waves).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The bosses now have dialog and drop cherries when changing phases, giving you an opportunity to heal or use cherry bombs against them.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The laser shoots automatically so you don't have to hold down a button the whole time. This allows you to better focus on aiming, dodging, collecting cherries, and shooting cherry bombs.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You get a 1-up and points for completing each wave.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Cherries leftover at the end of the game give points.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The player has two different hitboxes now: a small one for colliding with enemies and enemy bullets, and a large one for colliding with cherry pickups.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I designed some original waves for this version of the game.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I added stats to the end screen.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The stars turn into lines when changing waves so it looks like you're flying really quickly. Also, the stars move faster as the game goes on.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The player ship is larger, and the game runs at 60 FPS instead of 30, so I had to balance the timing and spacing of things to accommodate these changes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I gave the player ship a small acceleration/deceleration when moving. Also, it accelerates slower when \"speeding up\" (moving up the screen) and faster when \"slowing down\" (moving down the screen), with changes to the ship's flame to reflect this.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I added some new frames to the turning animation for the ship, making it look smoother.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I changed the draw order of some elements for visual clarity.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I modified assets from the tutorial to match a red/blue/yellow color palette with a flat-shaded style.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>I added some other small visual effects, like fading, health bars, text that drops in/flies away, etc.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-19T13:23:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/103/1039d55b1e7900113cda40a9fa9bd33f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["beekins"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
