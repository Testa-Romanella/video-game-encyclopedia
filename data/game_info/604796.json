So the goal is to collect as many coins as possible for points whilst using guns as little as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Click right mouse button for thrust towards the mouse pointer. Left mouse button to fire. 'W' to change color.\u00a0</p><p>When blue, only blue lasers harm you and only collisions with blue enemies hurt you. When red, only red lasers harm you and only collisions with red enemies hurt you. But your lasers are the same - only your red lasers can hurt red enemies and only blue lasers hurt blue enemies.</p><p>TIPS: The goal is to collect coins (5 points). Each time you fire lasers, you lose 1 point. So - as only the same color enemies hurt you, the first wave you can just fly through and collect the coins. The second wave - change color and fly through. Then from there it gets harder (balance color, movement and dodging)</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Music: FoxSynergy</p>\n<p>Sound effects: Viktor.Hahn@web.de, Kenney.nl<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-17T07:13:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/714/71498a1e4bf44d97a34051ff635938b7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["v_da5id"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
