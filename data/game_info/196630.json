One of them is coming for you, but you don't know which.\u00a0Find a gun, find a bullet, and race against the clock to escape! The game has a focus on atmosphere, with an original dynamic soundtrack and disorientating visual style.</p>\n<p>It's also my first ever published game, so sorry in advance that it burned your eyes/melted your cpu/keyed your car/was boring.</p>\n<p>A handful of assets were used in the creation of this entry:</p>\n<p>sound assets (footsteps, radiostatic,gunshot)</p>\n<p>Visual assets\u00a0(npc, pistol, chest)</p>\n<p>Scripting assets\u00a0(headtracking script)</p>\n\n<p>Music, procedural level design, game mechanics, concept and bugs are all my own doing!</p>\n\n<p>It's 5am where I am now, so proper description is probably to follow.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/296/296a818d93c2b10a0455fd99c06cde01.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Scruffiest_Bear"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
