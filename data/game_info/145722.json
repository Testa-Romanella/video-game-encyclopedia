You start with 1 minute on the timer, and you need to score as many points as you can before your time runs out. You can increase your time by destroying blocks and clearing platforms.\r\n</p>Time Trial Challenges<p>\r\n\tWhen you collect a Jackpot letter in the story mode for the first time, a new time trial challenge will be unlocked. This challenge is a more difficult version of the mini-game/boss.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dd0/dd02eb1dc3be75c666c9aef76d427ec1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": [], "developers": ["Neonchimp"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
