The bravest warrior was chosen to explore a distant galaxy. Everything looked good at first, but shortly before reaching the surface of the first distant planet, strange-looking and not very nice monsters attack him.</p>\n<p>Will he still manage to reach the alien planet?\u00a0</p>\n\r\nControls:\r\n<p>The game is controlled by using the steering cross and the x button. Nothing else is needed.</p>\n<p>In further levels there appear some power ups that can be selected from the fighter. Some things like a safety shield or a turbo gun. I don't want to give everything away, so this must be enough at this point. \u00a0;-)</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you like my game or if you don't like it ...</strong></p>\n<p>I would be happy, if you share your opinion about it in the comments. Maybe I can improve the game or I will take over your comments for my next project. \u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-24T07:09:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef0/ef012da1e35ad3264dd9e90eb9e0ec26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Moggi-Synth"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
