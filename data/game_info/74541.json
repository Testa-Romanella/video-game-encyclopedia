What about a Virtual Reality version?<br/><br/>You have to solve this maze and killed zombies and go to next.<br/>A Maze Walk VR takes maze solving to a whole new level by utilizing the gyroscope on your mobile device, so that you can physically walk in both the real and the in the virtual world simultaneously (or if you prefer just jiggle your hands to mimic walking movement). For a more immersive experience, load your phone into a VR headset / Glasses / Goggles and trick your mind that you are really there!<br/><br/><br/>Exploration in virtual reality is available using Google Cardboard on iPhone. Google Cardboard only works with iPhone 5 and later, running iOS 8 or later.<br/><br/>Known Issue: app crashes when trying to change cardboard viewer on iOS 10. We'll update the app soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-27T01:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e46/e46b3cae1bd4bf1c2decc70a23aa64eb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 264, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["kishan chapani"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "publishers": ["kishan chapani"], "esrb_rating": null}
