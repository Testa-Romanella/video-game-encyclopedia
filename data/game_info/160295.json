Each Prototype explores mechanics following the themes of lights, camera, sound and 3D space. The purpose of these small prototypes is to explore how mechanics may be used in a final version, which is likely to come down the line. Though a narrative exists to a degree for the prototypes, they are rather basic as opposed to the larger ongoing project to come.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/67b/67bdce5cf1213b507e56bd0fe38772e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 194, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Rainy Grotto"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
