Coining the phrase; \u201cRun. Gun. Dumb. Fun.\u201d, Modular Squared believes games should be light on story and heavy in action! <br/>Their debut game; \u201cLast Stands\u201d is a first-person-shooter game in which scores are based on survival rate and enemy kill count. The aim of the game is good old fashioned, crazy \u201cpew-pew\u201d fun. Players can choose from a range of guns in an atmospheric city-setting, and find themselves surrounded by enemies in this apocalyptic, chaotic, nostalgic game. <br/>Created with casual gamers in mind (we\u2019re looking at you, parents and nine-to-fivers), \u201cLast Stands\u201d is a perfect pick-up-and-play game, but there may be a couple of hidden gems for those hardcore gamers too. <br/>It is clear that a lot of hard work, dedication, and multiple caffeine fixes went into this game, but what Modular Squared most enjoyed about developing \u201cLast Stands\u201d was the opportunity to work with their family and teach their kids about the world of video games. <br/>The Demo of \u201cLast Stands\u201d is available now! <br/>Follow Modular Squared for the latest \u201cLast Stands\u201d news: <br/>Twitter @Modular_Squared<br/>Modular Squared.
