Attempt to outsmart your oponnent by forcing them to run their pawns into inevitable doom.</p><p>The game is pretty simplistic as of know and holds little actuall game value, more as an exercise to me and fullfiling a dream of young me.\u00a0</p><p>I hope anyone can find some fun in this Project, i will add some more content to the game and will add a proper Gameplayloop to it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:21:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2e3/2e3b95c7bc032ad03f6e016f6205a494.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IMaser"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
