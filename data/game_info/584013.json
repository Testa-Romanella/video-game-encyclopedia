But danger lurks around every corner and try to kill you, you need to find food and water, manage your inventory and fight monsters, avoid traps\u00a0to stay alive.\r\n</p>\n<p>Some tips:\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Drop unused item to mark the road ( no mini-map here)\r\n</p>\n<p>-Rest to recovery Health and Stamina\r\n</p>\n<p>-Blocking enemy's attack or run from them\u00a0when you needed it\r\n</p>\n<p>-Don't get hungry and thirsty\u00a0\r\n</p>\n<p>-Play\u00a0slowly and be careful, death mean game-over.\r\n</p>\n<p>If you finished this game, please post screenshots or stream it on youtube, it'll make me very happy.
