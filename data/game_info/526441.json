The project\u2019s Github URL is: https://github.com/pc9795/moonshot</p>\n<p>You have to land a Rocket on Moon fighting against gravity, bouncing off asteroids and destroying/avoiding obstacles. This game gives a player three abilities: Bullets, Dropships, and Boosts. Bullets are used to destroy certain destructible objects; Dropships are used to control your speed mid-air and Boosts are to increase your speed.   </p>\n<p>There are no difficulty settings right now but I consider this game to be between normal to hard difficulty. As Rocket will have no velocity and it will depend on the initial launch velocity and the mid-air boosts, it's all about timing.   </p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this game.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:59:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/78d/78db028c74615ed473878af35c56d96d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["pc9795"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
