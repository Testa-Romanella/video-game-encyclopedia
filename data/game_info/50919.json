You play as Kelsey, remembering Marie&#39;s room as it was 20 years ago. What happened to Marie and Kelsey all those years ago?<br />\n\u201cIt was supposed to be simple. Get in, get out. I should have known better.\u201d<br />\nKelsey arrives in a seemingly empty room. She has only one goal, one purpose there -- getting Marie\u2019s journal. But the room is not empty at all. In fact, it\u2019s filled to the brim with memories, memories from 20 years ago, some of them which Kelsey would rather forget. Some of them, she cherishes to this day.<br />\nJoin Kelsey in her trip down memory lane and uncover Marie and Kelsey\u2019s past by exploring Marie\u2019s room as it was all those years ago, or at least, how Kelsey remembers it.<br />\nExplore their stories, linked to every object in the room. Open drawers and search Marie\u2019s laptop for clues. Find out what secrets the room holds.<br />\n\u201cShe once asked me, you know: \u2018Don&#39;t you ever dream, Kelsey?\u2019 And I said I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t dream, I plan. What I didn&#39;t tell her, was that I would not allow anyone to mess with those plans.\u201d</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-06T18:37:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c98/c98b6bad7444fc89b2ef9f9ded641c9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 3.37, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 50, "owned": 663, "beaten": 118, "toplay": 24, "dropped": 8}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 7, "ratings_count": 114, "suggestions_count": 228, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 115, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Kenny Guillaume"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Kenny Guillaume"], "esrb_rating": null}
