It purpose was to find and classify life all around the galaxy. Project was divided into two major sections: Probes and Facilities. Probes were self-replicating robots with semi-intelligent program. Their task was to swarm entire galaxy and send all possible information to the Facilities. Facilities were collecting and storing all gathered information. One of them due to unfortunate coincidence was damaged resulting in memory corruptions. Personality stored there was also corrupted. Semi-AI decided to put Personality on standby and wake it up only when it would be needed.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/419/4193c7d52487e5ab1537fa90bb0eb759.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Aki"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
