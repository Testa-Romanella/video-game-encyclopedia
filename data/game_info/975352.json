There are sharks in the way, which the ships must avoid. Controlling the movements of the boats is on the keyboard using the WASD keys. The sharks are controlled automatically by the computer, but can also be controlled by the other player using the arrow keys on the keyboard. When the time limit expires, the game ends. There is one point for each ship transported to the destination. Each ship destroyed by a shark is also one point. The winner is the side that scores the most points overall.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat was the inspiration for this game? From February to October 2023, Pa\u0159ansk\u00fd r\u00e1j, under the mascot Marushka, led a project to translate the games through artificial intelligence. It translated a total of 45 games into English. As a thank you for your support during that period, this game was created.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2024-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-19T06:07:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/460/46067997714fcd0d7e36d8083668b609.jpg", "website": "https://www.paranskyraj.cz/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pa\u0159ansk\u00fd r\u00e1j"], "genres": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pa\u0159ansk\u00fd r\u00e1j"], "esrb_rating": null}
