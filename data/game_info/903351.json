One of the reasons this game is nostalgic for me, is an event that happened in high school (early 80's):</p>\r\nA friend of mine had a birthday party sleepover. I stayed up all night playing Missile Command on his\u00a0Atari 2600, even after everyone else went to bed. I played so long, and so intently that after I finally went home and lay down to sleep, Missile Command was so burnt into my eyes and brain that it played on my closed eyelids.\r\n<p>I apologize for the lack of sound but I couldn't find any good sound files that I knew I could legally use. (iow, I could find good sound files, just not legal for me to use this way.) I didn't make my own or use generic sound files as I found wrong sounds more jaring to the nostalgia-trip than no sound.<br/></p>\n<p>I made everything but\u00a0the font. That was created by 'Cody \"CodeMan38\" Boisclair' and used under the \"SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1\".</p>\n<p>I used DragonRuby 4.0, gVim 8.2, and Gimp 2.10.32 to create the game.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T07:35:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/797b88cb66c0386ce98a19cf26ee47df.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Vlevo"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
