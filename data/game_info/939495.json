She lived in Chicago for a long time before moving to a rural community a few hours outside Jacksonville, Florida. There she and my uncle have a homestead where they focus on growing her own food, living sustainability, and contributing to her community. Spending winters there has inspired me to start a garden, take up knitting, and get to know my neighbors a little better. One major takeaway I had from my last visit was that people in their community are constantly bringing each other fruit they have harvested, or teaching their neighbors how to save seeds, or bringing wood to someone that they know likes to carve bowls. We decided that we wanted our game to reflect this communal aspect, so our game is a cooperative game where players act as neighbors to create a sustainable town. \"</em>\r\nYou and your friends have decided to leave your big city lives behind and move out to the country.
