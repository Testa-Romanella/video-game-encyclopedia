His magic wand has fled; his potions lay smashed on the ground! Razmatazz is left with just his favorite gaming dice, left in the pocket of his oldest, most threadbare robe. Use the dice to defeat the possessed items in this turn-based dungeon crawler!</p>\n<p>WASD moves our dumpy little wizard. Beware, when you move, the enemies move too!<br/></p>\n<p>On the right, you'll see the contents of his pocket! Click and drag a die out of the pocket and onto a monster to attack using the power of shiny math rocks!</p>\n<p>Be careful, Razmatazz is old and fragile! He only has so many hit dice before it's game over!</p><p>Note: We were not able to implement any game over detection, so when you're out of health or all the enemies are dead, the game is over!<br/></p><p>Credits:<br/>Cloud Puppy Games feat Warren Corkscrew<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T21:26:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3fb/3fb9d0412a4540b89cc3f6d644811289.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Cmdr3nder", "dreamsprite"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
