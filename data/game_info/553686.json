Now you'll have to regrow them. Need more vegetable plots? Then get to making soil.<br/><br/>Get ready to bring life to the Forest Farm and make it a thriving ecosystem.<br/><br/>Every plant in the game can be grown from seed, harvested and even replanted.<br/><br/>Every plot can be moved to your desired location and this is saved automatically.<br/><br/>There will be multiple activities to master, from growing vegetables, to logging and clearing the forest, to fishing at the river.<br/><br/>Each of these will mimic the activities on an actual Forest Farm and I hope it is something different for the gaming community.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-05T06:32:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/dc5/dc5c0c420b3736a19bd2f3015334cfa3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 142, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tonicgamesaustralia"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
