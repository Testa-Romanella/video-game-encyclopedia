I used GBStudio 2 and bits of Jeremy Oduber's fonts. \u00a0My partner Caidence made the music. \u00a0All the source material is available on GitHub.\u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Enjoy!<br/></p>\r\n\u2697\ufe0f\r\n<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>1. The human encounter is still occasionally not working on.<br/>2. The ending sequence is missing an animation, and in general could use a little work.<br/>3. There should be a mute button for the music, in case you want to play in a chill way.<br/>4. The wind in the tower is a bit glitchy.\u00a0 Rarely, <em>you can get stuck in the wall</em>.<br/>5. The movement physics could stand some additional adjustment.<br/>6. Sound effects to indicate an ouchie would be helpful!<br/>7. Sound effects to indicate jumping would be helpful! (I'm not sure if this can be done with the current engine?)<br/>8. Warnings to do with the music files are emitted during build, but the music seems to play fine....<br/>9. Selecting from the pause menu while in front of an NPC will cause the NPC dialogue to happen before invoking the menu item. (This is an engine issue: https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/issues/468 , but maybe we can work around it?)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-07T06:07:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d82/d82cff7a6342b0d37daf516f7c633a8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 174, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MxAshlynn"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
