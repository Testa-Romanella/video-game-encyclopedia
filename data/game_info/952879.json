(You can refer to the official Sideloading Playdate games documentation.)</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t own a Playdate, you can play in the Playdate Simulator on <strong>Windows, macOS or Linux</strong>. Download and install the Playdate SDK. Place the .pdx file in the PlaydateSDK/Disk/Games/ folder. (The .pdx available for download has been compiled on macOS. If you play on another system, you\u2019ll need to recompile the game. The source code is available on GitHub.)<br/></p>\r\nChanges\r\n<p><em>Celeste Classic on Playdate</em> was made to be as faithful as possible to the original game on PICO-8. But here are a few notable changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The game is in <strong>black and white</strong> only. A lot of visual elements have an outline to make them more readable. But this does not impact their original hitbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The game is rendered at <strong>256\u00d7240</strong> from the original 128\u00d7128. Four pixel lines are cropped at the top and bottom of the screen. The game can be played at its original resolution by disabling the <em>Fullscreen</em> option available in the game\u2019s menu.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Assist mode</strong> is available under the game\u2019s menu. This allows players to skip a level, change the game speed to 0.5\u00d7, get infinite dashes, and enable invincibility. If assist mode is used during a run, a mention is added on each level in the lower right corner, as well as in the pause screen and the final score screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Celeste Classic is an original game on PICO-8 by Noel Berry and Maddy Thorson.</p>\n<p>PICO-8 and the PICO-8 font are the property of Lexaloffle Games.</p>\n<p>Playdate is a registered trademark of Panic.</p>\n<p>The Playdate port was done by R\u00e9mi Parmentier.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Alex Larioza for help and tips on performance optimizations.
