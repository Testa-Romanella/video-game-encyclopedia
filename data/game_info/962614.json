The protagonist of the game is an elderly blogger named Bill Board. Today is Saturday and the grandson came to visit Bill. Bill and his grandson decided to fry potatoes for lunch, but there were too many potatoes, so they decided to treat people on the street, and at the same time stream. True, not everyone likes fried potatoes, which means they can attack you, so sometimes you have to defend yourself. For protection, you can use both an ordinary banana and a real weapon. All this can be bought in the store.<br/><br/>The player's task is to treat as many people as possible with fried potatoes. If you don\u2019t want to do this, then the game has a sandbox mode where you can just walk around the city and play a joke on people. The main thing to remember is that if you break the law a lot, the police will start looking for you.<br/><br/>Help Bill feed as many people in the town as possible and stay alive.<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-06-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-23T04:44:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cc2/cc298dc57c4832b14999b379958dc90d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 379, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Foxi"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation", "Racing", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Foxi"], "esrb_rating": null}
