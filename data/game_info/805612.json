Your goal is to use your space-age lasso to traverse the levels and combat space-age android cows.</p>\n<p>The cows' AI routines are on the fritz and they are not friendly. The combat is tough, and your lasso can't influence the cows directly. Make connections between the cows and the environment to cause some damage. Checkpointing is very liberal. You won't need to repeat any combat encounters unless you go back through the level.\u00a0</p>\r\nTips\r\n<p>If the combat is more challenging than you like, you can adjust your starting\u00a0health using up/down arrow keys at any time.\u00a0</p>\r\nPlatforms:<p>Windows</p>\r\nCredits:\r\n<p>All code and art by me.</p>\n<p>Music from\u00a0Cowboy Glitch (borja vs. go1dfish) by spinningmerkaba (c) copyright 2011 Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (3.0) license. http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/jlbrock44/33623 Ft: borja, go1dfish</p>\n<p>Sounds from https://freesound.org/\u00a0including:</p>\n<ul><li>https://freesound.org/people/alanmcki/sounds/461017/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/RunnerPack/sounds/87040/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/JoelAudio/sounds/135459/</li><li>https://freesound.org/people/JoelAudio/sounds/135452/</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-20T16:42:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/731/7316fd02fe77384ab5a71b7b496e085e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Infinite_relic"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
