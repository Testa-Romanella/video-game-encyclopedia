Without energy, how will we defend ourselves? No longer able to look at screens all day, the humans put out a desperate cry for help.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the <em>Windup Wizards</em> arrived. They don\u2019t need electricity. They don\u2019t need power. You just wind them up, building and building energy, until you decide to <em>release</em> it.\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Hopefully, they can turn the tide against this powerful invasion of <em>Blackout Bunnies</em>.\r\n  \u00a0 <br/></p>\n<p>Remark: although the game is perfectly playable online, I always recommend <em>downloading</em> the executable of the game for the best experience.<br/></p>\r\nHow to play?\r\n<p>You are a magical gust of wind. You can fly in any direction (until something stops you).\r\n  \u00a0\r\n  </p>\n<p>Flying past a knob rotates it that way, winding up whatever it belongs to, building their energy.\r\n  </p>\n<p>Flying <em>into</em> something unwinds it and makes them execute their actions! (Exactly\u00a0as many\u00a0times\u00a0as\u00a0they were wound up.)</p>\n<p>Some buttons which are not taught in-game, but might be useful to you, are <br/></p>\n<ul><li>WASD for movement also works</li><li>Q and E for rotating the camera</li></ul>\r\nBut how do I win?\r\n<p> Whenever a Wizard meets an Bunny, they remove it. Remove all to win!<br/></p>\n<p>(The first few levels start without wizards and other rules, to make the introduction of game mechanics easier.)<br/></p>\n\r\nWhat to expect?\r\n<p>Windup Wizards is a</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Casual puzzle game</strong></li><li>Playable on <strong>Desktop and Mobile</strong> (using keyboard, controller, or mouse/touch)</li><li>With <strong>9 worlds</strong> containing <strong>5-10 levels each.<br/></strong></li><li>Without an upfront tutorial, as new mechanics are gradually introduced as you go</li><li>With a unique mechanic (winding up and releasing) ...</li><li>... and many wizardy hats flopping around making bunnies disappear</li></ul>\r\nGoGodot Jam 2\r\n<p>This game was made for the GoGodot Jam 2. The theme was <strong>Energy Source</strong>, which ultimately defined the whole game from start to finish. (All creatures are an energy source that needs to be wound up to store energy, the unwound to release it and use it.)<br/></p>\n<p>That means content and polish is limited, although my experience with puzzle games allowed me to go quite far in such a short time. Still, any <strong>feedback</strong> is more than welcome!<br/></p>\n<p>It's designed using Godot (surprising, I know). Everything is custom made by me (idea, code, models, sound, ...)</p>\n<p>I've written a devlog about the whole process: Windup Wizards (Devlog)<br/></p>\n<p><em>The game file size is quite big for a simple puzzle game, isn't it?</em> Well, yeah, not sure what that's about. The game <em>does</em> have tons of content and high-resolution images, but this is absurd. Probably some setting or resource thing I don't know about.<br/></p>\r\nIs it done?\r\n<p>Some worlds were conceived (and partially made), that didn't make it into the final game because of the time limit. As such, the game will receive those 3-5 extra worlds once voting for the jam ends.</p>\n<p>That same time limit prevented me from really polishing the game, adding particles, varied backgrounds, etcetera. With that final update, this will see some improvements as well.</p>\n<p>By all other accounts, the game is polished, filled with content, and done!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:28:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b10/b109226ba2e591bbbdddaaabdd048c82.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 71, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["Pandaqi"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
