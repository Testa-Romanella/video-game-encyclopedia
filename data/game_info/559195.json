Here\u2019s your chance to run Soda World \u2013 where soda literally sends people flying through the air. <br/><br/>Cherry, Peach, Lemon Soda \u2013 Yum! But Cactus or Chili Soda???  Hold the mustard (soda) if you must, but keep producing! Running a soda company can be fun \u2013 and a bit strange at times \u2013 but it literally pays to give the customers what they want.  <br/><br/>Fill those soda bottles, expand your warehouse, upgrade vending machines, and enjoy a few celebrations along the way, because the more wishes you fulfill and the more soda you produce, the more you\u2019ll be able to expand into exotic lands such as China, Japan, Egypt and the United Kingdom.  And did we mention your soda will be delivered by flying saucers? <br/><br/>Facebook: SoulGameFans", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-19T04:57:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db6/db67a1c01154432d2544159e7431a7d5_GeqL8wS.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/SoulGameFans", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 126, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["SOULGAME INFORMATION CO"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["SOULGAME INFORMATION CO"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
