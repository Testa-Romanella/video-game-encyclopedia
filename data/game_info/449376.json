My name is <strong>Nick Oztok\u00a0</strong>and I'm the creator, developer, and programmer\u00a0of\u00a0<strong>Aurascope.</strong> It's an original indie platformer that I'm making with my best friend\u00a0<strong>Jonah Worley</strong>\u00a0under our company\u00a0<strong>Brobro Studios</strong>!</p><p>\u00a0 \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>While the game mainly is a <strong>platformer</strong>, there's so many\u00a0different\u00a0elements from various genres\u00a0that contribute to it being so much more than your\u00a0typical platformer. For instance we emphasize a lot on <strong>collecting goodies and exploration</strong>, as well as including elements from <strong>adventure, puzzle, </strong>and even<strong> RPG</strong> games! It's really meant to be a blend of many different\u00a0genres so there's something for everyone to enjoy.<br/></p>\n<p>This game is still in very early development,\u00a0but there is one short demo to try out to really get an idea of what\u00a0<strong>Aurascope</strong> is all about! While there's still a bunch to do we do try to showcase progress frequently though! <strong>We mostly showcase updates on weekends\u00a0</strong>on our <strong>Twitter</strong> and we'll try to be active here too!\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>Check out the Discord Server and join the Aurascope community!<br/>Also follow Aurascope's social medias for general updates too!</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/><br/></p>\r\nStory:\r\n<p><strong>COMING SOON!</strong>\u00a0While we have it finished we want to properly show it off once it's completed in-game fitted with proper visuals and music. We'll at least share this little snippet with you below along with this beautiful artwork made by incredibly talented\u00a0<strong>Andrea</strong>!<br/><br/></p>\n<p><em>Trace and his best friend Aurora arrived at the beautiful <strong>Starstone Forest</strong>\u00a0walking through the lush golden grass pondering at<strong>\u00a0</strong>what caused the mysterious energy burst.</em></p>\n\n<br/>Gameplay:\r\n<p>In Aurascope you mainly play as a guy named\u00a0<strong>Trace </strong>and\u00a0collect <strong>Energy Cores</strong> scattered throughout the lands\u00a0to restore the knocked out power to\u00a0the many worlds in the\u00a0<strong>Islands of Skylight</strong>. Using your metallic arms and your\u00a0<strong>Aurascope</strong> you can manipulate objects emitting\u00a0<strong>Aura Energy</strong>. Mainly things like\u00a0<strong>Aurastones</strong>, basically blocks that can have many different attributes and abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For instance you can use <strong>Regular Aurastones</strong> to help reach new ground!</p>\n<p>Or maybe use a\u00a0<strong>Bomb Stone\u00a0</strong>to clear up some rocks blocking your path!<br/><br/></p>\n<p>That's not all though.<strong> Trace is a lean, mean, jumping machine</strong> with an array of moves at his disposal! He's definitely quite the acrobat using moves like his<strong> roll, diving leap, walljump, and more</strong> he can really get around just about anywhere!\u00a0<em>Perfect for speedrunning!</em></p>\n<p>\n<br/></p>\n<p>Smash pots, collect goodies, and when implemented, you'll be able to\u00a0level up Trace by\u00a0collecting XP from collecting Energy Cores, nabbing Star Reactors, defeating baddies, and beating challenges/missions\u00a0to increase his\u00a0<strong>health, ???????, attack, or defense</strong>! What is\u00a0<strong>???????\u00a0</strong>you may ask? We'll reveal that later on when we can properly show it off!<br/></p>\n<p>For now we hope you'll be looking forward to\u00a0<strong>Aurascope\u00a0</strong>in the future. I'm putting all my heart, passion, and soul into this game to really make it something memorable and enjoyable.\u00a0<strong>Stay tuned!</strong>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:57:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e1/8e1306758bc3b2170979b546f5a00107.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 412, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nick64\u2605"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
