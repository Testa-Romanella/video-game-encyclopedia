I tried to make different levels, so they would be intresting. Game is pretty short, my goal wasnt be like \"Make 3000+ levels match-3 game\", more like \"Learn basics of coding and finish your first project\". And im kinda happy with it, its look finished.</p>\n<p>This is my 1st ever full game.\u00a0\u00a0Almost full :)</p>\n<p>Made in Godot Engine, which I still love very much, but had to move on to Unity. I was working on this project about 3 months, tried to learn how to code and to draw things, it was pretty challenging. Followed by the guide of Mr Taft Creates first, but then decided to go my way. I implemended so many things in the code all by myself, i was so happy about it. It looks pretty finished game, no bugs and such.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-23T05:45:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8f6/8f6b8c276e1e358e4216baa5e9f28b94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 82, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["PurpleSphynx"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
