A tank, or maybe a monster truck? What\u2019s it like outside? <br/>Oh, it\u2019s the North Pole. Then a snowmobile will do just fine!<br/> <br/>That\u2019s basically what our game is all about. It may sound easy but, trust me\u2026 It\u2019s not :) <br/>It\u2019s a matter of reflex and observation skills. So if you don\u2019t want to fall off a cliff <br/>or get stuck with a boat on the surface of the moon, you\u2019d better be fast and look closely.<br/> <br/>Dozens of worlds and cars are waiting to be discovered. So join the Multi Race, and show us how to match the right vehicle with a proper environment!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-28T04:46:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/14f/14fcd2924f03444be560b099c4f7e623.jpg", "website": "https://www.pixelmobgames.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 172, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["PixelMob"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": ["PixelMob"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
