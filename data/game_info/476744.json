Mankind, seeing the writing on the wall, has left en masse for greener pastures, seeking refuge amongst the major powers in the Milky Way: the Republic of Orion, the Cygnusian Empire, and the Alliance of Minor Systems. Little does the fledgling interstellar species know, that pledging allegiance to one faction over the other could prove deadly. There has long been tension between the Orions and the Cygnusians, boiling to the brink of total war. Will you fight for freedom with the liberating armies of the Republic of Orion? Will you\u00a0fight for honor and glory under the totalitarian Cygnusian Empire? Or will you fight for\u00a0profit in the corrupt, pacifistic Alliance of Minor Systems?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T04:49:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a3e/a3ef5ce0d862813945ebab51c3a49ece.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ROSSCOGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
