In the video, we'll show how to easily connect the $12.99 WWII Wargame King's Quest III II soundtrack, featuring the score from the first three games in the original trilogy of games. We'll also be playing the original audio track from the game, presented by Arjen Rho. As your play progresses, watch out for the voice of the New World Order player \"Brandon\" (and the eagle-eyed reader can probably spot him) as he uses the funds for his own air-raid defence project. \"Never occurred\" is a by-product of the company's new partnership with the military and air force, resulting in a video game that will be available for purchase and download in the new year.<br/>\nThis is 'Never occurred', a new video game from Outhouse Media.
