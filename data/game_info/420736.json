You don't need any knowledge of Solar Echoes to enjoy the game, but you might notice some \u201ceaster eggs\u201d if you're familiar. The story begins... </p>\n<p><em>Only a few generations have passed since the discovery of Faster-Than-Light speed travel. FTL has transformed the universe, and several alien races have realized they are not alone. Some have managed to peacefully interact and begin a tenuous trade relationship. Others, however, have become locked in bitter wars.</em></p>\n<em>\n<p>The need for the Interstellar Union (ISU) was first realized by the Humans and Reln, though the Reln still claim it was their idea. It was agreed that all the known races should be included in the ISU. But who would answer the call to represent their species and extend an invitation to the others?</p>\n<p>You, the player of the Human protagonist Trey Donovan, will need to make many crucial decisions during this sensitive mission. Success will result in the formation of the Interstellar Union--a peaceful alliance among all the known races that will promote trade and cultural exchange. Failure, however, could mean your death, the end of the ISU before it ever begins, or even a massive interstellar war.<br/><em>Choose your words carefully and consider every decision you make. The gift of FTL could be a blessing towards a prosperous future among the stars. Or, it could become a curse that swiftly delivers the threat of alien annihilation to your people.</em><br/></p>\n<p><strong>Character Profiles<br/></strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\r\nCrew Relationships &amp; Romance\r\n\r\n<p>Your relationship with each of your alien crew members depends on what you say. Will you gain their trust and respect? Or will they oppose and possibly even betray you? Hidden variables calculate how they will behave at some of the most crucial moments in the game.</p>\n<p>Two different human women will be in contact with you during your journey. You can keep it totally professional if you choose, but\u2026it gets lonely being the only human among an alien crew! Multiple endings depend on your conversations and possible flirtations with the ladies. Can long distance in space really work?</p>\n\r\nRPG-Style\u00a0Character\u00a0Design \r\n<p>Trey Donovan is the human protagonist, but you will get to decide what some of his skills are. Is he an engineer or a hacker? Is he persuasive, or more discerning? Is he skilled in the martial arts, or with firearms? Your decisions will change the options and situations throughout the game, and though any path can lead to success, each will have its own challenges.</p>\n\r\nGame Features\r\nComplex Branching Storylines\r\n<p>Your decisions affect what happens! Some choices can mean life or death, and others can subtly influence a relationship that might affect your situation later in the game. There are multiple paths to success and failure!</p>\r\nAn Expressive Cast of Characters\r\n<p>Some characters have over 100 facial expressions, which really brings a new dynamic to visual novel dialogue as they interact during conversations. However, some alien characters are easier to read than others! Get to know each character so you can manage your starship crew. You never know how each relationship might affect the story!<br/></p>\r\nStand Before Alien Leaders\r\n<p>This is a diplomatic mission, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone will be agreeable. Know when it\u2019s appropriate to use your clever wit, an aggressive tone, or a conciliatory approach. The fate of your species might depend on it. No pressure!<br/></p>\r\nAdventures Across a Dangerous Universe\r\n<p>The Star Legation will take you to mysterious alien planets, powerful interstellar anomalies, and even throw you into deadly starship battles. A rare fight might even erupt in your own starship, if you get boarded!</p>\r\nEaster-Eggs for Solar Echoes fans!\r\n<p>Gamers familiar with the Solar Echoes tabletop RPG may discover some insider references in the visual novel and hidden meanings in the artwork!<br/></p>\r\nOriginal Soundtrack\r\n<p>Discover the music of guitarist and composer Andy Mitchell, including adaptations of his unique compositions as well as original music composed specifically for this space opera!<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Sci-Fi Space Opera, Adventure, RPG Elements, Romance, Dramedy, Mystery</p>\n<ul><li>The Star Legation\u2019s beautifully authentic style blends realism with a cel-shaded, anime touch.
