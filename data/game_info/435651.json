This, however, broke the nice bloom post-processing effect that the game had. Oh well, lesson learned! If you are on Windows, I've provided a Windows standalone build as well available for download.  Oh, and also, the \"quit game\" button breaks the web player, apparently.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T14:16:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f0/3f0f74cff42eb0165d18ece3a8e207f3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["ArttuHalonen"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
