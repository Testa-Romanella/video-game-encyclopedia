Her story was burned to ash and the pages are all but smeared across lies and rumors. Yet, I still remember...\"\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Summary</strong>\r\nAether Skies tells the story of the destruction of Idwall. A kingdom paying for their use of aether during their war of conquest. They have few allies and are in a weakened state with the recent attack on their king who was delivered to them in a blooded crate. Though he survived the assault he was deemed unfit to rule and his older sister inherited the throne. As the memoir unfolds you choose to witness the story as the inheriting Exalt or as the Scion Eir, a man who is the last of his kind haunted by aether.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\r\n<strong>Character Profiles</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p><strong>Exalt</strong><br/>It was never meant to yours. That\u2019s what even the people of your court tell you to your face as your parade in the game of politics and lies as their ruler. This wasn\u2019t meant to be your life. Your younger brother gave you the freedom to choose your passion and your love. Now, it\u2019s all gone. You\u2019re left on your pedestal holding the broken and shattered pieces of your country from a war tormented by the Scion\u2019s curse, while emissaries from the north threatens to take your crown, and your brother\u2019s mutilation and mental retardation is left unsolved. Now there\u2019s him, the Scion, the last of his kind.<br/><br/><strong>Scion Eir</strong><br/>Running, that\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re truly good at. You spent your life living in fear of your \u201cgift\u201d. Yet, \u201cAether is a curse\u201d, it always has been. The way it also seems to find you and torment the ones you care about keeps you ever drifting. You were tricked in believing from the nomads that there was a way to control the aether. Stop it from destroying everything that you had ever grown attached too. The warm arms of the oracle Sophea were just another face that you scared. Keep your feet moving and your head low. That\u2019s the only way to survive.<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/>Aether Skies has choice driven game-play, where you choose a character to start with. As you play the memoir not only do your choices influence one character, but both in dynamic ways. There is a default game start that each character begins with. If you choose to start the story with Eir you will make choices that influence his life. When you finish the story and go onto the Exalt's side you see how the choices you made with Eir affect Reina and provoke difference responses. You can always choose to replay with a blank slate or you can import your play through after finishing the story. The focus isn't on different endings, but on different journey to the same destruction of Idwall. The kingdom is doomed. Do you play to save one character, save each, or save the kingdom? The end results are all tied up in choices you get to choose.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/>Aether Skies: Scion currently contains over 40,000 words and over 100 choices and counting.<br/>CG's in game (4 in first chapter alone)<br/>4 Romance Options (Previews to come)<br/>An alternative reading font<br/>Choices can be selected with number keys<br/>Quick Save and Load option<br/><br/><strong>Progress:</strong>\u00a0Post Last Updated February 28, 2018<br/><br/><strong>To Those Who Played the Demo</strong><br/>To those who played the demo version 1.1 or older.
