Work and stuff. This is all I could make. Had fun making it. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p>Controls: W for jumping an hold it when bouncing of walls may help. S makes you fall a bit faster and on ground it turns you to face the other way. Wall bouncing is a bit weird, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Reach the goal at the top of the level and have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/56f/56f4cbd0cfff39d15285eabf0bb91bed.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HarryNotWizard"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
