Each element increases mass, to an already heavy arsenal.<br/></li><li>Cold weapons and hand to hand combat. In case you will run out of ammo. Should you carry a lightweight fast combat knife or a more hard-hitting but heavy baseball bat? Or a long boat-hook to keep the monsters at bay? Is a trusty old axe enough, or should you carry a real sword if you can find one? In any case, you will need strength, agility and correct skills for proper use.<br/></li><li>Wounds, bleeding, disease, hunger, thirst, sleep deprivation, fatigue...
