As more candles go out, more of THEM appear.</p>\n<p>The game was built from scratch using the RPGMV tool over a period of 5 days. It is short, but sweet. I would welcome any feedback about the game at all, good and bad.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-03-09T04:33:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/47a/47ae2d80c0b22f2433b6e37a1ce5348d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["HivanGames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
