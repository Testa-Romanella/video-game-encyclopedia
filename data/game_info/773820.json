Brew potions  for people, challenge yourself with moral dilemmas, or just have fun and  hope for the next day to come. Try not to get your fame or fear too high or too low, lest something terrible happens. If you save enough money you can move to another village, but how much longer will you be able to delay the inevitable?</p>\n<p>Controls hint: you can toggle the recipe book with SPACE and browse it with arrows or A/D keys.<br/><br/>\r\nThe game was initially made for the  local Ludum Dare as a Jam entry, but due to tons of text we weren\u2019t  able to translate it in time, so now we can submit it as Extra (Hurray  for the new Extra category!) Also we used that extra time to thoroughly  revise the interface and make twice as much text. <br/><br/>Cauldron was made by:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Moreen Tissedy \u2014\u00a0code\u00a0&amp;\u00a0gamedesign\r\n</li><li>Andrei Sharikov \u2014 gamedesign\r\n</li><li>EdvarT \u2014 UI,\u00a0animations,\u00a0VFX\r\n</li><li>Nikita Kapitunov \u2014 art\r\n</li><li>Undiy \u2014 music</li><li>Sergei Melkozerov \u2014 translations</li></ul><p>Tools: Unity, Photoshop, Spine, Reaper<br/>\n</p>\n<p>Sound effects taken from freesound.org<br/><br/>\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c: https://minigames.itch.io/cauldron<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-22T17:19:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/07b/07b225e2e17a5740d8e68e2f45a91271.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 171, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Moreen Tissedy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
