Designed for 2 players &amp; made for the first Unofficial Game Boy Jam. Very WIP, may not go back to this properly but I do want to make a proper version with menus\u00a0+ sound.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS<br/>Z key: </strong>Select card<br/><strong>Arrow Keys: </strong>Move cursor/Move mech</p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS<br/></strong><em><strong>OneWeirdGuy</strong>\u00a0</em>for mech &amp; pilot sprite work</p>\n<p><strong>\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GUIDE<br/></strong><em><strong>Mechs &amp; Pilots -</strong></em> Each Player has a team of two Mechs and two Pilots. Each Player's Mech/Pilot 1 are located at the top of the movement grid, while each Player's Mech/Pilot 2 are located at the bottom of the movement grid. All four parts of your team\u00a0(your two mechs and two pilots) will determine how your deck is set up.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Selecting Cards -</strong></em> When selecting cards, you select cards in the order of:</p>\n<p><strong>Mech 1</strong> &gt;<strong> Mech 2</strong>\u00a0&gt; <strong>Hold Card</strong> &gt;<strong> Discard Card</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>The first two will play that action for that mech on the current turn.</li><li>\"Hold Card\" will place the card back into your deck.</li><li>\"Discard Card\" will discard the card permanently from your deck.</li></ul>\n<p><em><strong>Attacking -</strong> </em>When attacking, you will always deal 1 damage to the opponent. Certain cards will change how much damage you deal, as well as heal some of your damage. Your team's health is a shared unit, so keep both of your mechs in the right position at the right time!<strong><em>Card Types</em></strong></p>\n<strong>ATK SHRT<br/></strong>One of a Mech's standard moves. Attacks one square above, below and on both sides of a Mech.<strong>ATK DIAG</strong>A modified version of a Mech's standard attack. This attacks at four tiles at once - the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right of a Mech's current position.<strong>DMG UP</strong>On the next turn, your Mech's attack will become beefed up, and apply +1 extra DMG.<strong>DMG MAX</strong>This uses all of the Mech's available power and increases the Mech's attack by +3 extra DMG.<strong>HEAL DMG</strong>Uses extra resources to heal the\u00a0player's team health by 1.<strong>DODGE</strong>Conserves a Mech's energy to enable him to dodge the next enemy Mech's attack.<strong>GRENADE</strong>An explosive attack that attacks in ATK SHRT and ATK DIAG tiles at the same time! Doing so comes with a setback - you'll attack your opponent for 2 DMG, but get 1 DMG to your team as well.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["DynamicDonut"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
