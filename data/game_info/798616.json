A bit of a jam imposed by myself for the long public holiday here we have in the UK. It took me 2-3 days ish to get to this point. I\u00a0am not sure I will do much more with this game but it was a fun little project.\u00a0\r\nThe main addition here from my last game (smashy) was the destructible tile maps and a lot more particle effects. I\u00a0have also added some tutorial elements which was quite time consuming.\u00a0\r\nI also spent quite a bit of time learning how to add bones to 2d sprites which was interesting. The character here is very small but it is still rigged up to do a lot more.\u00a0\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-06-06T13:03:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/191/191ebdf815bdc48f8d417477a7b48bf1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mearlam"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
