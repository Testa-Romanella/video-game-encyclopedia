I should have reached out and asked about fixing it but that's hard for me right now, I'll try to get better. Hopefully you can look at my modifications even though that is an issue. My apologies.</p>\n<p>My modifications:</p>\n<p>1. Retextured and animated player and enemies.</p>\n<p>2. Made more intricate level design and added soundtracks to them.</p>\n<p>3. Re textured environment and animated details.</p>\n\n<p>Made By Rachel Flatley</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-03-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-03-25T12:28:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/173/1737223582208da442340dba6d26d719.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["flatleyr"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
