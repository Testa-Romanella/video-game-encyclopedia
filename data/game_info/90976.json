She desperately wants to join the Normal Boots Club, though her motives may be less than pure. Shy, awkward, quiet, and a wee bit insecure, she has a big heart and genuinely cares about people.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mai</strong> is Hana's loud, boisterous, and spunky roommate. She's obsessed with the Normal Boots Club, Jared in particular, and is a bit blunt. Her excessive energy makes her an ace on the school's volleyball team.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jon</strong> is one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club and the head of the Drama Club. He adores bizarre retro games, and loves his pet bird, Jacques, more than life itself. Jon is charismatic, energetic, and animated. Everything seems to be going well for him - that is, until he loses something dear...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PBG</strong><strong>, </strong>one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club, is an easy-going, caring, and optimistic guy. He doesn't bother with school, instead focusing on important things like soccer and pinball. Despite his friendliness, he's giving Hana strange looks, and then starts skipping class...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jared</strong> is a part-time model. Naturally, he is the most attractive person in school and knows it, often coming off as vain, fickle, and shallow. Despite this, Jared truly cares for his friends, and the confidence he projects may not be as solid as it appears.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Satch</strong> is an assistant librarian at the school library working on a virtual reality machine. Satch is intellectual, empathetic, mature and well-read. He always thinks of others' feelings before his own, but keeps his problems to himself - which might backfire when Normal Boots is targeted...\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><br/>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Shane</strong> is a foreign exchange student from England. Quiet, straightforward, and blunt, he's a natural with trivia competitions, but instead chooses to challenge himself with Nario Cart. Despite how much the club needs Hana's skills, he is steadfastly against her joining.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jirard</strong> is an avid collector of Itty Bitty Kitty figurines. Passionate, ambitious, and a bit of a perfectionist, he is the resident speed-runner. Perhaps as a result of his need to complete, he does well both academically and socially, being one of the most caring people on campus.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n<strong>Paul, Nick, and Josh</strong> are blood bound under Continue?'s banner. They are inseparable and typically found wreaking general havoc by reenacting the '80s and '90s arcade beat-em-ups they love so dearly. Paul is running for student council president, but when a strong rival appears, will the pressure of competition be too much?\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tFor a complete list of everyone who worked on the project, please visit \r\n\t<strong>Asagao Academy's credits page</strong>.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThere is a \r\n\t<strong>tip system</strong> in place in case you'd like to support us in making future games. \r\n\tThank you so much if you do!\r\n\t<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tIf you have any troubles, check out our \r\n\t<strong>Technical Support page</strong>!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThanks for playing.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>04.27.2016</strong> - Asagao Academy version 0.5 is out!
