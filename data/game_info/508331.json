They must work together to create ropes and climb past obstacles in order to get to the final platform.</p>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>Both players start at the bottom of a mountain. One player has the ability to move and jump, and the other player has the ability to throw a rope. If a player throws a rope to the other successfully, a rope is created between the two of them. The controls then swap over, so the player who threw the rope can now move, and the player who was moving must now throw a rope to them.\u00a0</p>\r\nGame controls\u00a0\r\nRed character:\r\n<p>WASD keys to move</p>\n<p>Space key to climb/create rope</p>\n<p>Click to confirm rope</p>\r\nBlue character:\r\n<p>Arrow keys to move</p>\n<p>Right Ctrl key to climb/create rope</p>\n<p>Click to confirm rope</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T07:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aeb/aeb6bc0ec301a8c170c09e0ca4c44b9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["CoderCat", "Veguista", "Wandering_Owl", "Indibulous"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
