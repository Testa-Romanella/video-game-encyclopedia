{"id": 114979, "slug": "fox-ears", "name": "Fox Ears", "name_original": "Fox Ears", "description": "<p>\r\n\tFox Ears is a rhythm-based action platforming game, with elements of infinite running games such as Temple Run. You play as a fox attempting to retrieve a magical flower from the Land of the Owls to cure the residents of your fox village, but the Land of the Owls is a dangerous place and you'll have to overcome many obstacles set to the beat of the music to achieve your goal.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tFox ears was developed as part of Global Game Jam 15 (although was not stable enough to be uploaded to the jam site). This is a very similar version, just with less falling through the level.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tDownloading is recommended, but it can also be played in the Unity Web Player \r\n\there. XBox 360 controller is strongly recommended (left stick to move, A to jump), but keyboard can be used in a pinch (WASD to move, space to jump). If you do fall through the level, you should respawn when the camera catches up to you. If that doesn't seem to be the case, you can hit p at any point to return to the main menu.\r\n</p><p>\n<br/>\n</p><p>\r\n\tYoutube Link \r\n</p><p>\r\n\tComments/Suggestions/Questions/Bugs can be sent to @CraigRThomas on Twitter, or emailed to craig.thomas36(at)gmail.com. The @AngrySquidGames Twitter should be live in a few days.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e21/e2199d40d6cba5a2ad64922ec5eae98b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 74, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AngrySquidGames"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
