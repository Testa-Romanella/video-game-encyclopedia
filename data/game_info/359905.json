I\r\nhadn't made a game in HTML/Javascript before, so I figured it could be a decent challenge.</p>\n<p>The visuals in the game are accomplished using a 2D matrix of ASCII characters that are updated on a regular interval to achieve a constant \"framerate\", with the characters moved between rows and colums of the matrix to simulate motion.</p>\n<p>All code is publicly available on Github here: https://github.com/benbusby/tiny-moon-runner<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T10:51:22", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Ben Busby"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
