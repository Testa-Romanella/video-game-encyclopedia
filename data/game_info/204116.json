You navigate around each level by tilting your device and riding the jumping Bllux. Along the way, you collect Blue Diamonds and Orange Goals to complete each level and unlock Hard Mode.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tCan you find all the Blue Diamonds in each of the 15 levels? As an added challenge, each level has an unlockable Hard Mode, making for 30 unique levels of gameplay!\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/879/879a721d5cb253eb1a03bd1059a9ad26.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 116, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonathan A Daley"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
