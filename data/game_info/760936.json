These abilities will help you across those difficult level.</p>\n<p>Though I try my best to refact some parts of levels , its level design is\u00a0 still terrible.Although it is not a excellent game, I promise this game's elements is complete. It has audio, music ,\u00a0 normal image,\u00a0opening of a show and ending of a show.
