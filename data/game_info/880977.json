{"id": 880977, "slug": "baccentian-guide-2e-playtest", "name": "Baccentian Guide (2e) Playtest", "name_original": "Baccentian Guide (2e) Playtest", "description": "<p><strong>As the Authority rises in power, it looms over Baccentia, home of the Torpere and the tradition of Guides who work to keep Baccentia safe.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You\u00a0are\u00a0a\u00a0Guide.\u00a0You\u00a0can\u00a0turn\u00a0the\u00a0destruction\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Torpere\u00a0against\u00a0the\u00a0<br/>Authority, but you know that the Torpere is not a weapon. It is a living thing.\r\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Baccentian Guide is a fan made supplementary Playbook for Armor Astir Advent. Instead of piloting an Astir, The Guide summons a Torpere to the battle.\u00a0The Torpere is a chimeric entity, half\u00a0mysterious temple and half gargantuan creature. Additionally, each Torpere is associated with a Natural Disaster.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a Tier IV being, the Guide has some incredible power at the start of the game, but must be careful not to fail; if they err enough, the Torpere will buck the Guide's control and inflict a calamity.\u00a0 Additional moves can be taken as \"jumping off points\"\u00a0to get into themes of domestication, forbidden power, self-sacrifice, and climate crisis.\u00a0<br/><br/>This second edition is something I have always wanted to return to. It's something I want to sit with and think about so often. The more I play and learn about Armor Astir: Advent and what I want from it, the more I want to develop the skills to better articulate that. The direction has changed from the first \"edition\"\u00a0and that file will still stay up, like the\u00a0outdated relics the titular creature it seeks to conjure. In the future, this page will be taken down, the playbook maybe modified following feedback, and I will seek out some basic layout and art to give you something inspirational to look at.\u00a0<br/><br/>You can leave\u00a0feedback in the replies or comments here on itch.io, or by emailing me at ScampirGames@hotmail.com. Anywhere you can find me on social media is welcome too.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-14T14:21:42", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Scampir"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
