Arrow keys and space bar work as well.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to get to the round door at the end of each room. When standing next to a heat source, you absorb its heat, increasing your temperature. Be careful though, as each heat source only has so much warmth to give! You also slowly lose heat over time when not near a source of warmth.</p>\n<p>As an ice cube, you can jump and push down buttons to open colored doors.<br/></p>\n<p>As liquid water, you can't jump or push buttons but can walk and fall through grates.</p>\n<p>As steam, you slowly float upwards and can pass through grates.</p>\n<p><strong>CREDITS:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Character and heat source art/animation: Xander Goodwin</li><li>Gameplay programming and level design: Daniel Kowalski</li><li>UI programming and level implementation: William O'Brien</li><li>Animation programming and heat source programming: David Smith</li><li>Map sprites:\u00a0https://ipixl.itch.io/pixel-art-metal-tileset</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-03-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-03-19T08:35:40", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3af/3af35a7b610adf09a1dfaf1e40243694.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["TecKirb"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
