You've been hanging out in the afterlife with your friends, Khufu, Tutankhamen, and Cleopatra, as well as your boy Osiris. However, in recent years, you've seen most of your friends become suddenly bankrupt and you realized you might very well be next. So you hopped into Ra's boat and rode with him into the day, and back to the mortal world. Your mummy, preserved in linens, accepted your spirit, and now allows you to fortify your temple against intruders. There is no one here yet, but they will come. It is up to you to protect your wealth and ensure that your afterlife vacation will never end.(edited)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-03T09:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d67/d679fb59b3acd8d248bb2e29462347ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["MemeRegimeStudios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
