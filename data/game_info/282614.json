No time for partying though as your first mission awaits! The Orbees are all missing. Yes, those curious little beings made of energy who power our time-tech are nowhere to be fou... no, wait! We have a faint trace on their signal. Are you brave enough to rescue them?</p>\n<p>Prepare yourself for unknown dangers. If you find some of the Orbees they might equip your Space-Time Machine with new tech. Decide who is in charge of each gadget and combine your abilities to discover the best strategies.</p>\n<p>Use cunning, comradeship and co-operation to survive and never forget the Academy motto: \u201cBFF or Die!\u201d<br/></p>\r\nBest Friends Forever\r\n<p>BFF or Die is a game for you if:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>You want a 2-4 player game to play with your partner/family/friends where you get to do everything as a team.\r\n</li><li>Pure co-operation sounds fun to you as it\u2019s a different feeling when you all work together.\r\n</li><li>You like games that are easy to start playing but then gradually get more challenging.\r\n</li><li>You like games that let you figure things out yourself rather than \u201chand holding\u201d you too much and telling you what to do.\u00a0</li><li>You want a game with a fun, short campaign mode which adds replayability by having difficult trophies to collect and also an unlockable \u201cInfinite\u201d mode.</li></ul>\r\nIs There Online Multiplayer?\r\n<p>We do not have native online multiplayer support\u2026 BUT\u2026 you *can* play with your friends online by using Parsec. Parsec (which is free to use) lets you share games with friends by streaming your screen and sound  to them. Their inputs (control pad or keyboard commands) then get sent to you and with almost no lag (depending on your computer and internet). This let's you play  real-time online co-op together..!<br/></p>\r\nWhat to Expect\r\n<p>We strongly recommend playing in co-op 2, 3 or 4 player mode as this is when the game is most fun. Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a guide:</p>\n<p>1-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p>2-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p>3-Player story game: 2-3 hours</p>\n<p>4-Player story game: 2-3 hours <br/></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Infinite Trials\u201d: 1-999 hours! Or maybe \u221e hours :) Complete as many randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing. Go back to the start if you die.</p>\n<p>You can either share controllers (two people per controller) or have separate controllers. As a minimum you need the keyboard and one control pad to have a 4-player game. Or you can use four separate control pads, it\u2019s up to you.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable \u201cInfinite Trials\u201d mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels.<br/></p>\r\nIs My Computer Fast Enough?\r\n<p>If you have a dedicated graphics card and your laptop or desktop PC can normally play 3D games smoothly then you should be able to run BFF or Die just fine.<br/></p>\n<p>If you have a high resolution screen (like with newer Macbooks) then you will probably want to set the bootup options of the game to 1920x1080 to get a smooth frame rate.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-20T20:38:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/740/74011123880aec3556992daab99a4897.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 324, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["ASA Studio"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
