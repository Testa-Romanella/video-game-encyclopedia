Probably, also my favourite. It was inspired in the ZX Spectrum game \"Molecule Man\" and here I introduced the \"Spherical Man\" that also had a role in my later games.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While inspecting a biochemical laboratory, the spherical man got accidentally infected with a lethal toxin. Now, he gets weaker every step he makes and his life depends on some special pills that slow down the infection. His only salvation are the ten parts of the antidot spread through the lab, which has a maze-like structure.\r\n </p>\n<p>\u00a0Now, the spherical man is out to find the parts of the antidot. Fortunately, spread through the labs are the pills he needs and some bombs. The pills preserve him from death and the bombs allow him to destroy some walls. But beware, he must find the ten parts of the antidot before he runs out of pills or he will die!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-06T06:45:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/92a/92a0f7e7b2757d1d5b14eb3f80a075ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Naranjito Games"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
