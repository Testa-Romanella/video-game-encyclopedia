There are many buttons and sliders that can help you control how the creatures behave and how they evolve! Each creature has a vision of 20 rays that feed into a Neural Network with the shape [20, 13, 6, 3]. The three outputs control the creatures forward/backward motion, sideways motion, and turn direction.<br/>This evolution of the creatures is based on \"Survival of the Fittest\". This is where creatures that do better get better scores and have better odds of breeding. The offspring will be born as exact copies as their parent but then will be mutated based on the Creature Mutation slider. The Breed Threshold slider is what percentage of the 100 best creatures will be selected to produce a new offspring.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-01-01T02:20:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f85/f851052c3a2229ac40b4b419c9d817a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["SpicyMelon"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
