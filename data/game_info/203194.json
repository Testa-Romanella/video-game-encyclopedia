Currently the gameplay is very basic and limited. you can mine by facing the wall and pressing k, open your inventory by pressing o (very basic placeholder inventory at the moment) drop things you down want eg. tailings then leave the mine by pressing k while standing behind the lift bucket then proceed to the bank to sell your ores (the building with a $ on it). When I get back to this project it will be expanded to include energy and hunger systems, various services provided by the different buildings, mine upgrades, placeable ladders lanterns and tunnel supports, different character tools and much more.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a5d/a5d54bdf02ed8957eb7e4798940a0b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Menacer20"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
