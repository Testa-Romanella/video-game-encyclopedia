Big Kudos to him!</strong><br/><br/><strong>Game Instructions :</strong><br/>- Create or Join an exisiting room from the given list<br/>- While in-game press [Esc.] to see mouse cursor. You can use this to drag certain objects in the level.<br/>- Use a tool like Discord for VoIP etc. as the game does not support for any communication medium!\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Known Bugs\u00a0:\u00a0</strong><br/>- Player Name Banners appear incorrect<br/>-\u00a0\u00a0\"Rabana\" Only Works when multiple players interact with it (feature? lol)<br/>- Sometimes you may not be able to connect due to server concurrent user limit<br/><br/><em>I will be releasing this game in such Alpha state as there's no point of releasing this past the festive season. Already way behind my planned schedule of releasing on the 12th April Midnight. Anyway, any feedback is appreciated and let me know if you would like to extend support (payment for servers, feature suggestions, marketing etc.).\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-17T11:08:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b53/b53ed243327157645f72cd689e1dd4b2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 94, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Isuru Edirisinghe"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
