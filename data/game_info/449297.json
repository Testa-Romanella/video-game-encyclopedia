Upon finding a character with features prone to personal acknowledgment, the player will experience feelings of empathy and peace of mind. Through this feeling, the game will allow individuals in isolation to express as well as recognize their feelings in a way that stimulates self-care and introspection as a response to the emotional challenges they face nowadays due to the pandemic. The project\u2019s intent is to urge people to find comfort and strength within themselves.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-01T02:37:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c79/c7958f7c9030ada34fcdfdf792d788e1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mono Spaces Studio"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
