At the outset we brainstormed the idea of a mushroom management game where the mushrooms would communicate back to the player their own desires for where to next plant them -- which other\u00a0mushroom type to next be planted\u00a0near and which type to next\u00a0avoid being near. You can see the beginnings of implementing this communication\u00a0in the current build, however, the mechanic needs to be more finely tuned and also currently has no gameplay relevance. Ideally, upon further development,\u00a0this game will feel quite a bit more arcade-like to play,\u00a0as the player is meant to be consistently\u00a0rotating around the garden, planting new mushrooms based on their respective\u00a0desires, and picking fully grown mushrooms before they begin to decay (which is\u00a0also not currently implemented). For now, you may consider this just a cute, casual experience for planting some adorable lil' mushroom pals!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-06T06:27:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d90ad237f0981a8293afcc0269ab7947.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Rohifi", "weezwuzhere", "Corrin Coffey", "GraySFX"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
