Eventually, I managed to restore it, fix some bugs and add a soundtrack. I probably won't continue working with this project/engine in particular, but I might come back to its ideas in the future.<br/><br/><strong>SUMMARY</strong><br/>THESEUX is a Metroid-inspired game, with 2 areas to explore and a boss fight. Your character, Agent THESEUX needs to find the alien terrorists hiding in planet Lotur, while finding powerups and collecting crystals (unused). Use the savepoints throughout the map to heal and save the game.<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS</strong> (also check ingame GUIDE)<br/>Arrow keys LEFT\u00a0and RIGHT to move, UP and DOWN to aim.<br/>SPACE (and \"\\\" for non-american keyboards) to jump.<br/>Z to use your Z item (gun) and X to use your X item (tool).<br/>S changes Z item and D changes your X item (if multiple are available).<br/><br/>Hold SHIFT or M to bring up the minimap (not controlable).<br/>P and ESC to pause the game.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the game, and comments and feedback are very appreciated!!<br/>(you don't need to donate to get the files, but feel free to leave a dolar or so)<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS - SPECIAL THANKS<br/></strong>Dr. Petter's SFXR - Sound effects<br/>BeepBox Team - Music<br/><br/>KaraEmbershard, Spikey and Buisi - Playtesting</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-02-22T13:13:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a34/a34ad916ee532376d33b4af170f1f55f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 97, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["nate-the-bard"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
