He wants to play!<br/>Snake Party is a multiplayer game where the player maneuvers a dot that leaves a trail (a.k.a. \"Snake\"). Based on the concept of classical snake games it enhances the atmosphere, featuring multiple snakes competing against each other.

You gain points whenever a fellow player hits an obstacle before you do.<br/>The controls are fully customizable, just as the number of rounds.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate party game because it needs <strong>no long explanations</strong>, <strong>no special system requirements</strong>, and can be played by <strong>up to six people</strong> on the same computer!
