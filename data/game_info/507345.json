The theme is Carpe Diem: seize the day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We have gone with a situation many have probably been in. From times when we were little and saw those dreaded \"back to school\" adverts and sales at the end of the Summer Holidays. You would then spend how ever long left of the Summer trying to fill it with even more fun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So that's the aim of this little game.\u00a0It's nearly the end of the Summer Holidays and you have 3 days to cram in as much fun as possible before you are back in School. You have about 5 minutes each day to tick off the little list of fun things/mini games\u00a0you need to do. Can you complete all the tasks before school starts?</p>\r\nKeyboard supported only. Here are the controls.\u00a0\r\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p><p>3D Artists</p><p>Betsy Jones,\u00a0Callum Reyes,\u00a0Ryan Da Silva,\u00a0Cameron Mallen<br/></p><p>Programmers + VFX</p><p>James Carr,\u00a0Will Wood<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T03:17:28", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/eef/eef842fda075942f194ed71a71418d97.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["EggGangGames"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
