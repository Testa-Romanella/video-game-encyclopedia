It was done in less than 50 hours. Graphic in game is simple, because I can't draw, but in the next games I will try to focus on the graphics.\r\nYou must kill enemies. You can upgrade weapon (speed bullet, reload, dispersion) or health boost, but you need to spend your points wisely, because you can buy up to 10 times. The more you kill enemies, the harder game is.\r\nTechnical description\r\n<strong>Controls</strong><strong>: </strong>WAD<br/><strong>Shooting</strong><strong>:</strong> left mouse button<br/><strong>Open/Close Shop</strong>: E<br/><strong>Spawn Time Enemy:\u00a0</strong><em><em>5 sec</em></em><em><em>ond</em></em><br/>if you buy 3 times = 4 second<br/><em>if you buy 5 times = 3 second<br/>if you buy 7 times = 2 second<br/>if you buy 9 times = 1 second<br/><strong>Spawn Enemy:</strong><br/>if you kill less than 10 enemies == red enemy<br/>if you kill more than 10 enemies and less than 40 enemies\u00a0== red enemy and blue enemy<br/>if you kill more than 40 enemies == red enemy, blue enemy and purple enemy<br/>if you kill 50 times enemies, spawn the boss<br/></em>\r\nWhat did I\u00a0learn in this project?\r\n<ul><li>make a tutorial in the game</li><li>make a boss with animation</li><li>make a shop</li><li>make a simple random map</li><li>post-processing</li><li>mouse control</li><li>make better animation</li><li>better use TextMeshPro</li><li>communicating between scripts</li></ul>\n\r\nUsed:\r\n<ul><li>https://pimen.itch.io/holy-spell-effect</li><li>https://comp3interactive.itch.io/modern-royal-purple-gui</li><li>https://danielbm.itch.io/tiny-buttons-custom-your-button</li><li>https://gentoogames.itch.io/punching-bag-physics-dummy</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/8bit-music-album-051321-196147</li><li>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/shooting-sound-177096</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-11T07:12:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5a275eeae925952dfef4d220cc9ea8a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["LudosG"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
