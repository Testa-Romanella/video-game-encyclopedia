Maybe in another version of the game later on.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-02T03:19:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1eb/1ebcc38ae1d8a95937aff80981f6dda0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ProjectZero"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
