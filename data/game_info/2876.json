Ideal for families and/or kids. <br/><br/>\u2022 2-4 player battle royals.<br/>\u2022 2 on 2 team play.<br/>\u2022 Co-op vs AI play.<br/>\u2022 1 on 1 play.<br/>\u2022 Various maps and terrain features.<br/>\u2022 3 different modes of play. <br/>\u2022 Select unit custom deployments.<br/>\u2022 Simple map editing and unit re-positioning.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this game is that you can shoot or set defensive states when it&amp;#39;s not your turn.  So everyone always has something to do with this &amp;#39;huddle&amp;#39; style game.<br/><br/>UI INTERACTIVE<br/>Drag and drop, tap units to change state, double tap kegs to heal, pull back to aim and shoot (if loaded and in shoot mode).<br/><br/>STRATEGY<br/>The strategy is not just about movement and positioning \u2013 it also involves line of sight crossbow shooting, shot blocking, axe melee &amp;amp; mass beserking. Injured units don\u2019t just bleed and lose hit points \u2013 they do less damage and can\u2019t move as far. \u00a0And the one unit you have to protect also happens to be a healer.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The great Keg Bearer (considered to be the king) has a healing &amp;#39;Keg of ALE&amp;#39; that he sprays upon adjacent units.  If you kill this unit then you win as no dwarf wants to fight without his ALE!!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2011-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:57:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c5f/c5fe0c5bbb84adaece1b52910325e68b_5p73MXz.jpeg", "website": "https://musketsmoke.wordpress.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 177, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Snowpunch"], "genres": ["Board Games", "Family"], "publishers": ["Woodie Dovich"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
