Your mission: serve customers, upgrade your drinks, food, and services, and eventually earn enough to pay off your loan.

I haven't decided whether I'll add anything more to this version of the game, but let me know if you find any bugs and I'll try to address them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T07:08:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/611/61147068da53e72d8ce29db3fd3d4743.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 117, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["Don Bisdorf"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
