Gameplay is centered around a (slightly) detailed combo system of heavy and light attacks. Coupled with AI, it isn't as easy as button mashing to fight. The narrative puts the player inside a foggy forest ridden with enmity and thought. The player only has their attacks to fend off thought, as well as memories which can heal the player.</p><p>It's mostly bare bones, but it helps push a player experience forward. 3D models are off the asset store.</p><p>Gamepad extremely recommended.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>A-Jump B-Interact X-Light Y-Heavy</p><p>LB-Special RB-Memory RT-Dash</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-01-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe7/fe7e0148e88421350db932f72a176add.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 54, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["C#"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
