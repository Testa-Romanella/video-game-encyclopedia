It is still in its very early stages but Im trying to get out a playable demo as soon as possible. The main mechanic will be switching between 2 (or maybe 3) characters. You will also be able (most likely) to switch between 2d and 3d mode.\u00a0Im currently mainly working on the combat and some enemy AI. This game is in no way finished, nor do I expect any kind of payment for this piece of spaghetti code. Im uploading this so I can easily share the game with some friends and helpers.</p>\n\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>WASD - movement</p>\n<p>Space - jump</p>\n<p>Left click - attack (you have to click to charge your crossbow and a second time to shoot it)</p>\n<p>FUTURE PLANS:</p>\n<p>In the future I want to add mechanics such as a dash, a double jump and other smaller things to the individual characters (so for example A can dash while B can double jump), aswell as some real levels. My plan right now is it to focus on the mechanics and gameplay and move on to level design once I feel like the movement and combat feels good. For the levels I want to have an open world with a room system. (kinda like hollow knight) The game will be set in the version of hell from dante's inferno.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-13T08:34:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2c5/2c594d26d28348cdd83a8f5ecf659dc6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["I_Am_Not_Talented"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
