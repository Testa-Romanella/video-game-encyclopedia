It actually turned out a lot harden than I\u00a0initially thought. I\u00a0don't really want to say much more than that for fear of spoiling things.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the in-game iconography is enough for people to work out what to do, but if not please comment here and I'll add a more definite instruction page/description.<br/></p>\n<p>Level instructions! Because I actually want people to finish this dumb game. Thanks to ben_x for the feedback.</p>\n<p>Level 1 - Tickle the giant by timing your clicks when the white circles match the radius of the blue circles. Think Osu or Elite Beat Agents.</p>\n<p>Level 2 - Alternate pressing left and right.</p>\n<p>Level 3 - Click on the teeth to remove them. There's a certain order to removing them, and you only get three mistakes before it resets!</p>\n<p>Level 4 - Click on the circle to start, then follow the circle with your mouse. Keep within the radius of the circle! (\u00b1 a little)</p>\n<p>Level 5 - Alternate mashing the up and down buttons to lift the contraption to the required height.</p>\n<p>Level 6 - ???</p><p>Hit the 'end' key on your keyboard if you want to skip any of the harder levels. &lt;3</p>\n<p>Ambient background sounds were provided by user klankbeeld at freesound,\u00a0http://www.freesound.org/people/klankbeeld/.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4cf/4cf015883f5966f01c3fc93c4808022a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FIFOgamedev"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
