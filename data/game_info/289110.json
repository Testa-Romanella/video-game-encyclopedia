With the stage of battle firmly rooted in the world of human logic, will Battler finally defeat the Golden Witch?</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>Despite being a crossover, no knowledge of the Ace Attorney series is required, but the game does assume the player is familiar with Ace Attorney gameplay.<br/></p>\n<p>The \"prologue\" PDF is a short story that sets up the case. It is completely optional, and I recommend you skip it if you haven't finished Umineko.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Contains (incredibly vague) spoilers for Turn of the Golden Witch (Episode 2 of Umineko). If you're familiar with the Red and Blue truths, you should be fine.\u00a0 Although, half the fun probably comes from already being familiar with Beatrice and Battler!</p>\n\n<strong>PyWright and Important Notes\u00a0</strong>\n<p>The case is built on a modified version of the PyWright engine, an Ace Attorney casemaker written in Python. It is bundled with the game, and the game will NOT work with any other versions of PyWright.\u00a0More about PyWright here:\u00a0https://www.pygame.org/project-PyWright-904-.html\u00a0</p>\n<p>The controls should be pretty intuitive, everything can be accomplished via mouse clicks. F5/F7 are the save and load shortcuts respectively,\u00a0 and hitting the <esc> key will bring up the PyWright menu, allowing you to configure your resolution/other settings. I would recommend the defaults. The game is likely unplayable in \"single\" screen mode. I would also recommend against using auto saves, and suggest you save (manually) often.\u00a0</esc></p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>\n<p>PyWright is an old engine that isn't well-maintained, and there are some quirks.\u00a0There is a sequence in the game which is a bit unstable: <strong>if you save and reload during the \"revisualization\" (thought route), you will be booted back to the beginning of that sequence. You'll have to finish that sequence in one go.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Also, please do NOT save in the middle of a line!\u00a0Wait until the text from a line of dialogue has finished rendering before attempting to save. Testers encountered a rare bug where saving during a screen shake will potentially brick your save file.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>If you'd like to play the game on a Mac, I'd recommend Wine. It might be possible to hack the engine to work on OSX natively, but...</p>\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>All music is credited in the bundled \"tracklist.txt\", and I claim no ownership over any of it.\u00a0</p>\r\nStory,\u00a0 scripting,\u00a0 spriting (Beatrice, Battler, AA sprite edits)\u00a0:\u00a0 Xak<br/><br/>Beta Testing:\u00a0 Wobbu, Enthalpy\u00a0\r\n<br/>\n<p>Most of the assets are originally from the Ace Attorney series, courtesy of\u00a0http://court-records.net/</p>\n<p>Some assets (mainly backgrounds, sound effects and music) are from the PS3 port of Umineko no Naku Koro ni.
