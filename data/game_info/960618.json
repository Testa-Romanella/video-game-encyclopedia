By holding down the left mouse button and connecting adjacent and identical shapes with a line, you can eliminate them and move your position to the position of the last eliminated shape. Each level starts from the bottom layer and selects any starting position. Once you reach the top layer, you will pass through this level. Every time you pass a level, you can collect an exquisite CG. Please go to the gallery and savor it carefully!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-05-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-12T03:09:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a12/a12dab605833d57ba62913f4582d5280.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["BGS Games"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Casual"], "publishers": ["BGS Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
