(Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. We've used simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery.<h3>\"Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?\"</h3>It's currently also available in Spanish under the title \"Pedro's Adventures in Spanish\". If there is sufficient support for this game then we will continue to release versions of the game to help players learn many other languages.<h3>\"Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)\"</h3>Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but soon we hope to release the game for macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices.<h3>A WORD FROM THE CREATORS</h3><br/>This game is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation. We recommend playing it in conjunction with resources that focus on teaching the nuances of grammar and verb conjugation.<br/><br/>ROCKET BOY GAMES is an independent games studio with the objective of providing fun alternatives to your language learning experience.
