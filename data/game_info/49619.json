You find yourself in a familiar yet obscure house and must find your way... but it won't be easy, nor are you alone in this haunted dream house.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe game-play consist of text-base interaction, what this means is you type what you do in the game. <br/>\r\nThe objective is to make it out of the Haunted Dream House by exploring and uncovering it's mysteries. This is also a bit of a puzzle or brain-teaser game as the player must have good attention to details and awareness of their environment to proceed. Also, avoid letting any of the ghosts catch you! <br/>\r\nIt will not be easy.<br/>\r\nThere are also addition quirks and bonuses the play can achieve, such as finding all the hidden Salt collectibles, burning the remains of the ghost, and banishing all 13 ghosts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe controls are simple. You use the Arrow-Keys on your keyboard to move, and can type at anytime. Pressing enter initiates the command of what ever you typed. So if you are near an intractable object such as a Door and type any of the following commands \"Open\", \"Open Door\", you will interact with said Door to jump to the next room.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:03:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b3d/b3d2451025d207a4b429c30175cf3d46.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Must Imagine Entertainment"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Must Imagine Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
