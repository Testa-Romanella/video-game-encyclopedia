You decided to play 3 puzzle games at once, because with great power comes great tomfoolery.\r\nOverview\r\n<p>Multistak (a portmanteau of \u201cmultitask\u201d and \u201cstack\u201d) is a puzzle game in which you juggle up to 3 playfields in a hectic game of Tetris. There is only 1 Next Queue between them, and inactive playfields play at 1/8 speed.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<ul><li>Gameplay that\u2019s easy to learn, hard to master</li><li>Adaptive music that reacts to which playfield is focused</li><li>Sound effects that harmonize with the music</li><li>360\u00d7180px resolution, crisp at common resolutions</li><li>90\u2019s tech demo style graphics and shaders</li><li>Key config</li><li>DAS and ARR config for the pro Tetris players</li></ul>\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The modes are called Singlestak, Doublestak, and Triplestak, which contains 1, 2, and 3 playfields, respectively. All modes start at Level 1 and advance every 10 cleared lines. The game \u201cends\u201d at Level 20, but you may continue as long as you can last.<br/></p>\n<p>The pieces are colored and rotated according to Tetris Guidelines, except for the following: 1) The I piece rotates as in World Rule from the <em>Tetris: the Grandmaster</em> series by Arika, which cause the I piece to rotate symmetrically; 2) Spin moves are judged not by four corners, but by whether or not the piece is immobile after locking (i.e. the piece has no empty space to move up, left, or right). Scoring is also its own.</p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Default controls are as follows:, but may be remapped.</p>\r\nActionKeyboardGamepad (Xbox conventions)Move piece<br/>left, right<br/>D-Pad left, right<br/>Rotate piece<br/>Z, X<br/>A, B button<br/>Soft drop<br/>downD-Pad down<br/>Hard drop<br/>upD-Pad up<br/>Switch playfield<br/>A, S<br/>LB, RB<br/>PauseEscStartMenu: move cursor<br/>arrow keys<br/>D-PadMenu: confirm<br/>EnterA button<br/>\r\nCompatibility\r\n<p>This game is compatible with computers out of the box, but requires a keyboard or a gamepad on tablets and smartphones.</p>\n<p>Available on the following platforms:<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Browser - most devices</li><li>Windows (64 bit, 32 bit)</li><li>Mac</li><li>Linux (64 bit, 32 bit)</li></ul>\n<p>Consider donating a couple of arcade credits\u2019 worth if you really enjoyed this game!<br/></p>\r\nMore info\r\n<p>Presented by hai!touch Studios (a one-man band by Haley Halcyon).<br/></p>\n<p>Made for the <strong>gotm.io Game Jam #2: \u201cSpeed\u201d</strong>.</p>\n<p>Powered by the <strong>Godot Engine</strong>.
