{"id": 849088, "slug": "euforia", "name": "Euforia", "name_original": "Euforia", "description": "<p>Euforia is a university project developed by final year students of the New Communication Technologies degree from the University of Aveiro. This project is not an original creation (to know more about its previous versions click here ), but it was recently remembered by this team, which is now trying to develop a new facet of it. In a cubic structure, Euforia is an educational game presented in a dynamic and appealing way for\u00a0young people, making education more fun. A total of 45 images are scattered around the cube in each of the four-game areas and using the Euforia mobile app, the 3D representation of the image in the cube is presented through augmented reality, as well as a question related to that object. In addition, between levels, there are minor challenges for the players. But better than reading about Euphoria, only playing Euphoria! Anyone can do it at the F\u00e1brica Centro de Ci\u00eancia Viva in Aveiro.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-10T02:23:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a90/a9070359f4468104e86863c1654dc251.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["g.martinsfaria"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
