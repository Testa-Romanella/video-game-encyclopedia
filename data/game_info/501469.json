'NO REGRETS'<br/></p>\n<p>I would like to present my game as LineLoop, the game where you are stuck in a endless loop between shifting movement axis. You will need to survive the endless streams of enemies, as well as my horrible sound effects (clearly my strengths are not in that department) you have a special lazer beam that can penetrate multiple enemies and 1-shot them, keep this as a last resort (in case your main gun overheats)</p>\n<p>My main reason for doing this Ludum Dare was to show myself that being \"overly strict\" in my coding habits, shouldn't get me stuck in an endless loop of restarting the same project over and over. Seriously this broke me, but I just couldn't help myself. However I feel that I have learned a lot about myself, and perhaps all of you reading this can teach me even more by being brutally honest in your reviews.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-05T05:14:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d30/d30757682adf19db349709705e234c21.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Squareworx Studio"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
