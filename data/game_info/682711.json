As we've already mentioned, they want to make it as uncensored as possible.\n\nThis is pretty important, because when playing the game, one is going to be able to see the characters and their personalities.\n\nWhat appear to be a bunch of firemen dressed in our favourite denim and battle armor piously does indeed look a bit like the reaction of a guy who's got the idea of wearing some team-branded gear under his makeup.\n\nBut then it bears noting that these characters are all male, not that it's impossible that in this at-times controversial, ultra-violent entertainment medium, there may be a couple of women.\n\nWe know that judging by the video game culture in which we live, there are a lot of women who enjoy violence in media, but passing judgement on such things is like judging the female anatomy by looking at it from the point of view of a man.\n\nDiscuss this story at our GungHo Facebook page.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T09:35:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f2a/f2ae1c223713c27a9aaba72f2c9843f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Outhouse Media"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
