These locusts can detonate for the greater good of the swarm, and they are hungry. Locust Blast is a physics-based puzzle game, the goal of the game is to reach the apple within the designated number of locusts available. If you cannot reach the apple within 4 locusts and the allotted time, it is game over. This game was created in 2 months using C# and the Unity Engine.</p><p>Developers Note:\u00a0Hey guys, this is my first project for college which has taken up 2 months of my life.
