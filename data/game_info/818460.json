Ok, maybe it's not exactly obvious, but now it is!</p>\n<strong>Score Some Points</strong>\n<p>There are two ways to score points.<br/></p>\n<p>1) Break some bricks, you bad ass!</p>\n<p>2) Pass through a <strong>red square</strong>... yes, they're just plain old <strong>red\u00a0 square</strong>. They only appear for a few beats, then reappear somewhere else a few beats later. Be Fast!</p>\n<strong>Movement</strong>\n<p>At your disposal, you have three abilities that can help you move about.<br/></p>\n<p>1) Jump... I know, I know! you would never have expected that! Well, I pulled out all the stops for this one! Have at it!<br/></p>\n<p>2) Dash... Kinda like jumping, but you build up a little strength and, upon releasing the Dash button you almost teleport in the direction you're pointing. If you're not pointing in a direction, you're not going to go anywhere. If you hit a brick while doing a Dash, you'll do some damage to the brick... maybe even break it?<br/></p>\n<p>3) Wall Grab... While in the air, if you move against a wall, you'll grab it. You're a bit sticky ( hmmm... -_- ) so you'll need to jump again to get off.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This game was made by Bryan Miller ( ObsidianBlk ) for the Godot Wild Jam #47<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T10:31:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/75f/75fedc3e7a9f39d4f2f3ec396f19a68e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ObsidianBlk"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
