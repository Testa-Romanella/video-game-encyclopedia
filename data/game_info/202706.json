The talk is called How to Survive in Gamedev for Eleven Years Without a Hit and is available to watch on youtube</p>\n<p>Now the game itself doesnt have much to do with the talk, but Jake Birkett's company is called grey alien games and he has made alot match three games. I figured i could do something different with that theme and genre</p>\n<p>Maybe someday ill use my twitter @LakeshoreGames</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31f/31f7fd1a67deb1ba0fad828dd6db7beb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["LakeshoreGames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
