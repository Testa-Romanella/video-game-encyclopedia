It is actually the remake of the game Nocturne created using RPG Maker 2000 way back in 2002. The differences between the two include new graphics and a new battle system, with only the story virtually unchanged. This version serves as the <strong>English version </strong>of Nocturne: Rebirth. It is also my second game translation after Seraphic Blue.</p><p>Nocturne: Rebirth is notable for</p><p>- A highly original ATB battle system</p><p>- Touch-based enemy encounters</p><p>- Slick battle animations</p><p>- A highly versatile character levelling system via skill upgrades</p><p>- Unique Familiar Summon System</p><p>- Almost 100% custom graphics</p><p>- Characters that players can sympathize with</p><p>- Unique soundtracks</p><p>and so much more!</p><p>You can view playthroughs of this game below:</p><p>Fragbug (Boss Only Playthrough)</p><p>Fragbug (New Game + Full Playthrough)</p><p>serenitycrystal</p><p>And for the curious, here's the TVTropes page of Nocturne: Rebirth (thanks Bugfragged for creating the page!).</p><p>Also, check out my alternative Tumblr site for my translated games here.</p><p>And to top it off, have a go at listening to OSTs of the game here.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/32c/32ce612b555146a2ae85466119c9318e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 217, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["eplipswich"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
