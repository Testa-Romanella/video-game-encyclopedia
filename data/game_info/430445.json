Talk to her and choose what to say, usually. She depends on you.<br/>You choices matter, but don't get too attached. She's only experimental.<br/>Due to her limitations, she is only able to speak in text, but there's enough differing content for you to talk to her for potentially hours if you choose to find it all. She doesn't remember at first, after all.<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><ul><li>Enough content to repeatedly interact with her over and over and over again. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do, after all.<br/></li><li>Enough story to learn about her almost completely. As long as you don\u2019t leave.<br/></li><li>She\u2019ll change how she looks for you.<br/></li><li>She\u2019ll remember you. Eventually.<br/></li><li>She depends on you.<br/></li><li>Everyone will have a different play through. The chances of you having the exact same play through as someone are literally so low, that it's humanly improbable that it will happen at all. And I promise you, the stuff that changes matters a lot.</li></ul><br/><strong>Controls</strong><br/>Space Bar &amp; Arrow Keys<br/>Press F2 to toggle Fullscreen on and off (Starts windowed)<br/>Press R to toggle the game closing by itself<br/><br/><strong>Credits</strong><br/>Null by: Dark<br/>Special thanks to: https://twitter.com/DiamondAppendix", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-20T04:54:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2b/d2bb32e31076d6d00a8ff3556c46e197.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Dark_Seberian"], "genres": ["Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Dark_Seberian"], "esrb_rating": null}
