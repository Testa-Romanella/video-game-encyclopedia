You play as the innocent hedgehog Spiky, peacefully tucked away in your pile of leaves. All of a sudden, you get thrown out of your home by a reckless camper with a rake! Devastated, you decide to set out on a dangerous journey through the forest, to find a new home...</em></p>\n<p><em>On the way, you will run into all kinds of obstacles and challenges that you need to overcome. You will need to hide from danger, cross a heavily trafficked road, and much more, in order to reach your goal! Through your journey, you might also \u201caccidentally\u201d trigger one disaster after another creating panic and mayhem for the humans and the other animals. In the background a story will be told, so keep your eyes open on both the path and the background, what can you see that Spiky cannot?</em></p>\n<p><em>Leave your worries behind and venture out to find a new home!</em></p>\n<p>This was our second project at\u00a0Futuregames\u00a0.\u00a0The project spanned for 5 weeks, including one week for preproduction.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Team</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Adam Al-Maawali : </strong>2D Animator, Concept Artist</li><li><strong>Angehlica Halling:</strong> Level Designer, UI Designer</li><li><strong>Christoffer Harborg:</strong> Concept Artist, Music</li><li><strong>Erik Forsstr\u00f6m:\u00a0</strong>VFX Artist</li><li><strong>Jennifer Aston:</strong> Lead Artist, Environment Artist</li><li><strong>Lewis Thomas:\u00a0</strong>Lead Designer, Level Designer, Scripter</li><li><strong>Sara S\u00f6derman:</strong>\u00a0Rigger, Animator</li><li><strong>Tobias Nylin: </strong>Product Owner, Scripter, Sound Designer</li><li><strong>Zackarias Nilsson: </strong>Technical / Shader Artist</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fce/fce0b68df22de72fcdf90246b761b5a8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tobias Nylin", "Angehlica", "LewisThomas"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
