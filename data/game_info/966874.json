{"id": 966874, "slug": "tracks-of-thought", "name": "Tracks of Thought", "name_original": "Tracks of Thought", "description": "\nWelcome to \u201cThe Train.\" What was supposed to be just a regular commute took a strange turn after a mysterious tunnel caused everyone to forget their final destination. Where is everyone headed? What is really going on? Is it even a real train? Whatever happened, it\u2019s up to you to step up and solve the mystery. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou won\u2019t be doing it alone either - there are dozens of other passengers on board who all want to know where they\u2019re going. But not everyone will want to work together either. It\u2019s up to you to resolve differences, using a card-based battle-of-wits system, where the goal is to resolve the conflict and find common ground.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe personality of the ladybug is defined by you throughout the adventure. The choices made as you interact with passengers will affect the story\u2019s path at every step throughout the train. One of seven potential companions will join you on your journey, an unlikely ally who\u2019s your polar opposite.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that? A diverse collection of characters to meet, greet, and talk up! Every one of them is an adorable critter, with defined personalities, looks, and possibly\u2026quests! From a shy spider to a real Queen Bee, everyone you meet will leave an impression. Especially if you run into the biker wasps and their gang\u2026\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConflicts inevitably arise when dozens of bugs are stuck on a train heading in an unknown direction. Tracks of Thought is all about resolving conflicts through empathy and communication. Pick your cards and try to find common ground with others to solve problems together! \n<br/>\n<br/>\nWill it take logic and reasoning? Being sensitive and caring? Inspiring and charismatic? Find out what makes others tick and overcome their reservations to continue the adventure!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt\u2019s a long journey to the Control Room (it\u2019s a very long train). Each carriage is a world unto itself, all with their own passengers and challenges to overcome - from finding lost earbuds to instigating a worker revolution. Every encounter may yield new cards and little nuggets of wisdom that will help our Ladybug on a fruitful journey of self-discovery and reflection.", "metacritic": null, "released": null, "tba": false, "updated": "2023-09-25T04:36:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93f/93f5856428a04e7251354b540daa0816.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Tidbits Play"], "genres": [], "publishers": ["Freedom Games"], "esrb_rating": null}
