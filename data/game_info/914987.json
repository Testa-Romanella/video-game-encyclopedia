I wanted the environment to seem dangerous and foreboding, so I made the environment mainly consist of black and gray, with red being used to identify both Red Riding Hood\u00a0and the wolf. The speed up function was added to make the animation seem more frantic, which is where the particle effects come in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-27T05:46:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fe3/fe3f8d1774e7db3fec640ef84cba04ad.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Sceptile517"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
