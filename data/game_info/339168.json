But with the warden keeping watch, that's easier said than done!</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>In seven days, the students in\u00a0the Game and Multimedia Course at the Friends of Design Academy of Digital Arts\u00a0were assigned to complete their small working arcade game in Unity, as well as coordinate their\u00a0game details, features, and schedules as needed to make the production happen\u00a0after 4 months into the course.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For students learning how to use game technology for entertainment or VR and AR applications, figuring out how to plan and run a project is an essential skill to have, especially when building a portfolio and gaining work experience. This applies not only to game development, but also for companies that use game technology for architecture visualization, educational games, advertising apps, and beyond. We hope to show members of the gaming community and\u00a0more\u00a0what students\u00a0are capable of doing\u00a0within a very short period of time and with little experience. In addition, we hope it\u00a0demonstrates to\u00a0those aspiring to work in the industry and parents\u00a0that an education in game development and design can develop plenty of marketable and valuable skills for a future career.</p>\n<p>For those interested in the creation process, check out the link below:</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-05T06:02:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fa6/fa6a0fb424235860a4dda993ba6b2f8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 49, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Academy of Digital Arts"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
