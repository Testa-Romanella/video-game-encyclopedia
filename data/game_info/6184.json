This lack of &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t upset me too much, as I have a real fondness for light gun games and Zombie Crisis 3D does a good job replicating that arcade experience. ---IGN<br/><br/>Zombie Crisis is an intense, finger-friendly 3D rail shooting game for the iPhone/iPod Touch.<br/><br/>Abandoning the &amp;#39;traditional&amp;#39; joystick-based FPS, Zombie Crisis releases your fingers from the difficult movement &amp;amp; weapon control and delivers a new, innovative style that lets you focus on the action.<br/><br/>In Zombie Crisis, a bio-accident has taken place at the Argo Company, turning its infected staff into bloodthirsty zombies. When the disaster is about to sweep through the States, a female mercenary soldier, Dana, receives an order to investigate the situation at Argo&amp;#39;s lab.
