Every morning Blob wakes up in his own personal cave, eats some rocks, then goes to bed. Unfortunately for Blob, the area he lives in is subject to earthquakes. So Blob must spend most days dodging the stalactites that hang from the top of his cave. Good thing the stalactites have coins in them. A slime has to make money somehow.</p><p>Help Blob dodge the spikes.
