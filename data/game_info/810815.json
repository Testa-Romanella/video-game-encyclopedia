A 2022 16K game for the Aquarius by Roy Templeman. Your city has been invaded by giant alien motherships, which are launching alien fighters that are attacking your city! You must stop your city from being destroyed! Shoot the alien fighters before they destroy too much of your city. Avoid being shot by alien fire, and don't crash in to the alien fighters. Shoot the fighters, and if they leave behind a token, then shoot that to extinguish some of the city fires. You gain points and energy for every fighter you shoot, but lose energy for every city fire. If too much of your city is in flames, then your game is over.
