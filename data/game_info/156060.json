He has been rebooted only to find that the factory where he used to work has been abandoned and frozen over. Determined for answers he must navigate through a series of rooms by solving puzzle block mechanics. Each room is locked by a door that only opens when the corresponding switch is pressed. Sprocket manned only with his ability to push, must interact with ice blocks to move them onto the door switch. As he gets deeper into the factory, the puzzle complexity increases.</p><p>Andy Sze.
