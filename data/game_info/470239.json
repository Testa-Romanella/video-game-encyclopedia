In other levels there is more vertically and the paths are getting more narrower so you need to be flexible to be able to push off all barrels.</p>\n<p>Everytime the player successfully wins the level than his/her best time gets saved to the leaderboards. There is a local best time and a leaderboard time where you can compare your score with other player.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-20T02:25:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3dd/3dd1ae222c8dee2299350ff09374d00c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 2}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 110, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Nannings"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
