Of this beautiful world, where nothing wrong could ever happen. But when I got my wish, I realized, the world had become dull. And my dream slowly faded away.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Dreamscape is a 2D Puzzle Platformer, where you must explore a mysterious and abstract realm with only a laser gun by your side. Solve puzzles by shooting lasers off reflective objects, and richoteing them to reach your goal. Explore 4 worlds with unique themes, and an ethereal and retro original soundtrack.

We recommend lining up your shots properly to remedy this bug.</p>\n<p>-When jumping and touching certain walls in World 3, the players jump animation will get bugged.</p>\n<p>-Lasers do not disappear off screen if they are put in a \"reflection loop\". This will mean the sound effect for hitting a laser off a reflective surface will always be playing for the whole world.</p>\n<p>-The player does not come to a full stop after moving, which can make platforming feel slippery.</p>\n<p>Please report any bugs that are found, and we will try to fix them at a later date!</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<p>This game took lots of hard work and dedication to develop, as Jacob Melendez (the lead programmer) learned Unity in just the eight days given to program the game.
