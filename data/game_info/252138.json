It includes the entire range of expansions and promos, including the newest release, Nocturne and the 2nd Edition cards for the base set and Intrigue.<br/><br/>Dominion Adept follows the designer's rules for picking kingdoms, including the Young Witch's Bane card, Dark Ages' many special cards, and landscape cards. It also provides a convenient list of all additional cards and components necessary to set up your generated kingdom.<br/><br/>You can alter the picking rules by selecting specific expansions to pick from, by limiting the expansions picked for a given kingdom, by following or not following Alchemy, Prosperity, and Dark Ages picking rules, and by requiring a Reaction card whenever an Attack card is picked.<br/><br/>If you find a kingdom you particularly enjoy, you can save it.<br/><br/>Don't like a particular card in a kingdom? Replace it or\u2014if you don't want to ever see the card again\u2014ban it. (Sorry, Saboteur.)<br/><br/>Or, if you'd rather start by picking some or all cards in a kingdom yourself, use the card picker to build it.<br/><br/>Dominion Adept is a Kingdom deck randomizer for Donald X.
