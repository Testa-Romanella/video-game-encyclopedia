Made from the ground up for VR, and shaped by all of us together.<br/><br/>Anyland is a blank canvas for your imagination with no predefined stories and themes... it's up to all of us together to invent the world. Build, script, share, collect, meet friends, have parties, play games, watch videos, explore areas, and make history in a new reality!<br/><br/>We are two indie devs &amp; VR enthusiasts and this is our labor of love. We hope to say hi to you in Anyland! If there's anything you need, let us know please, and thanks for being in Anyland!<br/><br/>Please note Anyland is free to download, chat &amp; explore. You also get a free 1-week trial of the creation tools, and after that, can decide if you want to buy the creation tools for one year, or if you want to continue to freely chat &amp; explore. Buying the creation tools will help us cover our server costs, so thanks if you get them!<br/><br/>Anyland has a sibling called Manyland.<br/><br/>[First video's music by Rimsky.
