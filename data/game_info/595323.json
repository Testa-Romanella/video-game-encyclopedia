BUT I STILL RECOMMEND PLAYING THE WINDOWS VERSION FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>Voyager 3 is a... narrative? game crated for the Ludum Dare 48.<br/></p>\n<p>The theme was \"Deeper and deeper\".</p>\n<p>It's an interactive story about a probe sent into an anomalous blackhole in a far far future where human mastered ways to send back and forth probes into those monsters. But this one ate and killed all the probe sent to it.</p>\n<p>You're an advance AI with a personality, that can learn, improvise, be afraid, and love. And you're leaving your human company for a terrible danger.</p>\n<p><strong>Small Post mortem</strong></p>\n<p>The attempt initially was to make a compo version but a really annoying bug pushed me to release it as a jam project. So that's why the designs are really primitive.</p>\n<p>I want to try myself at narratives game, and I saw an opportunity here. Unfortunately, the construction of a Node-&gt;Question system with event and phase and chapters and stuff, took me longer than I thought (mainly because of stupid code-design errors I made at the start of the project. I ended up stuck and unable to construct the story for most of the second day, contrary of what was planed.</p>\n<p>And it show. The story, which I wanted to be about death and love and sorrow is now just almost a parody of a bad SF movie. Well, live and learn. At least the system I ended up with, in term of event/nodes was, yes perfectible (especially no QOL is there for the phase of writing the node themselves), but at the end the \"engine\" of it was\u00a0really satisfying to see work properly.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll like it anyway as an attempt to the genre. And I promise, I'll do better next time.</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0----\u00a0\u00a0CHANGELOG 2021/04/27 :\u00a0 ----</strong><br/></p>\n<ul><li>Decreasing by half the difficulty of the game (what's the point of making a narrative game if nobody pass half of it).\u00a0</li><li>Adding a quick difficulty selection mode (mostly for debug purposes)</li></ul>\n<p>You can still find the \"release\" version, aka the one posted at 3am at the end of the jam but I advise you to play the patched version if you want at least to get some fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T13:24:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b74/b74c0460e565a324cd91e5bb5dd06338.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Captain Nakou"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
