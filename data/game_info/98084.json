I was sorry to learn there was such need at all, but I was also glad to contribute to the colony's safety.<br/>\r\n\tHere you'll experience quite an unusual way of training your defensive skills.<br/>\r\n\tGood luck, and remember: always defend, never offend.<br/></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT IS THIS?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>KOG</strong> is an arcade and frantic game. The basic concept it is built around is that the player has to catch moving objects before they cross the field bounds. The mechanics require sharp eye and quick reflexes, and become familiar quickly.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>QUICK REFERENCE CARD</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n(For more details, please refer to the included manual.)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tMINIMUM: 500 MHz CPU \u00b7 32 bit graphics card \u00b7 16 bit sound card \u00b7 20 MB RAM \u00b7 9 MB disk \u00b7 32 bit binaries support \u00b7 <strong>AmigaOS 4.1</strong> / <strong>Windows XP</strong><br/>\r\n\tRECOMMENDED: 800 MHz CPU<br/>\r\n\tOPTIONAL: joypad\r\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE SAGA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>KOG</strong> is part of a saga that, as of writing, includes five different games.<br/>\n<strong>BOH</strong> opens the story, with the <strong>Evil Masters</strong> bringing chaos to <strong>Earth</strong>. <strong>Huenison</strong> focuses on the fight against one of them, the eponymous character. Eventually the Evil Masters were repelled, but, as seen in <strong>QUOD INIT EXIT IIm</strong>, during their retreat, Huenison and his companions happened to pass by planet <strong>Suinio</strong> and decided to cause trouble there as well. In <strong>MAH</strong>, years later, the danger came from the <strong>Apocalypser</strong>, the weapon that had been developed against the Evil Masters and that the <strong>Purifiers</strong> activated to destroy the Earth. Finally, <strong>KOG</strong> assigns a new task to the hero who turned the Apocalypser off.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/797/7979dfa669704ae048ef9529957ae841.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 138, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["RETREAM"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
