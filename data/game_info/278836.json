There was an idea to make a tiny minigame of packaging the presents to make them more presentable. That quickly went out the window.</p>\n<p>The final result is what I could code in 3 days - a small rhythm game about presents gathering and grinch punishing. It's functional, but extremely unpolished.</p>\n<p>Enjoy and happy holidays...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4db/4db0d9d2ea535a5652d571e8c39bfb7b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 19, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["psycho_666"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
