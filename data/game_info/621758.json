In the course of your flights, you'll disable enemy communications, damage transport infrastructure, incapacitate warships and finally    destroy the enemy's secret weapon!</p>\n<p><strong>***REGISTER FOR MORE LEVELS AND EDITOR!!***</strong></p>\r\nMore Seriously\r\n<p><strong>587 Squadron</strong> is a demake/clone of Zone 66, a 1993 DOS game published by Epic that I am very fond of.\u00a0 Fittingly, the demake is in Epic's own ZZT.<br/></p>\n<p>The action is quite fast-paced for a ZZT game and may lag when played in a browser (Chrome more than Firefox). For the best experience, I recommend downloading the game in the zip below. It contains all you need to play it on a Windows machine - unzip it to the folder of choice, run ZETA86.EXE and then select 587SQNJ with W. <br/></p>\r\nGetting around in ZZT\r\n<p>To get started, select (Keyboard) and (C)olor after starting the game and then press P to play. Move using the arrow keys. Once in the game, you can pause by pressing P and unpause by moving.</p>\n<p>For more information on ZZT as a whole, I recommend visiting the Museum of ZZT. You can find more ZZT games on itch.io with the 'zzt' tag in the game information section. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T00:04:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9c4/9c4bd60101e762d423125f5a8089b36b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 55, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PogeSoft"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
