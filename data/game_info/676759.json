A place between ambition's east and fear's west that burns in the flames of destruction. The hatred, the greed, the opression generated a chaotic system with emotionally unstable subjects. But be cool. Keep calm and don't panic. The salvation may be in your hands. Or better, in the hands of the conductor of  the orchestra. Only music can restore the harmony and save the planet of destruction. A mission that won't be easy, since the musicians are let's say, pretty unstable with the situation.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T14:40:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2ad/2adc50b3cf198fc49e11cdf8a9e8bf8e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 46, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["ghenriquemo", "mashiro11", "takashi-san", "Jangerows", "carlalaudari", "Bruno Cafe", "Oslon", "Jenas", "Leticia Lunkes", "DimazzMusica", "Rhaige"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
