Starting in the year 2023, you must make decisions about what projects the world will pursue--new research like alternative energy sources, or massive infrastructure projects like mass electrification or space travel, or one of over one hundred other possibilities. Decide how energy and food is produced across the world. Should we immediately halt all fossil fuel usage, or should we swap to a \"transition\" fuel source first?<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>WORK WITH PARLIAMENT</strong>: At the same time you must juggle relationships with competing political factions in global parliament and improve the quality of life for everyone on the planet. Will you be able to guide the world into a better future amidst differing interests and visions?<br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>IMPACT THE WORLD</strong>: Half-Earth Socialism features a simple model of the world: the impact of your decisions are simulated using the HECTOR climate model and a model of planetary production and demand. See how the world changes according to your actions--perhaps new culinary trends around eating invasive species, or the emergence of eco-terrorists if your plans fail to improve planetary health and human well-being.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game, based on the book Half-Earth Socialism (Drew Pendergrass and Troy Vettese, Verso 2022), is the fruit of the labour of many designers, researchers, and artists (full credits below).
