And, of course, learning more about your surroundings with your trusty scanner, Gert.</p>\n\n<p>Outer is a randomly-generated point-and-click sort of adventure, with lovingly handmade pixel art and lovingly mouth-created sound effects. It's made using Love2D.</p>\n<p>Once you've played, share your score!

In the meantime, mac users who have Love2D on their computers are welcome to use the .love file included on my itch.io page to play.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-26T04:11:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee9/ee9a3e730b9cc41cb6c90569b8a57b39.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["kristinamay"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
