But as he peers out of the window to see the source, the singing woman takes off into the distance on her horse. Her red neckerchief blows loose in the wind and falls to the dirt outside of the saloon.\u00a0The man borrows a growing horse from the stables to find her, return the neckerchief, and\u00a0hear her voice once again. His journey may be foolish. But blind love makes people do the strangest things.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:17:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/97f/97f5584f776598e9bca0604878723381.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Kaleido"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
