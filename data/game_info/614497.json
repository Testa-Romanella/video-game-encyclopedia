I like the ones that have both sides as humanoids\u00a0 rather than one giant versus player. While it looks fantastic, I think it leads to some sluggish combat.</p>\n<p>My goal was to have an agile player controller and agile boss AI. If everything works properly, it should create a fight that is dependent on your skills and progresses as you play.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Inspiration for Player Controller: </strong>The best character controller I have ever used was Warframe. It is also one of my favourite games, don't play it though. It is a trap. It is a game that includes space ninjas and their movement set is just fantastic. I tried to recreate that feeling in here as much as possible. If you played Warframe, you should feel at home.</li><li><strong>Inspiration for Boss AI:</strong> My main guide for this AI was Knight Artorias from Dark Souls. It is a humanoid and his movement behaviour is quite agile. I don't think I managed to replicate it properly.\u00a0 But I implemented a certain scenarios that would assist the player's move set. The boss should be able to close/elongate the distance between you as it wishes.\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>CONTROLS\u00a0</strong>--------\r\n</p>\n<p>Although it is limited, there is gamepad support for fighting.</p>\n\n\n<p>--------\u00a0<strong>USED ASSETS\u00a0</strong>--------\r\n</p>\n<p>Other than the land we fight on, I didn't do any art stuff for this jam.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am listing all of the art assets that I used for developing this project.</p>\n<p>SYNTY Polygon Prototype\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/polygon-prototype-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-137126\r\n</p>\n<p>Clazy Runner Animation Package\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/runner-action-animation-pack-153906\r\n</p>\n<p>Powerful Sword Animation Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/powerful-sword-pack-great-sw...\r\n</p>\n<p>Brute Force Grass Shader\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/brute-force-grass-shader-19238...\r\n</p>\n<p>Jupiter Low Poly Procedural Sky\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/procedural-sky-b...\r\n</p>\n<p>Ultimate Game Music Collection\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/ultimate-game-music-collection-37351\r\n</p>\n<p>Cafofo - Footsteps Sound Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/foley/footsteps-sound-pack-...\r\n</p>\n<p>Blue\u00a0SKY GUI Pack\r\n</p>\n<p>https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/gui-kit-bluesky-177699</p>\n\n<p>I hope you like the game :)</p>\n<p>Have a good and healthy day!</p>\n<p>ahmetahaydemir\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-07T07:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c31/c31149472e26d2166bbc1a5bdbb477ce.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 147, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["ahmetahaydemir"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
