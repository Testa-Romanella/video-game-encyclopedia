Since this was my first Game Jam and I am a one man team, I think I did pretty good though. I'll be doing a lot more planning next time.</p>\n<p>To play, click on the cards on the right and place them on the board. You can then click on the cards to move them around and try to find the enemy card with a crown. Fair warning, it's pretty buggy.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was supposed to be similar to Stratego, where your cards can beat the enemy's cards if they have a higher number. However, value on the enemy's cards are hidden until they are used to attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The twist for my game was that the value on the cards was based on a dice roll. When you attack, the value gets locked in. I also played around with the idea of a locked in defense. The number on the drawn cards corresponds to the number rolled by the dice, which was possibly going to be a defense mechanic or something.</p><p>Graphics and sound are entirely from Kenney.nl.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T18:32:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b03/b036483202ee19d21a24913a21461105.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["BirdLogics"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
