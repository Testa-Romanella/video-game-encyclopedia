Soldiers cannot be replaced.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Move your teams to locations to have them collect scrap to be turned into supplies when returned to your HQ. The longer you stay in a location, the more attention you attract.</p>\n<p>Your teams will suffer mechanical malfunctions, especially when on the move. If they have supplies, they will repair these malfunctions. If not, the machine will be lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The HQ can only process so much material at a time. A constant stream of supplies is more effective than delivering a huge amount and having to wait.</p>\n<p>Left click to select units, then click on a location. Right clicking a unit provides details. Escape closes windows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong>: -\u00a0 <em>All listed controls\u00a0can be remapped in-game.</em></p>\n<p>WASD - Pan the map</p>\n<p>H - Home the map</p>\n<p>Escape - Close interface menus. Open main menu</p>\n<p>Middle Mouse - Drag map</p>\n<p>Space - End Turn</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This version of the game will not be updated, as it is a Ludum Dare submission. Future additions in another branch will likely be restricted to inclusion of recorded voice acting that was not implemented in time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Please do not use the windowed version unless the game does not work on your display. It is not supported, and delivers an unintended experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks, and let us know what you think.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T13:04:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6da/6dabdd2bf2766b01966c0c433e5bb7bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["trenchmouth"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
