Almost all bands have lost their motivation and ability to play...all but one! System of a Down is the only group standing between saving heavy metal and succumbing to the goddesses like the rest. Do you have what it takes to help System save metal?<br/>\tThe game lies somewhere between a boss rush and a brawler, sprinkled with bullet hell elements here and there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Team Lead</strong>:\u00a0Nazely Hartoonian</p>\n<p><strong>Programmers</strong>:\u00a0Christopher Dipalma (Character Lead) |\u00a0Ulises Perez |\u00a0Kyle Kissler (Boss Lead)|\u00a0Keegan Frederick\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay Designers</strong>:\u00a0Luke Miller |\u00a0Chase Taylor</p>\n<p><strong>UI and Systems Designers</strong>:\u00a0Victoria Barinova\u00a0 |\u00a0Keegan Frederick |\u00a0Oscar Amarillas Diaz</p>\n<p><strong>Artists</strong>:\u00a0Rachel Lee |\u00a0Victoria Barinova</p>\n<p><strong>Sound Designers</strong>:\u00a0Brandon Delehoy |\u00a0Johan Tan (Technical Sound Designer)\u00a0|\u00a0Chase Taylor</p>\n<p><strong>Itch.io Page Designer</strong>:\u00a0Yixuan (Angela) Li</p>\n<p><strong>Very special thanks to 8 Bit Universe for giving our team permission to use their Toxicity, B.Y.O.B., Aerials, Chop Suey, Violent Pornography, and Hypnotize covers for this game.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-31T04:28:07", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/714/7146055fbd7bdaded31dfe5ea734f302.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 206, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheAvianLord", "Brandon Delehoy", "Kyle Kissler", "CodiakVII", "Naz", "Johan Tan", "Chaseoqueso", "Luke Miller", "Keegan Frederick", "Iffycreature", "InvalidCS"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
