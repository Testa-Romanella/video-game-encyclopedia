Try to predict your opponent's movements and counter with your own in Simulchess, the chess game where moves are resolved simultaneously!</p>\n<p><strong>This is a two-player game. Grab a friend!\u00a0</strong></p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY:\r\n<ul><li>Use the mouse to click and select your unit, then click where you would like them to move.</li><li>Pass control over to your opponent, and don't look at the screen while they make their move!</li><li>Watch how the pieces move simultaneously and resolve.</li><li>Defeat your opponent's King to win.</li><li>Press R to restart the game. On Windows, Escape closes the game and\u00a0F11 toggles fullscreen.</li></ul>\r\nJAM THEME\r\n<p><strong>Who is the enemy?</strong></p>\n<p>This prototype was made in 3 hours for TriJam 51. While in normal chess moves are resolved turn-by-turn, so you can analyze exactly what your opponent did before you make your move, in Simulchess both players choose their next move before either is made, so that they resolve at the same time.</p>\n<p>You must use your intuition to determine your opponent's next move and react accordingly. Think they're about to take your bishop? Move them out of the way so they swipe at nothing! Think they're going to reposition their queen near your troops to threaten your king? Move your pawn to that same location so they both destroy each other!</p>\n<p>All assets (art, music, and sound effects) were made by me in the 3 hours using GameMaker Studio 2, FL Studio, and sfxr.</p>\r\nMISSING FEATURES\r\n<p>As this game was made in under 3 hours, it is very basic and merely a prototype. It is missing the ability to en passant, castle, and there is no feature to check or properly checkmate\u00a0your opponent. Instead, you simply take your opponent's king.</p>\n<p>I also feel like while this idea of simultaneously-resolved chess has intriguing potential (it's been on my mind for years), this version needs work. Perhaps being able to \"attack\" your own troops that you expect to be taken, so that when your opponent takes the troop, your troop immediately takes that attacking troop in response.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps this game, while sharing the overall rules and movesets of chess, is so fundamentally different from chess in its basic strategy, and I'm just not conceiving the game strategy correctly. This game is truly about predicting your opponent's immediate next move almost exactly, so that you can take the troop in mutual destruction.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-01-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-01-10T04:48:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c3/1c346fdeeaa361c381dd391a7bfdba40.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 45, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Gunnar Clovis"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
