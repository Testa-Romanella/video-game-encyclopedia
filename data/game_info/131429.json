It's nothing game breaking, but it might as well need a change in how the interpreter works across all builds.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Very special thanks to El\u00e1dia and Fernando.</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/7732264864c0ae577f336d989a359b6e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Thiago Bastos"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
