When his air runs out completely it\u2019s game over!</p>\n<p>Hop can safely fall quite far, but he will not survive more than a couple of screen\u2019s height if he lands on dry ground.</p>\n<p>Touching a fluttering checkpoint flag will save your progress (your position, carrots collected and the current water level). You will be able to resume from that point by selecting the Checkpoint menu option. Checkpoints deactivate when the water reaches them.</p>\n<p>You can view your statistics (distance to the surface, play time, number of continues used and number of hops) by selecting the Stats menu option.</p>\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>Hop is a Jump King style game but it is actually based on the first two games I ever owned for the Amstrad CPC 464 8-bit home computer: Roland in the Caves (a port of the classic ZX Spectrum game Bugaboo) and Spannerman. Roland in the Caves is set underground and has the \u2018hold down a button to build up jump power\u2019 control mechanic. Spannerman contributed the idea of a pipe springing a leak that inexorably floods the level.</p>\n<p>Hop was developed over the course of 2 weeks using the Godot game engine with graphics created in Clip Studio Paint and sound effects generated in ChipTone and edited with Audacity.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-02T14:35:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be5/be5c375268f96bc26076a645177552d0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 53, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Steampunkdemon"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
