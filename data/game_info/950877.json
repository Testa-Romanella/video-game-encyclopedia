{"id": 950877, "slug": "alakablam", "name": "Alakablam", "name_original": "Alakablam", "description": "<p><strong>Alakablam </strong>is a chaotic multiplayer platformer where you're tasked to use\u00a0spells, potions, and armor to your advantage, defeat (up to 3) of your\u00a0friends, and emerge victorious as the greatest mage of all time! <em>...or the greatest of the past five minutes, at least.</em></p>\n<p>Included in this release are\u00a0five\u00a0potion concoctions, six\u00a0types of armor, and nine\u00a0distinct and <strong>powerful</strong> wands to wield in battle across\u00a0six\u00a0fun\u00a0arenas. That's a lot of numbers! But trust me,\u00a0<strong>Alakablam</strong> has a TON of <strong><em>BANG </em></strong>for your buck--assuming you consider time legal tender.\u00a0Particularly because one of the wands shoots grenades! <em>The rest of the wands are cool though too, I promise.</em></p>\n<p>Interested in spicing things up? I'm not, but if <strong><em>you </em></strong>are, there's a whole range of options ranging from round timers, default health values, handicaps, and probably one or two\u00a0more I dunno.\u00a0Never play the same way twice, because if you do I'll be really sad that I spent all that time making a shiny new option menu just for you <em>and you didn't even bother touching it</em>, <strong>you <em>ungrateful</em></strong>--</p>\n<p>Don't have any friends? Who does? <em>Well I do, but I'm speaking metaphorically.</em> You don't need anybody else to have fun in <strong>Alakablam</strong> though; just start a round and a computer opponent will hop in alongside you to give you a walloping. That, or\u00a0get stuck trying to jump to a platform it can't reach. Does that every now and then. Could be trying to communicate with the outside world, could be iffy code. <em>Potato tomato.</em></p>\n<p>Anyways. That's <strong>Alakablam</strong> for you! So go ahead, try it! Blast away the competition and claim supreme victory as the person that won a match that one time\u00a0in a random\u00a0itch.io multiplayer game! Become the champion you always wanted to be, ever since like two minutes ago!\u00a0<strong>We're all rooting for you!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay that's it you can go now bye.</p>\n\n<p>--- Credits ---</p>\n<p>Programming: Jepe</p>\n<p>Visuals: Jepe</p>\n<p>Audio: Bfxr &amp; sheet\u00a0music Jepe found lying around an abandoned parking lot (FL Studio scraps n whatnot.)</p>\n<p>--- --- --- ---</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-03T17:31:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/93b/93ba5914374e6189f8134d90532b6b0c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jepezz"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
