I'm planning to add lots of things before going to the level design part.</p><p>Controls: ASDW or arrows to move and jump. Left click to shoot boomerangs, right click to teleport.</p><p>For some reason, the game doesn't work properly until you suffered damage. The first time that you suffer damage the enemies will work as they are intended to and the boomerangs will disapear when they collide. Plus the FPS will go up again if you are having a problem with that.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-12-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ee1/ee1c58f977e557c2f33fb014f38f8e18.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Javier Bullrich"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
