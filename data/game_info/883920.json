{"id": 883920, "slug": "speaker-of-worlds-itch", "name": "Speaker of Worlds (itch)", "name_original": "Speaker of Worlds (itch)", "description": "<p>Speaker of Worlds is an interactive movie game. There will be some mini games here and there, but ultimately it is a fantasy movie game. You interact with things, and your choices let you read the story of the game in an alternate way and you'll get personality scores as you are adventuring with your personal choices, that will affect your journey going forward.<br/>Play as one of three heroes in the game. Sally, the gnome mechanical engineer, alternatively Jojo the shadow dancing troll or the human spell weaving knight. Playing as either one of these will make your adventure political, funny or prophetical.<br/><br/>There will be some mini games like seeing how fast you react on pressing your keys on the keyboard or clicking with the mouse on moving objects. Mini games and speech bubbles will give you personality points, which is right now, only for showing to your friends or see for yourself what score you got. The personality points you get are hidden, you will not know which personality you score the first run.<br/><br/>Depending on your hero of choice, you will see the story unfold from their own side. That means that they have their own agendas and personality. Playing another hero will not be 100% the same run.<br/></p>\r\nStory\r\n<p>The story is about a world being invaded by demons from another world and multiverse that has been summoned by the 6 demon vestiges, that use sorcery to welcome the demons into this world by so called \"rifts\" that they can open with by the help of people that has read about the ancient demon sorcery in the forgotten and hidden library in the world Urth.<br/>The plot starts with the hero escaping a prison in one of many human empires in the world. He gets help from the werewolf Hannes, which was imprisoned by only hearsay from the corrupted government of Atrecia. The hero, however, was imprisoned for being the class they are (spell weaver, shadow dancer or mechanical engineer).<br/><br/>You must stop the demon invasion before it's too late.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-21T12:11:00", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/976/97665587262f2c9cefd9b7abca72551c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 58, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mibli"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
