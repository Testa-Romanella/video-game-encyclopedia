Gameplay: use arrow keys for movement and space to blow air. Do not let the ball touch the black squares and don't let it bounce too much or it'll be hard to control.Note: please play on\u00a0 1024x768 because i couldn't adjust camera or UI element to different resolutions. If u know how, maybe u can tell me in the comments i'd really appreciate it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Music and sounds are downloaded from free websites I do not own them.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-01T05:16:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89b/89b6db72bffff4e6763e94483524d350.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["xAmrxxx"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
