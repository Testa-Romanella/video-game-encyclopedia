Each accident occurs in slow-mo, and the camera hangs in the most exciting angles. In Paradise there are two types of damage: if all wheels are in place and the suspension is not damaged, then the player can continue the race despite the damage. If the player loses one of the wheels - a car is considered wrecked and player respawns. Also, all cars react realistically to all collisions: scratches and dents appear on the body, the body twists abreast solid objects impacts.</p>\n<p>Players can both go through the game alone in a single campaign, and compete in multiplayer races. It adds new modes such as Cops and Robbers.</p>", "metacritic": 87, "released": "2008-01-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-16T15:45:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/788/788b80cbc8c39167f7ed6dd89fd398dc.jpg", "website": "https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/criterion-games", "rating": 4.1, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 61, "owned": 1765, "beaten": 421, "toplay": 34, "dropped": 296, "playing": 19}, "playtime": 8, "achievements_count": 158, "ratings_count": 604, "suggestions_count": 388, "game_series_count": 7, "reviews_count": 607, "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Electronic Arts", "Criterion Games"], "genres": ["Racing", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
