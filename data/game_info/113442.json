I decided to make a videogame about the Clock Machine in Fritz Lang's <em>Metropolis</em> (1927). </p><p>Move the three hands with a/s, g/h, l/; on your keyboard. Turn the hands to the lights to turn them off. Whenever three lights are on, the temperature starts to rise. Don't let the temperature reach maximum or the machine will overheat. </p><p>Your shift is 10 hours long, but you've already been working for 9 and a half of those and only have 30 minutes left to go. </p><p>Music is from the film's score. As usual, the Windows build is untested until someone let's me know if it works or not. </p><p><em>(In 2017 I am challenging myself to make 50 little videogames to get more familiar with the tools. I make no guarantee that any of the games are good, but that's not really the point. This is game #16 of 50.)</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/694/694d1170c6bb02972d6fb831de10fadb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Brendan Keogh"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
