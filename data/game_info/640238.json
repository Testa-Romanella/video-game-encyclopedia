The cows were grazing, the farmers farming, the Yak yakking.<br/><br/>Suddenly, a divine creature floated down from the heavens. \"I am the Provalone Prophet. The Milky Messiah. I am the holy cow.\" She bellowed.\"I come bearing a gift.\" With an otherworldly MOO, she turned a patch of grass to a sparkling shade of gold. \"Once the farmers meet their end, to this pasture you must send, the biggest, strongest, toughest cow, that makes the others wonder \"how?\" On this cow I will bestow, a gift that all will envy so.\" She declared. The cows didn't have much else going on. And so the game began.<h3>Description</h3><br/>Farmageddon: A Cattle Royale is a series of cow puns masquerading as a new kind of roguelike. Try to claim the divine pasture while picking up items along the way to improve your build! But be careful: every player's run is recorded, and you'll be playing against the ghosts of every run attempted in the same day, including your own! With a new randomly generated map every day, and all sort of aMOOsing items to play with, what are you WHEYting for?<h3>Cowstomization</h3><br/>Unlock cowsmetic options for your cow hero! A different skin is unlockable each day, or you can buy skins directly. Mix and match the head and body, and name your cow to make an impression on the Golden Herd Leaderboards!<br/><br/><h3>A Cattle Royale</h3><br/>Each realtime day brings a new map with a new layout, and every run attempted during that day will play back at once like a ghost in Mario Kart, but with even MORE destructive power! Can you claim the divine pasture?<br/><br/><h3>Moo's the Boss</h3><br/>....So you've claimed the divine pasture. Congrats! You're the boss now! You can try and dethrone your previous run, or challenge your friends to take them down! Your boss will have the same inventory and relative health you finished the game with! You better be well equipped!<br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-26T02:49:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db9/db907374294668ece09b0aae8c59fbd3.jpg", "website": "http://solidplasmastudios.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 64, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Evan \"Solidplasma\" Peiperl", "Tyler R.
