With a select group of 12 uninhabited islands, they use their magical powers to build bridges linking those islands to each other.<br/><br/>Kahuna is easy to learn \u2013 but a challenge to truly master! Rivals use cards strategically to place bridges between the islands or remove opponent's bridges. As soon as the majority of bridges are conquered around an island, Kahuna marker stones can be placed on that island. The player who holds the most Kahuna stones after a round will score points.
