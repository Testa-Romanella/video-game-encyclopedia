These sleek humanoid robots were ready equipped with LIDAR arrays to make 3D maps of their surroundings and make decisions on these maps using advanced neural networks. The perfect machine for completing any menial work that A.R.G Corperation required, however this assignment was not given to a standard scout unit rather than a human because of its simplicity but instead the extraordinary risk to life.<br/></p>\n<p>In Enter &amp; Survey you control a v4/51 Scout unit assigned with the task of entering and surveying an AI research laboritory owned by <strong>A</strong>utonomous <strong>R</strong>esearch <strong>G</strong>roup with the goal of recovering a package of interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extra Information<br/></strong></p>\n<p>This title was a submission for MiniJam 111, the theme was colours and the limitation was that you were your own enemy. In enter &amp; survey the theme is applied in limiting the colour space to a handful of colours and requiring that the player \"paint\" in the world by scanning around. The limitation was applied in the fact that every time the player scans, objects are alerted to their presence.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this project could not be built to WebGL due to performance limitations and Unity's WebGL build process severely limiting audio and sound effects which is a core part of the game.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-07T20:46:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9af/9af8dd1e29fff5b96b95e1eac11b0f3e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Valley Hound"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
