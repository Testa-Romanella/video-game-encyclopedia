This is also my first solo developed game.

However you also gain hidden buffs as you put more bags (From the humans) on the yellow drop point.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Generic Username"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
