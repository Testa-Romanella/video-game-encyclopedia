The brief was about a game that was on an island: my interpretation was that the player is\u00a0a person that was stranded on an island after a shipwreck. The player goes around the map and finds 'clues' (items that can be clicked) that explain the situation (drawing a GUI bubble with text).\u00a0I used my previous very basic C#\u00a0programming knowledge from the course in university that was running in parallel with this one - I made a day-night cycle and I tried to make a way to end the game:\u00a0if you click on all the items that explain the story, a bed was meant to appear, explaining to you that this whole thing was just a dream, ending the game (coding was not sufficient enough to do that) - hence the name 'Dream Island'.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-23T11:12:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f3b/f3b7e4c0142f516a29d8d91da606c85b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 237, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Martin Georgiev"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
