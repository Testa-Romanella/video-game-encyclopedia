Core Features: Combo system, campaign, tabletop like drafting, arena, rankings, unique skills and maps. Lots of rewards and game elements to discover.Early Access &amp; Single Indie developer disclaimer<br/>Hey everyone I just wanted to take the chance to say some words. I am a single indie developer and put a lot of work into Timbertales. I know there is a lack of quality in some images or layouts. I wished I could have done better, but after one year of development I had to go live somehow. I am very interested in your true opinion and feedback and appreciate it a lot, but please don't be too harsh (I have some feelings left :)).<br/>It is possible to adjust a lot of things and I would do it of course, if there is enough concern about Timbertales.<br/><br/>DescriptionI am an one man army Indie - Developer and proudly present you: Timbertales.<br/>Timbertales is a fantasy turn based hex strategy game. I wanted to create a game, which has the feeling of classical games like Battle Isle, Battle of wesnoth or Jagged Alliance, but with a very unique nature theme and challenging content. In Timbertales you will first have to draft an army before you can start a match. Unlike other turn based strategy games: You will not have to produce units in game. Its more based on a table top strategy game approach, where you have to build up an army with a specific point limit before the match starts. While processing through the game you will be able to unlock more units, which can be used in drafting.<br/>In game we have a classic hex tiled map in an isometric view. You will have to move your units around the map and clear out different map objectives to be victorious. Every attack is handled instantly: You will see the results as fast as possible and you are able to plan your next steps immediately.<br/>Many units provide very special abilities: You have the choice for just normal attacking or using very special abilities, like healing, cursing or heavy attacks.<br/>There will be very unique game modes for solo playing and multiplayer. Let me introduce the features more detailed:FeaturesRacesThere are different races: Vermin and sylvans. Each race consists of multiple units, which are very unique in look and feel. Some units will also provide some special skills and behaviours.CampaignsA story mode for every race in game. Every campaign contains of multiple missions.

Acorn points are the in game currency to unlock features.<br/><br/>RankingSeveral rankings will show your progress through different game modes. There will be lists for arena, challenge and ranked mode.MapsIn challenge and multiplayer mode there will be special maps to play on. These maps provide special optional map objectives. If those objectives are completed different events can happen and will grant you an advantage.<br/>Combat<br/>The combat system is based on the system which is used in \"Starcraft\". This means we have different unit types and different attack types. The unit types are small, medium and large. The attack types are normal, piercing and breaking. If two types clashes each other the types are used to calculate the critical hit chance for the unit for example if a normal attack type is fighting against any armor type he will always have the standard 10% critical strike hit chance. But if an piercing attack type is fighting vs. a small armor type he will receive a 100% bonus which means he has a critical hit chance of 20%. Critical hits will be displayed with a bigger yellow number while normal hits are shown in white color.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For more informations please visit Twitter / Facebook and my website :)<br/>I am looking forward for your support, feedback and comments.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-07-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df4/df46276fae9cffdefd941123baf47bcf.jpg", "website": "http://www.timbertales.net", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 64, "beaten": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 106, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Rainware"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Rainware"], "esrb_rating": null}
