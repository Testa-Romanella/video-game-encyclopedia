This is a learning project for me, and part of that process is seeing how others react to the game. Whether you love it or hate it, I appreciate any feedback you might have.</p>\n<p>I found the process of making my own game to be ridiculously fun and absolutely intoxicating, so you'd better believe this is just the beginning!</p>\n<p>If you have the time, please check out my website as well,\u00a0punchbunny.com, where I post about gaming in general, as well as updates to development on Meteoroids, as well as other projects.</p>\n<p>Thanks for playing!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-06-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/37c/37ce68f3e611bcf84d8f92991b3b8220.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 118, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["punchbunny"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
