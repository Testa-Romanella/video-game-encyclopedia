This is a game for fans of the Puyo Puyo series who like to build impressive chains. Like Chaste Tris did for Tetris, Chaste Puyo allows saving and reloading the state of the game to do things that would be extremely hard to do in a standard Puyo Puyo game.</p>\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with the Puyo series. I recommend Puyo Puyo Champions or Puyo Puyo Tetris. However, since my game can be downloaded here and played with or without a donation, you might try it to see if you're into this type of game first.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-01-20T18:55:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/80c/80c9e97e06aa4dbbd1a9d4b83bae19fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chastitywhiterose"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
