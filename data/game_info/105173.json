To escape, she must redirect lights using mirrors to open up pathways and doors to her freedom.<br/></p>\n<p>So this game was made for the mirror game jam. Everything (except the music and most of the sound effects) was made by me in a window of 14 Days due to me being a week late for the jam (ofc. i couldn't work on it every day and only for a couple of hours every day). It's pretty buggy and doesn't look nor sound very good but i think it has potential and i hope you think that too!
