The five 3D letterforms are air machines. When the colored buttons on top of them appear, the machine is active. When active, tap/click on letter turn air on and shift the rotation direction of letter (air comes out the vent in bottom of letter). Do this repeatedly to rotate vent to wave air toward the fire. The more air, the bigger the fire grows.</p>\n<p>This was created in a 2D framework (Gamemaker Studio 2). The 3D effect was created by exporting pre-rendered animations of each letter using Cheetah3d (three sets for each letter for the different visual states).</p>\n<p>This is my first complete game jam experience and my first game for public release.</p>\n<p>Format:<br/>HTML5 on Itch.io</p>\n<p>Tools:<br/>Game Maker Studio 2<br/>Cheetah3d<br/>Pixelmator<br/>Logic Pro<br/>Mac OS</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T09:18:25", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1d9/1d907768a48d18ee13f734e40979c21b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 11, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["studiocurtis"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
