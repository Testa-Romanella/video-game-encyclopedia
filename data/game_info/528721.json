Iron Henry takes three iron bands around his heart protecting Francis from the witch of the woods.  Now Francis is a frog, and desperate to get a princess to kiss him so he can turn back into a prince and save Henry.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Princess Emma dresses in her dead mother's clothes to use the Golden Orb, the treasure of the kingdom, to call for help.  Her elder sister is clever and kind.  Her second sister is brave and beautiful.  They tell Emma she can\u2019t stop the evil surrounding the kingdom, even though Emma is a True Princess and has golden magic.<br/><br/>Emma steals the Golden Orb but Frog, fleeing the witch, makes her drop it in the well.  He promises he\u2019ll get it back for her for a kiss.  Emma refuses to kiss a frog because if she does, she will have to marry him.  So Francis tricks her into accepting him as her pet.  Then Francis shows he really is a prince, and explains she has promised to let him in her room, so she will have to marry him.  And when they\u2019re married, she will have to kiss him.  So she might as well kiss him now!
