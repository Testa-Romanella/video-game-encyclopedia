The Vikings of the north became revered as the greatest of all the worlds' warriors, a people sworn to fight until the day they died. In the midst of the chaos a two factions stood above all others, the Wolf-Manes of the East and the Stag-Horns of West. In the year 1036 AD the two mighty clans clashed each led by a Viking warlord. The Viking warlords Balgruuf of the Stag-Horns and Olaf of the Wolf-Manes meet in battle. Their skills were so evenly matched at the end of the battle neither Balgruuf nor Olaf were left standing. Upon their death they were to be given their final resting place in the kingdom of Valhalla; however, the constant warring of the land leaves little room for new entry, forcing the two Viking warlords to fight each other in one last battle as they climb the stairs of Valhalla.</p><p><strong>CREDITS</strong></p><p><strong>Management</strong></p><p>Producer- Christian Boyette</p><p>Lead Designer - Christian Boyette</p><p>Lead Artist - Jack Banta</p><p><strong>Art</strong></p><p>Character Artist / Animator - Jack Banta</p><p>Environmental Artist - Matt Young</p><p>Environmental Artist - Alec Pacquin<br/></p><p>Environmental Artist - Jack Banta</p><p><strong>Programming</strong></p><p>Level Mechanics Programmer - Christian Boyette</p><p>Player Mechanics Programmer - Christian Boyette</p><p>Menu System Programmer - Steven Mangold </p><p><strong>  Level Design</strong></p><p>Level Designer - Christian Boyette</p><p><strong>(IDEAL) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Processor: 3.5 GHz Intel Core i5</p><p>Operating System: Windows XP or higher</p><p>Memory: 8 GB DDR3</p><p>Storage: 1024 GB 7200 rpm</p><p>Graphics: NVIDIA Geforce 7800 GT or ATI Radeon x1950 Pro</p><p>Other: Two USB 3 ports<br/></p><p><strong>Plays with two Xbox 360 controllers</strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-02-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4e8/4e895c23ed43fde3100ac0d52caff57f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 146, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["keyward"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
