{"id": 319970, "slug": "how-was-your-day", "name": "How Was Your Day?", "name_original": "How Was Your Day?", "description": "<p>\"How Was Your Day?\" Is a platformer where you play through the hazy recollection of a business man's day as he recalls it to his wife, filling in the fuzzy spots of his blurred memories in interesting ways.</p>\n<p>Each level is set further and further into his time at his company, starting at day 1 and jumping a month ahead with every level after.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The goal of the game is to get the fuzzy headed business man's project to the desk of the person he needs to look it over for every step of its development. Pushing it through his cluttered office, dropping it off at the middle men for approval and several other hazards to his work.</p>\n<p>This game is built around the theme of a routine, like how after months of walking a route your mind starts skipping around when you got to what landmark as you try to recall it. As you start to slip into his routine over the short time you have with him, you will begin to master the ways of the business man's life. <br/></p>\n<p>Level Design and Art by Robert Martindale (Myself)</p>\n<p>Programming and building blocks by AET 318<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-09", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:45:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/11a/11acee5a5a10193bccdcf483f7bc1f9a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robert_SM"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
