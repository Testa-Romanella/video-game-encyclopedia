In this jam, you only have 3 hours to actually work on your project.\u00a0I decided to go for a fast-paced driving game where you (not being the \"best\" cop) run down criminals. Think about GTA but with a police car going rogue :)</p>\n<p>I might have been inspired by the disturbing violence from police against harmless indivduals. Maybe that inspired the game a little bit...anyway...</p>\n<p>I wanted to use this jam to experiment with simpler colors and a \"stylized look\". Ofc in the end, I had no time to experiment with toon shader or such, but will do after the jam. The driving feeling however turned out quite nicely - so I\u00a0 might build upon that and do 1-2 more driving games in the future.</p>\n<p>Sadly, I ran out of time to fix the webGL build, it lagged for some reason, so sadly, you need to download the game...I wonder if 3d games always cause webGL issues?</p>\n<p>Color palette used:</p>\n<p>https://colorhunt.co/palette/220248<br/></p>\n\n<p>Rough outline of time used:</p>\n<p>1 hr Blender (wayyyyyy too long for creating one house model), thats why the car model has cubes for wheels and the criminals are 2 cubes.</p>\n<p>1.5hr coding &amp; setting up level in unity</p>\n<p>20min music in Magix Music Maker and recording an OOF sound :D</p>\n<p>Rest of time compiling.</p>\n<p>Fun fact I've learned: if you use ToString(\"C2\") to convert a float to a string, it adds the currency symbol, whereas if you do ToString(\"F2\") it cuts off the float after two decimals. Would be weird to count time as a currency...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-05-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-05-10T08:31:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b75/b757c495c318d43b7195cea9eee584d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["misterG420"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
