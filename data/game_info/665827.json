Will you be the hero of the day? Be the brave Pilot and lead the aircraft through the menacing stormy skies. Play as the crafty Engineer and pay close attention to the surroundings.\r\n<p><em>This is the prototype of a game developed within research work. Gameplay is based on the collaboration between two players who play asymmetric roles.\u00a0One role (the Pilot) implies an entirely auditory challenge (blind accessible)\u00a0and the other (the Engineer) implies a visual challenge. The game was designed as an inclusive game experience for players with mixed visual abilities.</em>\n</p>\r\nSafe flights!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:48:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cb3/cb3b5d55a524405c9fbb9ca7b63f383a.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tech & People - Inclusive Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
