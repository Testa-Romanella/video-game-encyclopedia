Any kind of level, without worry of quality or how your level would measure up against others! With 30 total maps, this far exceeded my expectations for entries. I hope you all enjoy experiencing playing this as much as I did working on this! Please avoid spoiling anything in your posts. This got way more secrets than anticipated, so put secret/finale discussion in spoilers. Please try to avoid giving flat-out directions to everything too, unless if asked for.</p>\n<p>Back of the box phrases:</p>\n<pre><code>30 levels in total from 25 different contributors, with 1 final boss map, 2 secret maps, and a hub map!  \nProgress tracking via emblems, so that you can put it down and finish it later!  \nSpecial netgame attention!
