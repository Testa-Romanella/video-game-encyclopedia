All of the game assets were created by myself with the feedback of peers and mentors. Kageboshi was programmed in Game Maker Studio 2, over a period of part-time development in three months. The intended design of Kageboshi is that it is suppose to trigger satisfaction when you shred down enemies and watch them explode as they die, as well as acquiring upgrades when they drop and earning extremely high high-scores.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem requirements:\r\n<ul><li>OS:\u00a0Windows: 7, 8 and 10.</li><li>Processor: 2GHz</li><li>Memory: 2GB</li><li>DirectX 11</li><li>Storage space: 5MB</li></ul>\r\n\r\nGet in touch:\r\nEmail:\u00a0rampilowreal@gmail.com\u00a0<br/>YouTube:\u00a0RampilowGames<br/>Twitter:\u00a0@ZS_Ramp<br/>Anywhere else: Rampilow", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-06-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-06-21T04:43:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7eb/7eb718584ae1b48e5013717763e9104f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Rampilow"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
