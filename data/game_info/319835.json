We were supposed to use such a game as our primary influence, retaining its core play dynamics, but modernizing both the game mechanics and the visual style to create a new overall experience. We chose Ghosts \u2018n Goblins, which was a Run and Gun platformer.</p>\n<p><strong>VISUAL ARTS\u00a0<br/></strong><em>- Xandra van Antwerpen\u00a0<br/></em><em>-\u00a0Jasper Klaus\u00a0<br/></em><em>-\u00a0C\u00e9line Vu\u00a0<br/></em><em>-\u00a0Kayleigh de Haan\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><strong>PROGRAMMING<br/></strong><em>-\u00a0Rodolfo Fava<br/>-\u00a0Willem Venema<br/>-\u00a0Darin de Vries<br/>-\u00a0Arjan Kuijpers</em><br/><strong><br/>DESIGN\u00a0<br/></strong><em>-\u00a0Pepijn van Duijn\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0Dominick Langenberg\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0Nathan van den Berg<br/>-\u00a0Joris van Hamersveld\u00a0<br/>-\u00a0Floyd Krielaart</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-05-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-05-17T06:11:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f1e/f1e0b3dd17b05c796248d435180e921b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 233, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["IGAD Breda University of Applied Science"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
