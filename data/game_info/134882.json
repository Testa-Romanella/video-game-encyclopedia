I played around with the format a bit, but if you play Mode 1 you're essentially playing the same game. (Though you don't need to keep track of your score in your head)</p><p>Rather than offering a difficulty setting, I've allowed you to set the game's Speed and Timer to find the settings you like best. </p><p>If you play the game and enjoy it, let me know. You can contact me on twitter @metalsnail or on My Tumblr. Let me know your high score too!</p><p>Music was made using Drum Circle. Sounds were made using Bfxr.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-08-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ed3/ed391e9d024d565e7931ccc8099daf99.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["metalsnail"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
