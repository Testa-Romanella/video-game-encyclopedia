You do this by using the 3D movement space you have available under water to hit a ball and kill deadly fishes. By killing the bosses (only sharks in current build)\u00a0can you advance to the next level, which sends bigger waves at you. Have fun.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T06:34:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a58/a58be98741049057cadd88b1a7acd0e3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["HrOrange"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
