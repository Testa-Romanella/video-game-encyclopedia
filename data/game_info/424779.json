We are aware of the bugs &amp;\u00a0glitches.\u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p>Anamnesis:\u00a0<em>n</em>. recollection, especially of a supposed previous existence.<br/></p>\n<p>Anamnesis is a 3D\u00a0slice-of-life walking simulator that\u00a0takes the player on a journey of rediscovering memories from their life through the senses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The game encourages the player to explore different environments and the visual and auditory experiences that come with them. It is a linear narrative-driven experience; however, the player can progress at their own pace.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This\u00a0project was my first group game, it was\u00a0designed for <strong>Liminal VR</strong>\u00a0who inspire to make great VR games that evoke certain emotions from their players. We used their emotion related research and applied it to our project, we decided for our project we wanted our players to get a real sense of <strong>awe</strong>\u00a0while playing Anamnesis. The\u00a0design process started late 2019 and ended early 2020. The project consisted of five members who all had different roles:</p>\n<p>Producer -\u00a0<strong>Ravina Sahota:</strong></p>\n<p>https://ravinasahota.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Narrative Lead -\u00a0<strong>Amber-Leigh Blake:</strong></p>\n<p>https://amberleighbl.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer -\u00a0<strong>Abi Sanders:</strong></p>\n<p>https://lunahuntress.itch.io/</p>\n<p>Programmer -\u00a0<strong>Jordan Kemp:</strong></p>\n<p>Level Designer -\u00a0<strong>Jordan Clements:</strong></p>\n<p>https://jfc132.itch.io/</p>\n<p>My job was primarily\u00a0designing the 3 different environments that we have in the game, that being the Forest, Beach and the Aquarium.\u00a0 There is a lot to take from this group project experience. Working effectively as a team, sticking to deadlines and communicating well is no easy task. Overall we done very well but we could have done better, next time we definitely we learn from the mistakes we made.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>A special thanks to\u00a0<strong>Liminal\u00a0</strong>for allowing us to work with them and providing us with important research.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-03-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-03T05:13:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf2/cf2e18b7aff39f0788832e67aee8a5e4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 186, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JFC132"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
