A Knight, a Prince and a Monster", "description": "<p>\"Save the Kingdom! A Knight, a Prince and a Monster\" is a turn-based battle in which you must kill the giant slime, Magrait Bonnbaisse, before he kills either you or the prince. As the game progresses, your damage will increase a bit, and the boss' too.</p>\n<p>The boss will attack on random intervals, even deal critical damage if you're not careful enough. But, don't worry! You have a set of potions that will either heal you or the prince</p>\n<p>ACTIONS:</p>\n<ul><li>Attack =\u00a0Deal damage to the monster</li><li>Special =\u00a0Heal yourself and, if possible, heal the prince as well. Costs 10 mana.</li><li>Talk =\u00a0Interact with the enemy.</li><li>Items = Use an HP or Mana Potion, or boost your next attack.</li><li>Do Nothing = Skip a game turn.</li></ul>\n<p>UPDATE: If you get to beat the boss send me a screenshot at my twitter if you want, I'll be making an Achievement Badge for anyone who wants one (better looking than the game graphics, I'll try my best!)</p><p>Twitter: twitter.com/devsmakegames</p>\n<p><strong>Assets credits</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>https://sik.itch.io/fonts - Diamonaire font used for the whole game.

This is the first game I\u00a0ever publish, and my first game jam ever. Even though the game isn't what I originally intended it to be, I'm pretty proud of the end product. If I\u00a0were to work more on it I\u00a0would balance the difficulty so it isn't so easy to just win, add the Defend button, and give more interactions to the Talk button.</p>\n<p>I'm working on other projects that I'll update soon, with better (read at least good) graphics that weren't done under time pressure with a mouse.</p>\n<p>You can follow me on Twitter: www.twitter.com/devsmakegames\u00a0for updates on current and future projects. Send me a tweet and I'll follow back!</p>\n\n<p>THANK YOU AND KEEP GAMING!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-24T13:22:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d5d/d5d5f5da51784dbd28c51286da5abb79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["diegomg93"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
