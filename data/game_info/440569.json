Run away from an invisible monster, relying on visual cues and sound to figure out where it is and how close. Shoot it with your pistol or lure it into traps to slow it down.<br/></p>\n<p>No ingame tutorial for now, so here's the controls:</p>\n<ul><li>WASD/Arrow keys: Move</li><li>Space: Shoot your gun. Hitting the monster slows it down</li><li>Z: Hold to pull objects</li></ul>\n<p>Some levels/mechanics are pretty underdeveloped or didn't pan out super well (The falling boulder traps). The monster can get stuck if you manage to push enough objects in its way.<br/></p>\n<p>Feedback appreciated in the comments :)</p>\n<p>Credits (All CC0 assets from opengameart.org, didn't have time to put them ingame)<br/></p>\n<ul><li>Music:\u00a0\"Night of the Streets\" by nene</li><li>Ambience: \"Forgotten Tomb Ambience\" by kindland</li><li>\"Male Grunt/Yelling sounds\" by HaelDB</li><li>Various SFX by rubberduck including the monster footsteps, monster \"attack\" sound, ball rolling/impact sound, key-in-door sound, monster ambient noise, splash sound</li><li>A* Pathfinding Project for the monster chase behavior</li><li>All other sounds, visuals, etc by Thoof4</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-05-08T04:25:51", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/be6/be66969bbdd64dbb2a600b6f7c24547d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 27, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Thoof"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
