{"id": 358323, "slug": "armed-conflict", "name": "Armed Conflict", "name_original": "Armed Conflict", "description": "<p>This is a combination of a school project between me and friends and a hobby. It's a fast-paced FPS with parkour elements such as a zip line, wallrunning, a grappling hook, and other things.</p>\n<p>The style is going for retro-futurism is is a bit inspired by Superhot, although this project is in such early development a lot still needs to be (re)designed.</p>\n<p><em>Seeing as my main parts are controls and 3D modeling, those parts are the most/only really developed. So far this is mainly just a demo.</em></p>\n<p><em>Seeing as I'm a huge amateur in the programming and game development areas, any feedback is welcome.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>WASD - Walking.</li><li>Space - Jump.</li><li>G - Start/stop grappling.</li><li>Double Tap G - Whilst grappling, reel in.</li><li>E - Pick up objects.</li><li>Hold E -\u00a0 Hold/Use Objects.</li><li>Ctrl -\u00a0 Standing still, crouch. Moving, slide.</li><li>X - WIP minimap/birds eye view.</li><li>Q - Throw grenade</li><li>Alt - Switch grenade type (damage &amp; force).</li><li>Enter - Respawn at the beginning.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mechanics Added:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Wallrunning - Jump sideways into a wall. Going too slow knocks you off. You can jump off and running down makes you go faster.</li><li>Grappling - Simply look in a wall or ceiling and press G. You can press G twice to perform a reel in, where you move straight towards the grappling target at a constant speed.</li><li>Weapon Bonus - If you pick up a weapon whilst it is still mid air, you get a better version. The Deagle gives you a dual wield version, the shotgun gives you a long rifle-esque shotgun with less spread an recoil, and there will also be better versions for the planned Sniper rifle and Uzi.</li><li>Cutting fences - If you picked up a bolt cutter it gets added to your inventory, after which you can hold E for 2 seconds on a fence in order to cut it open.</li><li>Zip lines - Simply jump into a zip line gate to enter the zip line. You get off by pressing E or hitting the exit.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Mechanics Planned:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Health &amp; damage - blaming my procrastinating partner for this...</li><li>UI/HUD</li><li>Exploding Barrels and\u00a0 breakable glass</li><li>Shooting mechanics</li><li>Sound</li><li>Enemies/AI</li><li>Multiplayer(?)</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T07:35:02", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a1/0a14079faedddd4098fc72b5bb687b89.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheMightyOwl"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
