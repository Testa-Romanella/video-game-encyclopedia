It explores the everyday feelings of being trapped in an never-ending cycle, the debilitation of an incurable disease and battling the darkness of depression. There is no pause in life, but we can day dream and escape our reality but soon enough we are pulled away from our fantasies or dreams to continue our loop.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this experience was made to communicate the impact of illness and to possibly help those that struggle everyday and desire to escape from whatever that may be. </p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711c3a528746fce2cfe6521e50b469b3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sey Atkinson"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
