You can do that by adjusting the <strong>RGB sliders</strong>.\u00a0But there's a catch - <strong>not having enough time</strong>.</p>\n<p>Because <strong>I'm a bit lazy</strong>, I didn't want to search for the best difficulty. So, you can adjust the speed of the timer and the precision yourself. You can find the ideal difficulty this way.</p>\n<p>I didn't have almost any time left so unimportant features didn't get in. It would also <strong>need a lot of polishing</strong> (icon, music, etc.). But for the time being, <strong>I'm happy with the results.</strong></p>\n<p>P.S. Made with the amazing Godot Engine. For Android. Best results for screen ratio 18:9.</p>\n<p><em>(Sorry for eventual typos, English isn't my native language.</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-24T02:36:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24eaad7e9d5c49e26fcd428d82f87966.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Voivy"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
