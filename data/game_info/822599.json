When the player clicks the mouse button, there is a large chance that the player shoots a bullet or maybe the player jump and maybe even gain or lose health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The end goal is, well, to reach a high score. Enemies, in the form of bats (don't ask why), will spawn and try to attack you. The bats are very suicidal as they die when they touch you, but you lose health. \u00a0As you shoot more bats, you gain more points, the more points you have the better weapons you have, and the better weapons you have the higher the score multiplier is. <br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls:<br/>Movement-W,A,S,D<br/>Rolling the dice- Left Mouse Button<br/>Pause- Escape</strong></p>\n\n<p>Other Notes: I have not touched a game engine in so long that I kinda forgot how to make a game, so if this game is a bit sloppy, then you know why.\u00a0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T17:17:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3da/3da05ad7e1aba33193f468fe3978d68e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 100, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["asdasdasdev"], "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
