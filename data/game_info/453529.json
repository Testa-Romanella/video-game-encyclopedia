They'll eventually be covered by snow, but until then, other skiers will become scared if they see a dead body.</p>\n<p>Skiers will also get terrorized if they see you (the monster). You can remain camouflaged by hiding inside the forest tree area. However, whenever you perform an attack you'll be revealed for a few seconds. As long as you are revealed, skiers can see you and get scared.</p>\n<p>Scared skiers move faster than normal.
