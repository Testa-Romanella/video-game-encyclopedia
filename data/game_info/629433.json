I have yet to replicate.**<br/></p>\n\n<p>**Dev Notes**\r\n</p>\n<p>Having come across some really nice assets on Itch.\u00a0My Goal for this next\u00a0Jam was always\u00a0to do something in a 2D Isometric style. Having never done anything like that before, it was a\u00a0 nightmare. By Day 5, I pivoted, commented out half\u00a0of the code, removed combat, salvaged what I\u00a0could.\u00a0And turned in into an Isometric Trivia quest instead.\u00a0 Lesson learned.</p>\n<p>**************</p>\n<p>Anyways...<br/></p>\n<p>WASD keys for movement. This is Isometric Grid based movement, so it might be disorienting at first.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>**Added in Continuous Movement when holding down the keys. So it's not as sluggish to move around. <br/></p>\n<p>All actions happen via a Mouse click.\u00a0 Clicking on a character will show you basic info about them. And if you would like to talk with them, you MUST stand next to them and then click to start dialog.</p>\n<p>ANY key presses or clicks will\u00a0\"hurry up\" the dialog and move to the next bit of info.</p>\n<p>The game contains about 20 or so trivia questions related to Balls, or Ball shaped things. Most are simple or silly, some are\u00a0just plain interesting. There's no way to lose, as you can always try again.\u00a0You do not need to answer all the questions to win. You just need to complete the Rancher's \"request\" and then return to the farm once it's done.<br/></p>\n\n<p>*I have also added an onscreen directional touch buttons in the lower right.\u00a0So you might be able to play this on your phone's browser. *Not guaranteed*<br/></p>\n\n<p>If you notice anything broken feel free to leave a comment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets Used:</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>TileSet and Characters:https://gvituri.itch.io/isometric-trpg</strong></p>\n<p>Some assets were customized and created by me to match the existing ones.
