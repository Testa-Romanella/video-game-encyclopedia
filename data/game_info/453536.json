Everything you see was made throughout the 5 days. The Game Jam's theme was \"What is hidden in snow comes forth in the thaw\". I then made a game about bees after winter. BusyBees is about being a bee. You have to go out and collect pollen to give to your hive. If your hive runs empty of pollen, your health will degrade. You can get your health back by giving pollen to your hive. There is also enemy bees who will fight you if you get too close.</p>\n<p>This is my first game jam and my first released game.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Game Name:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>BusyBees</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Platform Is The Game Made For:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Windows<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Assets made before this game jam:<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Everything in this game is made by me, throughout the 5 days.</p>\n<p>The only thing not made by me is:</p>\n<p>- Unreal water material from thirdperson template</p>\n<p>- Grass: Clover Patches On Grass 2x2 M https://quixel.com/megascans/home?assetId=sgmkajak<br/></p>\n<p>- Snow: \u00a0 Chunky Snow 4x4 M https://quixel.com/megascans/home?assetId=ueumdayn</p>\n<p>- Dirt: Martian Barrens Rocky https://gametextures.com/freebies/560215</p>\n<p>Music and SFX:</p>\n<p>https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/ultimate-sfx-bundle</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/></p>\n<p>WASD to move.</p>\n<p>Q to switch between fly/walking mode</p>\n<p>E to give pollen to your hive</p>\n<p>ESCAPE to pause<br/></p>\n<p>When in flying mode:</p>\n<p>R to fly up</p>\n<p>F to fly down</p>\n\n<p><strong>Link to Gameplay Footage:<br/></strong></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:28:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/156/1566b8723d08fda7abdd3edc9b267d68.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 70, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["incapablegaming"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
