Move Mr Swap With Coins\u00a0to swap places with coins. You must make a match within 6 moves.<br/></p>\n<p>Match coins of the same type to create a poker hand for extra points. Gems do not match, they are collected when they hit the bottom row. Skulls will reduce your moves left to 1 if you are next to them when they match. Skulls can be disposed of in the same way as gems.</p>\n<p>You get 3 hints for free to show you the ropes. Then you have 6 more that will only appear if you press the Help button. If no hint is available, the help button creates a bomb. After your last Help is gone, you must figure it out or wait for the cash in button.</p>\n<p>Six Match auto-saves your game. A game can last for weeks, take your time.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:25:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/265/2653ae53f2cc4b7d76cfef18d9601235.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["st33d"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
