He certainly doesn't want you to miss any demons and ghosts, so within the time, click with the mouse to find all hidden items, otherwise ghosts will jump out to scare players.\r\n\r\nEvery time a thorough investigation is carried out and no suspicious points are omitted, the picture will become a little warm, which will be counted as passing the customs and accumulate the completion points of the scene.\r\n\r\nGame features:\r\n\r\n10 different gloomy scenes, each containing 20 hidden items.\r\n\r\nDifferent from everyone's fault finding, it is not the reference and comparison between the left and right of the two pictures, but a single picture, with a wider field of vision.\r\n\r\nThe number of hidden items in the scene each time is random and does not tell the player the remaining number.\r\n\r\nAfter playing each scene repeatedly and accumulating 100%, the button to enter the two week eye mode will appear.\r\n\r\nThe second week's eyes are shrouded in dark fog, the visual range becomes smaller, the scene becomes red, the music of each scene becomes more urgent, the number of hidden items increases and the time becomes less.\r\n\r\nOne second will be deducted for each mistake.\r\n\r\nSome simple and interesting hidden achievements.\r\n\r\nThe rules are simple and there is no language understanding barrier.\r\n\r\nThe process is not long. You can get a refund if you don't like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u540d\u5355\uff08Developer list\uff09\uff1a\r\n\u7b56\u5212\uff1a\u51b7\u7b11\u9ed1\u5996\r\n\u7f8e\u672f\uff1a\u5173\u5c71\u5bc2\r\n\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u96f6\u53f7", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-22T03:22:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e55/e5501ade694463f85a37ad60fffbaed3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 344, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["\u51b7\u7b11\u9ed1\u5996"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["\u51b7\u7b11\u9ed1\u5996"], "esrb_rating": null}
