It was probably the most difficult experiences I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life before, so I thought it would be interesting to test my artistic limits and see if I could express these same emotions through my work. I\u2019ve never attempted working on a serious game before, so this was definitely quite the challenge for me as a designer. \u00a0In the game, the player plays as myself walking through the streets of New York collecting important artifacts that had influence on my episode, whether good or bad. As the player collects these artifacts, I give a monologue on the item and how it influenced my episode and the environment slowly gets more colorful from the greyscale colors present at the start of the game. The song \u201cSunflower\u201d by Post Malone radiates from these artifacts drowning out the background music of \u201cSlow Dancing in the Dark\u201d by Joji. \u201cSunflower\u201d was a song that helped a lot in getting my spirits back up and being able to enjoy myself once again, so because of this it is a main focal point of this game.\r\n  </p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The process of making this game was difficult, yet still doable. Going into the development of the game, I knew that if I were to get this right, there would be a lot of artistic implementation that I may not be capable implement because as a developer, I\u2019m more code/design focused in my skillset. That being said, with the use of the generic resources allowed everything ended up being within scope and I was able to create what I think to be an aesthetically pleasing environment. The coding was pretty straight forward, I knew what needed to be done and generally had no issues with getting anything I needed to get working. That being said, I did have to learn how to code postproduction effects which was an interesting challenge. There was a good balance of both sides of development and I feel I was able to get a good mix of both areas. I think the most fun part of creating this game came from all the nostalgia that came from digging back through all the old photos and writing voice-lines for my post-episode reflections. As for the least fun, it was probably creating the art, but it was definitely a necessary experience to further my skills in these areas. Overall, I think Sunflower ended up being a good test of both my actual game development skills and a test of my creative direction.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-21T04:22:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/cf9/cf94d8fda625954af4894578fc0b19a1.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["vnotgames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
