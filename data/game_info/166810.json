You could <br/>have little to no chests, or an abundance. Many enemies or very little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each time a room is generated the game picks from three themes.(Jungle, Cave, and Hell). This so the game has more variety, and content to offer. Each round is one room, that's how I kept it in theme with LD37.<br/></p>\n<p>I did a lot of crunching, so I hope it was worth it. Let's see how far 5 months of programming knowledge can get me. <br/> </p>\n<p>LINK TO LD37 PAGE: HERE<br/></p>\n<p>CONTROLS - <br/> Up, Left, Down, Right = W, A, S, D.
