{"id": 702403, "slug": "dead-transmission", "name": "Dead Transmission", "name_original": "Dead Transmission", "description": "Dead Transmission is an experimental two player asymmetric co-op horror game made by a single developer.  Play with friends and communicate over apps like Discord to collaborate and grab resources in the alien ship while hostiles hunt you down.  One person plays a FPS horror game in a dark alien space station, while the other is the eye in the sky providing information, distractions, and access to locked doors.  Not only this, but the second player's video feed having a built in time delay makes strong communication paramount to succeed.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T04:43:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/bce/bce0e1f7b34df55108458b206b8c71f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 249, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Brock Soicher"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Brock Soicher"], "esrb_rating": null}
