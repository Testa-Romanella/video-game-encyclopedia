The game is self explanatory, you get to join a chatroom and cause absolute chaos with others. Might sound boring but it's pretty fun once you actually get to do it.</p>\n\n<p>I came up with the idea for this while sitting up all night thinking about stuff and suddenly the idea for this thought up in my mind. So when I got up the next morning I created a new Unity project and began working. The game utilizes Photon because I don't wanna stay up all night listening to my computer running monitoring a server for a basic game I made. Thus the single room the game has can only hold ~20 people, so sorry about that. Enjoy what I did, though.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-06-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-06-15T02:57:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c92/c922e2534147c738cf89ac997dc82e90.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MoldyGH"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
