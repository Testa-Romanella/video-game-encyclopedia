Made for the I can't draw (again) jam.<br/></p>\n<p>In this game you kill ducks. And a lot of them. So, a first warning: Expect blood.<br/></p>\n<p>The map size modifier changes the game size and its difficulty. For the best experience, play it on the middle. The first one is if you just want to finish the game fast to see its plot. The biggest map is HARDCORE. \u00a0But be careful, the beach levels might crash while loading in this setting,\u00a0 so.. you've been warned.</p>\n<p>One last warning: This game have Earapes, so don't play it with high volume.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Arthur Clini, leader of Clini Studios, the creator of Dark Woods MMO, a text-based MMO rpg on telegram.
