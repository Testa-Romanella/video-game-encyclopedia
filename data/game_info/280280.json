Mother Earth is fed up with humans and chose you to prove that they can coexist peacefully with nature. You have been teleported to the three loop world. Each loop has its own type of food that you need to collect. Careful, the loops are also filled with gigantic forest gods that you must not disturb.<br/><br/>The only way to avoid disturbing the forest gods is to JUMP over them.</p>\n<p>When you have collected enough vegetables from one loop, you can use your power to try to switch loop but you don't master your power yet. Thus, you never know in which loop you will end up.</p>\n<p>When you have collected all the required vegetables, you will be teleported to the Breach. This is the stage that allows you to level up. If you don't succeed, you will need to re-collect all the vegetables.</p>\n<p>Get new skins while leveling up and reach level 20.</p>\r\nInfo\r\n<p>I have created all of the sprites, animations and audio theme of Last Loop.</p>\n<p>FX\u00a0sound were taken from freesound.org.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-12-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:18:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/539/539e04c4ccd020891d9169df3c5e10c9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 148, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["Jack Karuneswaran"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
