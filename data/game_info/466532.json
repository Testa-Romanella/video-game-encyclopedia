Flew The Coop was a solo prototype project made in\u00a048 hours using the Unity game engine, for\u00a0<strong>Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2020</strong>. All the assets are original and were created during the jam.</p>\n<p><em>Controls:</em></p>\n<ul><li>[W][A][S][D] or [Arrow Keys] to Move</li><li>[R] to Restart after time runs out</li></ul>\n<p>The game jam theme of \"Out of Control\" pushed me to think about movement and order. This led to the idea of collecting escaping chickens and bringing them into a growing line. The project itself went a bit out of control when I realized how overambitious I'd gotten about 3/4 of the way through. I spent a lot of time creating original art assets, animations, and unique designs for enemies, finding a lot of insipration\u00a0Links Awakening DX on the Gameboy Color. In the end, I implemented one enemy design, cut out a bunch of features, and\u00a0left a lot of enemy sprites and animations unused.</p>\n<p><em>\"If I had more time\" wish list:</em><br/></p>\n<ul><li>UI that scales properly w/pixel perfect camera<ul><li>Show timer</li><li>Show player end point value</li><li>Restart button</li></ul></li><li>\"Rush and bump\" mechanic</li><li>Coop and \"delivery\" mechanic</li><li>Implement leftover enemy sprites/animations<ul><li>Muscle Chicken, \"bump and set loose\" mechanic</li></ul><ul><li>Lanky Chicken, \"transform\" mechanic</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><em>Rest easy, unimplemented chicken friends...</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T13:04:26", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/356/356908ee17eaa6a47d5319305a106c33.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["schoolofmyth"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
