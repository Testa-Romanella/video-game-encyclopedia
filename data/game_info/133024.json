The gameplay of Wuxia Warriors is inspired by classic \"arcade\" style sports games but with the platforming controls of a modern competitive game. </p><p>It's like NBA Jam but with Shaolin monks and the ball is always on fire!<br/></p><p>Matches are available in 2v2 or 1v1 solo versus mode, with two teams of monks battling over possession of a ball of flames. You throw the ball at the opposing team's three magical orbs, stacked vertically behind the team's starting area. The first team to destroy all three of their opponent's orbs will win the match. </p><p><em>Taylor Morris - Programmer &amp; Project Mgr<br/>Iain Lawson - Artist<br/>Adam Battocchio - Programmer</em></p><p>Tumblr - http://wuxiawarriors.tumblr.com/<br/>Presskit - http://collapsingspace.com/wuxia_presser/<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-02-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8fb/8fb4d74813ccc897936e25d244b47f0d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 81, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Taylor Morris"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
