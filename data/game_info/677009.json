Explore, jump and change the world around you with the red and blue\u00a0switch swap blocks. Each of the four areas in the game have their own special mechanics and blocks so watch out.\u00a0Complete each of the four areas to find their respective\u00a0key pieces and escape.<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Switch Swap Dungeon is a Pico-8 platformer created by me, Mitch_Match. This game was made over 2021. During development I saved multiple versions along the way so feel free to play some older builds on my lexaloffle page here (\u00a0https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=42831 ).</p>\n\n\n<p>Menu Theme\u00a0 -\u00a0 \"Like Clockwork\"</p>\n<p>Game Theme\u00a0 -\u00a0 \"Dimensional Gate\"</p>\n<p>End Screen\u00a0 -\u00a0 \"Morning Shower\"</p>\n<p>All of three the music tracks in this game were\u00a0made by Gruber. These tracks were made for the \"Pico - Tunes 2\" project. Please go check out his work he's deserves it.</p>\n<p>(https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=11292#m)</p>\n\n\n<p>Here is a full render of the game map, this is all 32 rooms including two rooms that are inaccessible in game. This image is 3552 x 1472 pixels so beware if you're trying to open it somewhere else.\u00a0Spoilers, obviously. P.S.\u00a0there's two secret smiley faces hidden\u00a0somewhere in the game, try to find them by any means necessary : )<br/></p>\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! Special thanks to my freinds and family who tested the game and to Gruber for letting me use his awesome music. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions let me know in the comments I'd love to hear your feedback.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-08T15:47:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b91194e5db9a64352d087d67f17f1028.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 155, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Mitch Match"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
