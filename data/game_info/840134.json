We planned that make a game about our game and self-development process. It's just a demo of our new visual-novel game and our new game's devlog. We are planning something like this: once a month we will finish and release a chapter of the new story and each chapter will contain 50 levels. At the end of a maximum of 1 year, players will experience both our own development and our access to the final version of our game with an interesting story. <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-20", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-22T12:22:22", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/237/2373ce5eb1a23d3b7708a72cc1e801af.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 75, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neutron Games"], "genres": ["Shooter", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
