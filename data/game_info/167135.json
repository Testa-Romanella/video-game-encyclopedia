The idea was found when I was speaking on the phone with Her. I told her I should make a game named \"Her Quest to find the Perfect Guy\". And later so I did. Making\u00a0 a small yet trollish game. Just for the sake of entertainment! But I am really glad I was able to make this from MV. It almost took my a long time to make it to Android.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-05-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b6a/b6a0cd8e246bef798975ead4d10ad24f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FUNDrake"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
