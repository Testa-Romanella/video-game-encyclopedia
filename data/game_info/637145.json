Three were developed in the land of the Elves, immortal, wisest, and generally chillest of all beings. Seven for the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rooms were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire the quick delivery of retail goods. For within these rooms, was bound the profit and the incentive to govern each race.<br/></p>\n<p>But they were all of them ignorant, for another room was made. In the land of \u00c4amazon, in the fires of Mount Dollarrs, the Dark Lord Beiszoss forged in secret a great warehouse to control all others and into this room he poured his greed, his money, and his will to dominate all life.</p>\n<p>One by one, the free lands of Middle M\u00e4nagement fell to the power of the room. And now you, minion, *ahem* aspiring employee, have been hired to work in our Conjure Corp Central Fulfillment Center, the greatest Warehouse of this or any age. One room to rule them all!</p>\n<p>Try your best to locate and stock goods as quickly as possible in our increasingly chaotic warehouse, without losing track of yourself in the hubbub .
