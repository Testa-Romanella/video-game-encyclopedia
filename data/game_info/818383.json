We still intend to finish it in the future though, so if you're somehow really interested in our game, feel free to come back in a few weeks\u00a0to check it out !</p>\n\n\n\r\nIn Try not to Dice, you use a dice to fight against an endless swarm of monsters !\r\nHow to play\r\n<p>Each turn, you are able to move the dice in any 4 direction on a grid, thus making the dice roll and land on a new face. Each face of the dice makes you either attack or defend against the monster you are fighting.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of all the dice faces, don't hesitate to view it during gameplay :</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sword </em></strong>: Basic attack, inflicts damage on the enemy ()</p>\n<p><strong><em>Shield</em></strong>: Basic defense, adds to your shield counter. Shield protects you from enemy attacks, and is not removed between turns ()</p>\n<p><strong><em>Axe\u00a0</em></strong>: Strong attack, inflicts heavy damage on the enemy ()</p>\n<p><strong><em>Up arrow</em></strong> : Special Face, works with <strong><em>Buff </em></strong>&amp; <strong><em>Heal </em></strong>Tiles ().</p>\n<p>Additionally to the dice faces, <strong><em>Buff </em></strong>(in blue a orange arrow) and <em><strong>Heal </strong></em>(in green) tiles will randomly appear on the grid. Landing on one of them\u00a0will either buff\u00a0you (strengthen your attack &amp; defend faces) or heal you by a small amount, but if you manage to land on them with the Special Face (the Up Arrow on the dice), the effect is tripled !</p>\n<p>Other tiles, such as\u00a0<strong><em>Rocks</em></strong>, that will block your movements, or\u00a0<strong><em>Spikes</em></strong>, that will hurt you if you move over them (piercing your shield !), may be placed on the grid by ennemies.<br/>You can foresee what the enemy is going to do, and in how many turns it will do it. Prepare in consequence ! <br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Move the dice with the WASD/Arrow keys.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can also use the mouse in the menus.</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p><em>Game &amp; Sound\u00a0Design</em>\u00a0: Antonin \"Arha\u00efr\" Voyeux</p>\n<p><em>Game Art</em>\u00a0:\u00a0Battou59\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Barlof</p>\n<p><em>Game Programming</em>\u00a0:\u00a0L\u00e9ana Terakopiantz\u00a0and\u00a0Timoth\u00e9e Fageot</p>\n\n<p><strong>Font used\u00a0</strong>:</p>\n<p>\u00a0Alkhemikal by jeti\u00a0(Licensed under CC BY 4.0), no changes where made. \r\n</p>\n<p>Everything except the font was made entirely by us during the jam.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-18T09:53:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/91f/91f5cdf10701cb652bae4a33aabde6b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Timothee FAGEOT", "Battou59", "L\u00e9ana Terakopiantz", "Arhair", "Barlof"], "genres": ["RPG", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
