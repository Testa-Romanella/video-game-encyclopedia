It's a game... without a point.<br/><br/>Drive over 20 vehicles, and customize with over 16,777,215 colors. Speed around a world over 400km\u00b2 in size, from the depths of the Forest, to the plains of the Grassland, out to the heat of the Desert.<br/><br/>You need to earn new cars. The longer you survive and the more vehicles you destroy, the further you'll stray from sanity... but, you'll unlock newer, faster and stronger cars in the process.<br/><br/>Although it's The <strong>Pointless</strong> Car Chase, that doesn't mean you can't have <strong>points</strong>, that'd be unreasonable. With Steam Cloud integration, keep all your saved progress no matter which device you're on.<br/><br/>These police aren't stopping, and neither will you... How long will you survive?", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-25T04:14:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4ff/4ff8c4f16f3d1b865094cb70a5bafae8.jpg", "website": "https://www.remstudios.xyz/", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 215, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NullReferenceException", "R.E.M.
