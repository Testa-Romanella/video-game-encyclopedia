This was my first Amiga game, programmed in assembler and\u00a0originally released as Public Domain/freeware\u00a0in September 1991.</p>\n<p>The Matrix is a simple game. Use the joystick to move your bubble over the tiles. Walking over them makes them vanish, but walking over the empty spaces causes you to lose energy, so you must find a path that clears the level with the minimum of back-steps. Years later,\u00a0I re-made a 3D version of this game called Yinyang which was remastered and released on Steam in 2019.</p>\n<p>Supplied in ADF format for use with\u00a0Amiga emulators, and in RP9 format for use with Cloanto's Amiga Forever and other RetroPlatform\u00a0emulators.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-08-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-08T16:49:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/26c/26c37d6ce08557be93b9ebce39b2bef0.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mark Sheeky"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
