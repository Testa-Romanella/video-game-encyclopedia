Both versions are the same, just choose one you can unpack easier.</strong><br/></p><p>Game:<br/></p>\n<p>Garden Builder lets you design your dream garden. It focuses on realistic interactions between plants and their enviornment.\u00a0This allows for life-like planning of your arrangements.</p>\n<p>Right now the game is in its earlies stages and the only interaction between plants is the amount of sun/shadow a plant receives.</p>\n<p>Goal:</p>\n<p>The game is a pure creative sandbox for now. Just play around with the plants and see what creative combinations you can come up with. Have fun.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>WASD/Mouse Edgescrolling:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cameramovement</p>\n<p>Hold shift for faster movement.</p>\n<p>Middlemouse hold:\u00a0 Camerarotation</p>\n<p>Middelmouse-Wheele In and Out: Camerazoom</p>\n<p>Leftclick on a plant-picture to select a plant to build</p>\n<p>Rightclick deselects a plant.</p>\n<p>The red trashcan-button switches into delete mode. Hover over a plant (it will turn red) and leftclick to delete. Rightclick or another click on the Button turns deletemode off.</p>\n<p>While you have a plant selected and search for a good spot, the color of the preview shows you what shadow-level you have at this spot.</p>\n<p>White = Sunny</p>\n<p>Grey = Half-shade</p>\n<p>Black = Shadow.</p>\n<p>What level a plant needs is written below each picture.</p>\n<p>Plants that will be effect by the newly placed plant will get a yellow outline around them.</p>\n\n<p>Additional info:</p>\n<p>Sorry for the external downloads and the big size of the project, even for such a small prototype. As it has fairly high-quality plant-models/textures and because of a jam-deadline i wasn't able to improve the compression any more.</p>\n<p>I hope you will still be willing to give the game a try.</p>\n<p>Here is also a link to virustotal. Sad that some people try to spread viruses through this website(sadly i coudn't have the files checked cause of filesize again).</p>\n<p>https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/4abb4f24ca9e08bac09178211af96b6291a0b6455754b...</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-04T10:31:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fcd/fcdd680f355aa5fc5b5daf8550ef62c3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nazzaroth"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
