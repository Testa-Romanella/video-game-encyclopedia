The moon is losing all it's shine and you have to save the night! Jump through three challenging levels and defeat deadly enemies.</p>\n<p>Catformer is my first ever game, made in about three weeks in the Godot Engine. It's by no means perfect and any feedback is appreciated. The game is free and open source with the project files available on Github. All assets and sounds were done by me.</p>\n<p>Trailer:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ-7jcGK_hc</p>\n<p>Source:\u00a0https://github.com/EliasVincent/catformer-simple-godot-platformer</p>\n<p>My Twitter: https://twitter.com/riesereti</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Jump: W + SPACE + Up-Arrow-Key<br/>Move Left: A + Left-Arrow-Key<br/>Move Right: D + Right-Arrow-Key</p>\n<p>Fullscreen: F11</p>\n<p>Mute: M</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-15T05:00:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/317/3177ac6e4a3ec71b6e22fa9339ba99aa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 76, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux", "Web"], "developers": ["Riesyeti"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
