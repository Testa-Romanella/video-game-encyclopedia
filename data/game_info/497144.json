I made this over about two and a half days, so really it's just the core mechanics of the idea I had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea is to hit a \"sweet spot\" shown in green by an indicator above the surface to gain momentum. Too low, and you fail, and once you leave the spot you start losing momentum shown by the bottom indicator. If you go too slow, it'll also trigger a game over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can adjust the roll with the \"a\" and \"d\" keys and if you want a quick restart of the run, \"shift+a\" will trigger that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I plan on some time in the future realizing a full project, but I'm not sure when at the moment.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-25T04:44:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/160/160ea3a05b485705934f7aa9d509bf0b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pi_Josh"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
