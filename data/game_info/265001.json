These pieces represent all the possible ways to arrange five unit squares together so that their edges align. Your objective is to cover the board using the pentominoes.<br/><br/>After you choose a board size and difficulty level, PentoMind will generate an appropriate new puzzle for you to solve.  Your job is then to place the pieces at teh bottom of the screen so that each whte square of the board is covered by some pentomino.<br/><br/>You may choose to have your games timed. Then you can replay the same puzzle with a friend to see who can solve it the fastest. If you quit Pentos during a timed game (or if you\u2019re interrupted by a phone call), then the timing for the puzzle will resume the next time you start Pentos.<br/><br/>Some puzzles may have more than one solution, in fact if you start with an empty board there may be hundreds or even thousands of possible solutions. The sole exception to this is the smallest board which has only a few solutions.<br/><br/>The pieces you may use are initially shown at the bottom of the screen, and you simply touch a piece to drag it onto the board. When you touch a piece, it will grow to a size that fits the dimensions of the squares on the board.<br/><br/>You may rotate a piece by tapping it, or you may flip it (in 3D) by double-tapping it. Alternatively, you may use buttons provided to rotate and flip the currently active piece. All piece movements are realistically animated. Pentos is geared towards ease of use and playability.<br/><br/>Pieces are not allowed to overlap; should an overlap occur, a star icon will appear above one of the overlaps. <br/><br/>To return a piece to its original spot at the bottom of the display, simply drag it down off the board.<br/><br/>You may reset a puzzle by shaking your iPhone/iPod, and if you shake it again before moving another piece but after a pause, the pieces will return to where you had them.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2009-07-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:35:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c6d/c6d1158713eed23eae1da517b2dcc8a5.jpg", "website": "http://www.pentopuzzle.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["David P.
