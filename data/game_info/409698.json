This system is similar to Axiom Verge's sprite system, which I observed closely and then coded independently using\u00a0 gameplay videos as reference</p>\n<p>The project is also a work of collaboration, with a musician named Brian (https://soundcloud.com/brian-mowat), with whom I\u00a0communicated via discord, and shared files/utilised source control with via GitHub/GitHub Desktop.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-02-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-02-07T02:27:08", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/96f/96fae121208da03a3a4eeaac47821079.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamminCogh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
