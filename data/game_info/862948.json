A number of lasers will fire from the walls, and you must dodge them to avoid death. Any laser which is not the same colour as you will instantly kill you upon firing, however you can change between two different colours. Every 10 seconds the room will clear, however the number of lasers fired in the next 10 seconds will increase. Good luck.</p>\r\nCONTROLS:\r\nKEYBOARD:\r\n<ul><li>W A S D\u00a0- Movement</li><li>SPACE - Change Colour</li><li>ESC - Exit Game</li></ul>\r\nGAMEPAD:\r\n<ul><li>Left Stick or\u00a0D-Pad - Movement</li><li>A - Change Colour</li></ul>\r\nASSETS USED:\r\n<ul><li>Kenney Fonts - Kenney\r\n</li><li>Particle Pack - Kenney</li><li>Bass Line 1 - Dneproman</li><li>Laser - swag1773</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T17:50:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b15/b1514ca101e00c201f076768c26cbd43.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Donian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
