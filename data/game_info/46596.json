You control the pins and you have to put 2 of them inside the sphere at the same time. You must plan your moves and make use of the space you've got. If you miss it - you can try again as long as you get it right at the end. As you progress, your levels get more difficult and your skill must be bigger to match it. Good luck.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:44", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e72c404e36e05d547bb1a0e527c606e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Broadplay Games"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Silicon Echo"], "esrb_rating": null}
