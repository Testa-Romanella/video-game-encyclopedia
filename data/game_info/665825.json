Can you find the lost treasure? Be the brave Pilot and drive the submarine through the frightening underwater caves. Play as the crafty Engineer and man the sonar with care.\r\n<p><em>This is the prototype of a game developed within research work. Gameplay is based on the collaboration between two players who play asymmetric roles.\u00a0One role (the Engineer) implies an entirely auditory challenge (blind accessible)\u00a0and the other (the Pilot) implies a visual challenge. The game was designed as an inclusive game experience for players with mixed visual abilities.</em></p>\r\nGood dives!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-17T07:48:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3cf/3cff6076138789b38e1c304330aef16c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Tech & People - Inclusive Gaming"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
