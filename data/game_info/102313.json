Square must find him, and rescue him from the clutches of the Circle of Evil, a mysterious cult hellbent on the domination of Shape Land. He will square off against terrible monsters and impossible traps in order to prove that he&#39;s no square when it comes to justice. Guide him to the center of the Circle&#39;s domain, unravel their malicious plot, and win the day fair and square.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Adventures of Square\u2122</em> is a wacky and wonderful paintball-based splat-em-up for the GZDOOM engine, by <strong>Bigbrik Games</strong>: a company of level designers, programmers and musicians whose impetuous charge is to make things blow up in fun and interesting ways! The project began as an ambitious, one-man attempt to bring to life a hidden world of paint, puns and shapes, but soon grew to become the flagship title of a small but dedicated team.</p>\n<p>Square makes extensive use of GZDOOM&#39;s advanced features, with a unified approach to its level design, art direction and gameplay. Players can expect to find all the best elements of DOOM&#39;s fast and frenetic pace unencumbered by a sharp focus on fun, shapely layouts and free-flowing combat, and with a variety of new and familiar mechanics that build upon this brand of play. The game is made with speedrunning and multiplayer in mind, and features exclusive deathmatch (<em>Square-Off!</em>) maps in which to blast your buddies. It&#39;s the whole shebang, I tell ya!</p>\n<h1>Episode 1 features:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>9 fully playable levels, fresh out of Shape Land.  </li>\n<li>4 exclusive deathmatch maps.  </li>\n<li>All-new textures and artwork.  </li>\n<li>All-new sounds and voice acting.  </li>\n<li>All-new MIDI soundtrack.  </li>\n<li>Arcade style Time Attack Mode (single-player mode in deathmatch levels).  </li>\n<li>Support for Xbox controllers.  </li>\n<li>Support for Mac users.  </li>\n<li>Really, really awful puns.
