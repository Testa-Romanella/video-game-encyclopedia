{"id": 54064, "slug": "stack-up", "name": "Stack-Up", "name_original": "Stack-Up", "description": "<p>Stack-Up (also known as Robot Block and simply Block (\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af, Burokku) in Japan) is a video game released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, designed for use with R.O.B. the Robotic Operating Buddy. Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many, many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by those who are in the know to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.</p>\n<p>Because 1985's newly released NES game console is internally compatible with 1983's Famicom game console, all Stack-Up GamePak cartridges contain the 60-pin circuit board of a Famicom cartridge, attached to a 72-pin adapter like the T89 Cartridge Converter for the NES. This GamePak may be disassembled to reclaim its Famicom-to-NES adapter, for use in modifying other Famicom cartridges to work on NES.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1985-07-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:01:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e5f/e5fc7c8df7e311ee7f8ad5fea39cc465.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "beaten": 2, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 161, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["NES"], "developers": ["Nintendo"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": null}
