And what happens when a relationship has been healthy for long enough? Exactly: you meet your parents-in-law! But what is the outcome to expect, when they are white, catholic and racist?\r\n</p>\n<p>Spend the worst day of your life but hey, at least your girlfriend doesn\u2019t buy their shit either, so\u2026 it\u2019ll make your love grow bigger???? (Oh god, it sounds so lame\u2026)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Gorgeous sprite artwork</strong> by Narcissus!</p>\n<p>The fantastical amount of <strong>40-45 minutes of gameplay</strong>! (\u2026 trust me, that\u2019s enough)\r\n</p>\n<p>Make <strong>your own choices</strong> to make this meeting your own!!!!!! (Like in most visual novels lmao)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> logical, coherent, realistic and well-written <strong>different endings</strong>! (Cause if it were three times the same one\u2026 it would be less satisfying, right?)\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>4 characters</strong>\u2026 nah, I wouldn\u2019t say they are lovely but hey at least Judith is supportive?????? (and who knows maybe there is another character????)\r\n</p>\n<p>A tremendous amount of <strong>really mature jokes</strong>! (A great occasion to succeed in the \u201cTry not to laugh challenge\u201d!)\r\n</p>\n<p>The <strong>French touch</strong> (oui oui bonjour voulez-vous vous tirer une balle avec moi ?)\r\n</p>\n<p>AN <strong>UNEXPECTED PLOT TWIST</strong> WHICH MAKES IT A HORROR GAME THAT\u2019LL MAKE YOU SWEAT (that\u2019s fake news)\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>SPRITE CREDIT:\u00a0Narcissus</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>WRITING CREDIT:\u00a0Yacine Aggoune</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>MUSIC CREDITS<br/>Wingless-seraph<br/>Pixabay (Zakhar Valaha, Monday Hopes)<br/>Quincas Moreira<br/>Sakura Hz<br/>starryattic: one two three\u00a0(viva l'alg\u00e9rie ?)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>BACKGROUND CREDITS<br/>UncleMungen<br/>Pixiv user 2312275<br/></p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>SOUNDEFFECT CREDITS<br/>Zapslat</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Someone who enjoys writing game with soul-crushing plot twists and with meaningful stories. I put high focus on character development in my work\u2026 so what did I make this game? Well, the answer is fairly simple, really:<br/>hehehe funny</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Well, nothing in particular, just what to expect from racist and homophobic people. But even so, the game is written so that the parents look ridiculous, dumb and absurd. Long story short: nobody takes them seriously, not even the game, and their words can\u2019t reach what\u2019s pure and true: love.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-10T16:23:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/70f/70f227a1b4820ca1486fcb77c48ba686.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 132, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["chimeriquement"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
