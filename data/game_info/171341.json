The topic of the jam was \"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres\".</p>\n<p>We decided to combine Rythm games with strategy ones like Checkers.</p>\n<p>Its a pvp where 2 players have to defeat the enemy team on a small checkers board. For this, they have to move to the oponent and fight them. For doing an action, you have to make a fast combo on a rail, where one of the buttons you have to press is the action you want to do.</p>\n<p>The game has a vaporwave esthetic with some famous characters and their dances, like Drake with Hotline Bling or Carlton's dance.</p>\n<p>We made this game to have fun and laught at the crazy idea, i hope we can pass those feelings to you, so you players have a good time with us.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this, enjoy the game :)</p>\n\n<p>Actualization 1: Unfortunately, due to programming errors, we are providing a demo with some bugs and not everything polished. We will continue updating this demo.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a9c/a9ca61be18f4ed663c298e5a02eb261e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 12, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Mesitas"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
