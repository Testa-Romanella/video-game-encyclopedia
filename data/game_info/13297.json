I'll leave the old store page description here.</strong><br/><br/>Spaceman Sparkles 3D is a frantic and groovy action shooter that takes place in a thumpin' disco universe, this time with a mysterious magical space hat of sparkling origins. <br/>Orbit around tiny planets, shoot space ghosts with space hearts, crack heart-gems and get keys in your adventure to save space. <br/>Be warned though, this SpaceQuest is not for the faint of heart. Only the quickest fingers and brightest minds will make it through this gruelling adventure to save whale.This is a short and probably kinda hard game, spinning around tiny planets might make you a bit nauseated. I do think that it's pretty exciting though and I hope you'll have fun with it, but if you don't the refund system is a pretty neat feature! <br/>Hot badges and cute emoticons.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:12:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2e/a2e95eac063c3779f4fd8b340632c403.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 21, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 20, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 232, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["tjern"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["tjern"], "esrb_rating": null}
