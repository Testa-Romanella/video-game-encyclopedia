The player has two types of cards which they can draw:</p>\n<p><strong>Hero Cards</strong>- Which the player can place on their area of the board. These function as the player's health and determine the type of action cards that can be drawn and played.</p>\n<p><strong>Action Cards</strong>- These are the main ways the player can damage enemies with. You can only play as many action cards as you have heroes with a matching suite on the field. Each suite functions differently:</p>\n<p><strong>Clubs</strong>- deal raw damage.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Hearts</strong>- can either deal damage or heal friendly hero cards.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Diamonds</strong>- performs a modulo operation on the enemy health.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Spades</strong>- splits its damage by three and applies it on the target aswell as its left and right adjacent units.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p><strong>Left click</strong> to select or play a card.</p>\n<p><strong>Right click</strong> to de-select a card.</p>\n<p><strong>Escape</strong> to quit.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-12-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-13T14:18:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a4/0a4eb43686a46702a939ece33d8b9b52.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 33, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LBO"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
