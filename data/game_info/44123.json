Supplies are running low.<strong>Day 15</strong>I crafted some basic tools and hunted for fish. Let\u2019s hope I didn\u2019t attract any predators. Fresh water is still a problem.<strong>Day 17</strong>I found a huge reef. It\u2019s full of life and old wrecks. I salvaged a lot of useful materials from the depths and might be able to build a platform, like an ark or something.<strong>Day 29</strong>Welcome to my new home! It\u2019s not beautiful, but a suitable shelter. I also found a way to distill water, so I should be safe for the moment.<strong>Day 30</strong>I\u2019m trying to refine my crafted equipment for further exploration.<strong>Day 34</strong>Another reef, but something is different. The water seems darker here. I found an artifact near a strange stone formation. It looked like a sunken pyramid or temple. I spotted some sharks, so I marked the position for later.<strong>Day 41</strong>I was right about the stone formation, it\u2019s an ancient building. There is a small entrance but I only found empty chambers inside. I need more oxygen and a light source to dive deeper into this labyrinth.<strong>Day 44</strong>Strange things are happening! Something awoke! I saw lights moving in the depths...<br/><br/><br/>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:05:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89c/89c56aca54b87f0271d24c939fd30d2c.jpg", "website": "http://www.bermuda-lost-survival.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 10, "toplay": 1}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 18, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 408, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["NIGHTBOX"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["NIGHTBOX"], "esrb_rating": null}
