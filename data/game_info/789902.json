Seems like someone messed with cosmic forces beyond their comprehension! Worst of all, the door out is locked tight! Don't worry, there is nothing here an expert can't handle.<h3>SPLADD Electronics Site-12 is offline</h3><br/><br/><br/>You're going to need to get the lights back on so you can escape. Unfortunately for you, the backup generator on the bottom floor is blocked by a slew of obstacles. Good thing we installed these repair terminals everywhere. <strong>WARNING:</strong> Accessing SPLADD REPAIR TERMINALS without permission is a security violation and grounds for discharge. Unauthorized use will alert security.<h3>Teamwork is key!</h3><br/><br/><br/>You're not alone in this! SPLADD IT work is done in a two-man team. The Control Room Operator has access to floor-wide diagnostics and can give access to SPLADD REPAIR TERMINALS. Additionally, emergencies grant them access to security cameras and doors to keep employees safe. WIth such a vital job, you'd think they would need more protection than a flimsy wooden door.<h3>MOTION DETECTED</h3><br/><br/><br/>The motion trackers just beeped. No employees other than you two have trackers online though. It's probably just a malfunction during this repair cycle. I still wouldn't go near any unexpected lights.<br/><br/><strong>END TRANSCRIPT SPLADD Sys v2.1.5</strong><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Initial Investigation Notes:</strong> The black box data is heavily damaged and I'm forced to run it on old hardware. As I delve deeper into the archive, what I'm seeing becomes stranger and stranger.
