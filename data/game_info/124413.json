Barros, Michael Cerny Green, Antonios Liapis and Julian Togelius. It uses data from Wikipedia and DBpedia to automatically generate an adventure. Each adventure is created \u00a0by feeding our generator a single name: the victim's. The system finds people related to the victim using their Wikipedia articles, fleshing out suspects and a plot for the murder. It also uses Wikimedia Commons, Spritely (by Mike Cook) and OpenStreetMap to gather images.<br/>While the generator and the UI elements were made by us, humans, the adventures you'll play are byproduct of the system.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-07-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:23:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8a/c8ab18fb5d557b0ffb73f78c39ef4ef6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 134, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Web"], "developers": ["ChampChampChamp", "Gabriella Barros"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
