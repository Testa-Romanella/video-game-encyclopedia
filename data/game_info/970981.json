Simple and direct User Interface!<br/><br/>STORY<br/>MEND Arcade Battle is a video game take of my story MEND. Read the non-abridged version for free on the online writing website Wattpad! I go by Enntropy on that platform, and the story title is MEND. <br/>In-game, the quips between characters before fights offer a small look into the world of MEND. Try your best to unlock the in-game bonus mode for a glimpse into MEND\u2019s story mode in video game form!<br/><br/>Difficulty and Game Length<br/>All selectable characters are unlocked from the beginning, so no needless grinding for the basics! Veteran fighting game and Turn-based RPG fans alike can look forward to seeing if they have what it takes to predict their opponent\u2019s every move. The A.I. opponents all have their own strengths and weaknesses and will put a player\u2019s skill and adaptability to the test. Every route is about forty minutes long so expect at least four hours of gameplay from the Arcade game mode.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T01:18:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e47/e4755b93cfd5f87a4d967113cb2159ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Enntropy"], "genres": ["RPG", "Strategy", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Enntropy"], "esrb_rating": null}
