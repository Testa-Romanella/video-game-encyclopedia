My first ever visual novel and my first piece of literature, so i expect heavy constructive criticism.<br/></p>\n<p>Made with\u00a0Ren'Py\u00a08.</p>\r\nChapters\r\n<p>Only Chapter 1 is partially done. Final game will have more.</p>\r\nFeatures\r\n<p>Multiple endings and routes are planned - your actions will affect this world.</p>\n<p>Achievements - each chapter will have some and they will be related to choices you made.</p>\n<p>Graphics - I don't have an artist yet, so the game is full of prototype graphics. If you want to hit me up with your offer feel free to do so. Though i also don't have any money, and your offer will be pretty stalled. We'll see how this game goes.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-10T10:12:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4d5/4d5aff998c6d340777acafb01afc3f03.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Kraskaska"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
