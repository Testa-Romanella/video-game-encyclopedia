Can you last 50 seconds ????????? <br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The world best record so far is 65 seconds !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>So so easy to play. Swipe your finger left and right on the screen to drag your halo. Don't touch the falling squares for as long as possible. <br/><br/>Similar to racer and retro arcade games, Accelerate X is an addictive little gem that anyone can play. Adrenaline starts to pump as your hit 30 seconds and you'll find your heart beating as you achieve 40 seconds. Keep going as long as you can, this is what Accelerate X is all about - speed, precision and tweaking those finger reflexes :) <br/><br/>Download it for FREE and play our top game today! <br/><br/>The word is Accelerate X is becoming one of the best games in the market and is getting more and more downloads each day. Game players have gone crazy sitting on their butt, on the subway, on the school bus all day trying to top their best score, so be careful, it's addictive ;D <br/><br/>65 seconds is the worlds best record so far. If you beat this score, please send us a screenshot or video capture and we will post it here for the world to see. <br/><br/>The style is inspired by early retro video games such as defender, space invaders, and consoles such as the atari 2600 and vetrex (vector line graphics console). The Accelerate X style is also influenced by neo retro games such as geometry wars, and the movies tron and rez. Older game player with love the old computer art feel and hardcore players will love the challenge. <br/><br/>Accelerate X is part of the X series of pro games by Cobalt Play. These little jewels are training style games which improve your skill in other games. If you're great at one of these you'll scare your friends and school them with your amazing mobile game skills :) <br/><br/>Other titles in the X series include: <br/><br/>Aim X - a sword slice game similar to fruit ninja <br/>Alpha Jetpack X - a jetpack, jump, run the distance title <br/>Tap Tap X - a tap catch - avoid game <br/>Ascend X - a climb high ninjump style game <br/><br/>Also search for our hits Chicks Revenge and Go Chick Go on Android. This isn't a sexy girl chick ;) it's a cute angry chick out to kill the other farm animals and birds. These are funny, casual games, unlike the X series. Blast your way to the sky, shoot sweetcorn bullets, fire off the rocket suit, wage war and dash through the levels. Great fun for kids and adults. <br/><br/>Cobalt Play is a small business with a big plan. Please help make Accelerate X a top rated game by rating it.

These could include - online competition, items such as auto pilot, weapon items (laser, rocket launcher, machine gun), unlockables (you can use google wallet or your mobile network carrier billing), screen capture / video capture to show friends on facebook, copilot / helper orb in the game, multiplayer game, HD version, puzzle mode, defence mode, translate in to new languages, and more. Keep downloading your updates and sending your ideas!! <br/><br/>Note: playing games drains your mobile / tablet battery quickly, so make sure to recharge. We've also had some bug reports in the X series of the launcher not working (game doesn't start), and crashes on phones which run gps and wifi optimisation apps. We think this is a root rom problem, we are working on it and will have an update soon. Just run the game again if you have any crashes. <br/><br/>Accelerate X will also soon be available on facebook, getjar, amazon, android, and appbrain soon.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-02-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-22T13:52:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d92/d9217405f454fb12f89c1bc8c8ff161d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 21, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Martin Finch"], "genres": ["Action", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["Martin Finch"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
