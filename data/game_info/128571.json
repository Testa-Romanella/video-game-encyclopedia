It's meant to be a reflection on the challenging process of game development, complete with its joys and disappointments. It is my hope that <em>All I Wanted Was To Make A Game </em>will provide a context for players and creators alike to walk away with a greater consideration for the highly iterative, focused art of crafting even the simplest of games.</p>\n<p><em>All I Wanted Was To Make A Game</em> was conceived as an experimental documentary game for USC Games' CTIN 479: Documentary and Activist Games in February 2016. I acted in the capacity of solo designer and programmer. The game was developed in Unity Engine and programmed in C#.<br/></p>\n<p>You can read my post-development reflections on the project here: http://www.remotedevice.net/vla/all-i-wanted-was-to-make-a-game/</p>\n<p><strong>Licensing</strong><br/></p>\n<p>All I Wanted Was To Make A Game</p>\n\n<p>This project uses sound effects from Tom Vian at http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/ under the Creative Commons Zero License.</p>\n<p>This project uses background music \"Chiptune Loop\" from kasa90 at http://www.freesound.org/people/kasa90/sounds/167419/ under the Creative Commons Zero License.</p>\n<p>All other creative assets are the intellectual property of Abhishek Biswas.</p>\n<p>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p>\n<p>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/db2/db267cc3faddc105f94edf3ff7e230f9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Arya Biswas"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
