Should she take a leap?\r\n<p>--<br/>Leaps of Faith is a tiny experimental 1-bit platformer game where you play as Faith, a girl surrounded by darkness.</p>\n<p>You control Faith using the arrow keys or the A and D keys to move around, and the Space Bar / Up arrow key or W to jump.\u00a0\u00a0The next platform will only appear after\u00a0Faith jumps -- so you have to take leaps of faith (pun very much intended) in order to advance!\u00a0Faith\u00a0can also jump a second time mid air, but you still have to act fast if you want to reach the safety of the next spawning block.</p>\n<p>Leaps of Faith was designed and developed by\u00a0Andr\u00e9 PiJaMar as a learning exercise and first venture in game development. It was built using the Godot Engine version 3.2.3.<br/></p>\n<p>The font used in the game is called BitPotion,\u00a0designed by\u00a0Joeb Rogers.<br/><br/>Special thanks to all friends and family members for the early playtest and valuable\u00a0feedback, in particular, visual artist @GutierrezNath.</p>\r\nA note from the developer, Andr\u00e9 PiJaMar\r\nThis is my first \"properly\" finished game and\u00a0<em>I understand it's far from perfect,</em> so any feedback is greatly appreciated.<br/>If you have the time, please leave a comment down below, as I'm eager to start new projects and keep learning and evolving as a designer and developer.<br/>Thank you for playing Leaps of Faith!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:04:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8c9/8c90ed2424c4e63ba1b1f15d64e6bbfd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["PiJaMar"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
