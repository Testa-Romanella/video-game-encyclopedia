But as time passed their hubris grew, and the <em>sheevra</em> were created to curb their pride.\r\n</p>\n<p>When it comes to these chaotic and malevolent beings, the lands are full of cautionary tales. Though some would tell you that the stories are just that. To them, names have no power. There are no mysterious deals to fear, and the figure who seduces you into an alley at midnight is certainly no malicious spirit.\r\n</p>\n<p>Which luckily for <strong>you</strong> means easy prey.\r\n</p>\n<p>Since you\u2019ve gained consciousness, you\u2019ve known the mortalis are responsible for draining the world of its magic and creating the Arids, the desolate deserts that have overtaken the land. And the deals you lure them into are the only way the sheevra can slowly restore the world\u2019s more verdant state.\r\n</p>\n<p>But it isn\u2019t always so simple. Most mortalis are still paranoid about the existence of your kind, and as such, the world has become a place where most go by their profession, or else choose a fake name to live their life under.\r\n</p>\n<p>After all, knowing someone\u2019s <em>true</em> name is the most intimate secret a person can offer.\r\n</p>\n<p>You never imagined fearful weaklings like these would be any threat to you. But when an entire sheevra clan disappears seemingly overnight, you\u2019re sent to a city far from your home to investigate.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Will you find out what happened before it comes for you?</strong>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Customizable MC (non-binary inclusive) with different appearances in your sheevra form and glamoured mortalis form\r\n</li><li>Play as a dryad, unseelie, or leanhaun with different features, appearances, and magic bonuses\r\n</li><li>Personality stats that include how you view the mortalis\r\n</li><li><em><strong>Magic vs Might</strong></em> preference, with bonuses depending on your sheevra type to one of the following magic schools:\u00a0<ul><li>Elemental, Illusion, or Pathos\r\n</li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Sentiments:</strong></em> Vials of memories you\u2019ve collected with different effects depending on who ingests them.
