Level them up and grow your defenses, finding synergies both between towers and status effects.<h3>WIDE VARIETY OF TOWERS</h3><br/>Lots of towers means lots of synergies! Find the best build and overcome the waves of enemies with ease!<h3>DIFFERENT ENEMY TYPES</h3><br/>Flying and ground enemies can provide a fun additional layer of difficulty. Perhaps you could use the weight tower to ground all flying enemies for a brief period of time, or the LMG, incredibly strong against flying enemies but not good at much else...<h3>REPLAYABILITY</h3><br/>The base game isn't easy, and it'll certainly take you more than one try to beat it. Once beaten, you'll unlock up to 5 levels of difficulty, each with new random modifiers, harder enemies, and even secret towers! A low difficulty playstyle may be far less viable on a higher difficulty; thus, encouraging experimentation with new strategies to take advantage of the otherwise detrimental modifiers!<h3>AWESOME SOUNDTRACK</h3><br/>Created by @creeper4207 on twitter, this pixel style soundtrack perfectly gels with the simple pixel art to create a chill and relaxing atmosphere.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-06-19T02:38:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/385/38530f062206f109a7fc16d2ffea4a09.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["progress"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["progress"], "esrb_rating": null}
