Similar to other games like Tomb Runner or Doodle Jump the goal is to rise to greater heights each time you start.</p>\r\nMusic\r\n<p>Rise is meant to be a chill and casual experience. In service to that the game has a music track system that allows you to play, pause and skip songs. While playing song names will appear at the bottom of the screen when a new track plays. The songs contained in the track list are ambiance, piano, string, rain, etc...</p>\r\nDeath\r\n<p>Each time you are killed or restart manually the level will regenerate itself into a new configuration. There are a limited variety of \"tiles\" that will generate but they will never be in the same order.</p>\r\nObstacles\r\n<p> Obstacles come in the form of stationary, moving and projectiles. If you touch any of the obstacle types you will instantly die and be given a death screen with stats of your run. All obstacles come in the form of a glowing red object so they are easily identifiable.<br/></p>\r\nWalls\r\n<p> Walls that you are able to interact with can be standard (white), bouncy (green), friction-less (blue) or sticky (black). Each wall type is color coded so that during your run you can quickly identify them.</p>\r\nUnlocks \r\n<p>Unlocks are the main path of progression in the game. Whenever you are at the starting area (you have less than 10 score) an unlock button is visible. This gives you access to additional content that can be acquired once certain heights are met. These unlocks can range from different player shapes (square, hexagon) to new music tracks that you can listen to while you play.<br/></p>\r\nGame Assets\r\n<p>All sounds heard in this game were found in the Unity Asset Store.
