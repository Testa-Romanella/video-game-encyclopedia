I tried to make it as fun as posibble. I will try to release it on mobile platforms to download and play for free\u00a0(with continue\u00a0ads and maybe in-game cosmetic purchases). It is made in <strong>Godot</strong> (free open-source game engine). I used <strong>PICO-8</strong> <strong>secret palette</strong> (with some additions). Art is belong to me. Font I used is called <strong>Press-start 2D</strong>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\u00a0(again):\r\n<ul><li><strong>Programming:</strong> Me</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Art/Assets: </strong>Me</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Font:\u00a0Press-start</strong> 2D</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The game has no sounds/musics at the moment.
