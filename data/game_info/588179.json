I Built this game, as a project for a game development course I am doing. All the Sprites, have been hand drawn by me, even all the animated frames. The Game was built on Unity, using the new 2D renderer pipeline. Originally, it was going to be a story driven adventure platformer but, I didn't have a lot of time, I had less than a month to make this. As a Huge Fan of Anime, I decided to make the game in that art style or close to it. the Level Select button is not working at the moment but, it will be fixed in a future update.</p>\n<p>If I had more time, then I would've met the goals required to make this first game Great. In the future, I will add more updates as I got and then hopefully release it on Steam one day. I have provided builds for all Operating Systems, excluding, WebGL, iOS and Android. Unity's web app player is no longer supported by modern browsers, therefore, I couldn't provide a build for it. Even though it is a small game, I hope you enjoy it. I will be adding more updates eventually, As this is just for a games development course I am working on. The Mechanics at the moment are barebones, I plan on adding more in the future. Hope you enjoy. I plan on adding more slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the first Release version of the game, updates will follow in due time.</p>\n<p>Thanks for Listening<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-19T05:15:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ad/6ad547b8d3f2b1b97e804096c13d5fcf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 297, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Vgtgamer15"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
