The same goes for the background music. Every sprite in the game uses a palette with only 4 colors in it! REAL was created using the Unity game engine and Aseprite.</p>\n<p>So you may ask. What's this game's connection with the official game jam theme? Well, let me explain it to you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In REAL you take control of the character named John.\u00a0 John was living a normal life like everyone else around him. But one day suddenly something strange has happened. John passed out and woke up in a foreign and probably dangerous world where not everything was REAL at the first glance. He quickly discovered that he was one of the few who could see things that others did not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>John does not know where he is and what is that place, but he knows one thing. With the help of his new power that allows John to see things that are not REAL for other people (Reversed Dimension), he has to get out from that world. And that's where you come into all of this. You are the player, and you need to help John escape that dangerous world.</p>\n<p>But beware, because you don't really know what is REAL...</p>\n<p>Hello. I would like to thank everyone that has played REAL. Creating this game for the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1 was a great experience, but it was also kind of stressful. In a few words, I had a lot of different and cool ideas, but only a few days to create this game. Not to mention this was my first game jam in which I've participated. I definitely learned a lot after these few days of development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I must tell you that I really like the whole concept of this game that I had on my mind on the first day of the game jam so if I notice a high interest in this prototype I will definitely keep developing REAL, so it will become a good game one day.</p>\n<p><em>~ Quantum Dev (Quantum Bit Games)</em></p>\n<p>Soundtrack - 8bit Dungeon Boss (Kevin MacLeod)</p>\n<p>Pixel Art Palette - Lava Level (by\u00a0polyphrog)</p>\n<p>Pixel Font (in game)\u00a0-\u00a0FFF Forward Font</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-28T12:41:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/139/139c5843c124973e986998c0e6906684.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Quantum Bit Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
