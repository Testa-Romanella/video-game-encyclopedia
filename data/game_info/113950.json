Run through a randomly generated cityscape, avoiding spikes and pits and collecting coins. Every once in a while, the game speeds up slightly, letting you jump over longer pits and spiketraps but giving you less time to react to obstacles. Saves your highscore - challenge yourself to be the very best!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-03-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b80/b808183d499b966d8415db6083c020f5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Yal"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
