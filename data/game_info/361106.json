The theme was 'Only One', and this grew out of the idea of having only one sprite to represent different things, meaning that you could only distinguish between them by their behavior. You are an alchemist with a variety of alchemical ingredients. You know which ingredients you have, but not which is which and must deduce their identities from their interactions with one another.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-05T21:06:27", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/315/3157e5fd044f4a5a14975597c4d03aaf.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["mcargille"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
