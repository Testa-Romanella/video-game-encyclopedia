The decisions they make affect their opportunities, choices and even changes the way the path is set for them. Once they have completed a playthrough, they may replay again to try out a different possible route to earn as much achievements as possible.\u00a0Whether their goal is to earn the most amount of money as possible, or just enjoy the journey and not be distracted by money, it's all up to the player to decide what means most to them.</p>\n<p>Singapore Life was developed using Unity for the Singapore Heritage Game Jam 2020.</p>\n<p>(Disclaimer: Singapore Life contains\u00a0stereotypes and\u00a0perceptions that may reflect real world views.
