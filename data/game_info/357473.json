You have a number of moves or \"skills\" to help you which are basically a double Rock Paper\u00a0Scissors. Moves are not immediate, they require a small charge time, most of the time\u00a0holding the button down.<br/></p>\n<p>Main Skills:</p>\n<p>A - [A]ttack (Scissors)<br/>D - [D]efend (Rock)<br/>S - [F]eint (Paper)</p>\n<p>The winner inflicts 1 damage to the enemy. The white barrier is your balance/barrier (BP)\u00a0and can be recovered quickly by not fighting.\u00a0If you win with [D]efend, you also regain 1 BP, and if you draw with [F]eint both \"win\" and both\u00a0receive damage.</p>\n<p>Using Space lets you [Da]sh or [Do]dge (no difference at the moment but) which let's you avoid entirely any main skill. However\u00a0a\u00a0quick tap of A, D or F\u00a0becomes a [Q]uick attack which blocks any attempt to Dash or Dodge.</p>\n\n<p>Main Skill, Hold [ADS]\u00a0&gt;\u00a0Quick Attack,\u00a0tap [ADS]\u00a0&gt; Dash [Space]\u00a0&gt; Main Skill<br/></p>\n<p>[A]ttack &lt; [D]efend &lt; [F]eint &lt; [A]ttack\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-07-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-31T09:33:32", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8ad/8add2e551e363112634bbab2d1767713.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 6, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CalixJumio"], "genres": ["Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
