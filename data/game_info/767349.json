Use your laser and rocket to defeat enemies and pick up their batteries to keep yourself charged.</p>\n<p>Any attack that hits your ship will destroy it. Point your shield at an enemy to block their attack - your shield uses battery power to block damage.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first time we\u2019ve competed in a game jam and the first time either of us have made a game using a game engine. We made a lot of mistakes but also learned many things along the way. We\u2019ll definitely be coming back for more jams in the future.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-08T23:23:55", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/921/921cc37ff47cf01562f66f532e389455.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 50, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Chybby"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
