Something I may return to at somepoint.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/>Couple of disclaimers:\u00a0<br/>If the main menu appears to not work it's due to the mouse stealing focus. Retry with a controller as the main input method.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the second level you may get stuck with the first jump, left trigger is to teleport (No time for tutorials).</p>\n<p>There are also some Fatal errors that have been occurring, it's a good thing I implemented a save system so that your hard earned level completion, upgrades and currency are all safe. Not too sure why this error is occurring.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-12T05:19:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ef8/ef8d76d75f682e73ffe89b9a77731727.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 130, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jestersheepy"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
