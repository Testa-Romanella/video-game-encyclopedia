Made the ship, and got some solid colors on it looking good. The cow didn't look so good as one solid color. I had people call it a sheep, so I had to look up how to paint it after that. Lots more tutorials to watch: textures and materials and importing and exporting. Finally got my cow into my game and then someone said it looks like a dog. Oh well, no time to learn how to be a good artist, it is how it is, my (amazing) dog/cow.<br/></p><p>It was my first time playing with spawning things into the world. I spent a long time spawning a ton of dog/cows into the game, turning gravity off, and giggling uncontrollably. Too bad it didn't make it into the game, not enough time!</p><p>I thought about adding some sort of landscape but I ran out of time. I used a failed cow texture and colored it green for the ground. I also thought about making some sort of animations, but I ran out of time and would have to look up a lot more tutorials.</p><p>Bullets have this sweet transform equation I had to use to make them useable X/SQRT(X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2) , Y/SQRT(X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2), Z/SQRT(X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2) Which took me a while to figure out. This is tons better than when they were what looked like a wiggly string.</p><p>I am way too excited about this thing.
