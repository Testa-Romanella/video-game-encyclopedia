The data is completely anonymous and can <strong>not</strong> be used to track you, it will be used to later create a scoreboard for solutions for each level and for my undergraduate thesis which will be about learning and video games.\r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Press the 'help' button on-screen for a list of instructions and other tips about the different models of computation.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-04-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-04-30T05:50:53", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/612/61201f62250c954cffa905ad5fa5ecfa.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["shailpatels"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
