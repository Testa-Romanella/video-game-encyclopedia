Players have, on the whole, rejected this mechanic. So why is our take different?\u00a0Exclusive content is gated behind difficult runs, (e.g. \"Unlock the Jester's Hat by making it to Day 50 using ONLY the Pea-Shooter\"). When we release content, it will <strong>all</strong> be embedded and unlock-able through difficult gameplay, giving high-skill players the opportunity to earn by retrieving the collectibles, levels, etc. and offering them back to the game's community through our marketplace.<br/></p>\n<p>We hope that this system of player-led content releases leads the charge of a new type of Play-To-Earn game; one not based on artificial scarcity, but on actual skill and dedication to the game's community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game was made as part of the MetaFab 2D Shoot-out Jam, and is a 2.5D isometric shooter.\u00a0 Learn more about MetaFab at https://www.trymetafab.com</p>\n<p><strong>*NOTE*</strong>: This prototype is running on the MUMBAI testnet.
