Frankly, I\u00a0wanted to go out and enjoy the sun rather than sit at my desk.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-07-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-07-13T14:51:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b7/9b7139bb36cbe337767c986d66a39229.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["lukebandy"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
