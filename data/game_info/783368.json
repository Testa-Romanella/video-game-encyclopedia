This Ship Ain\u2019t Kraken brings the fun that comes with couch co-op party games, and combines it with a high stakes thrilling experience. Set sail with your party of four rat crew members, and travel the seven seas in search of a mystical beast: the Kraken. Due to the recent uproar of ships being lost at sea, you and your crew set out to prove that this is just another folk tale blown out of proportion. Loose your sails, load your cannons and prepare to survive the living legend that is the Kraken!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Producers: Patrick Persin and Nate Beeler</p>\n<p>Art and Animation: Kaitlyn Small, Ben WolcottSchickler, Olivia Jones</p>\n<p>Designers: Shane Tetro and Michael Odonnell</p>\n<p>Programmers: Colin Keilbach and Justin Marko</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-05-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-05-09T12:27:59", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5a/f5ac70cff23039b670f67062078318b9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 87, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Industrial_Paradox"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
