In this game you have 20 arrows you have to shoot at chickens with a bow. If you hit a chicken, you get the arrow back. If you miss, you loose the arrow. If you are out of arrows, loose. There are also chickens that have an arrow sticken in their boddy. If you kill these ones you get 2 arrows back. It also gets harder over time. Sorry for my bad english ;) .\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-04-14T12:41:46", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fae89912357e250c9c0999e448cd5c6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["KeanoMoris"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
