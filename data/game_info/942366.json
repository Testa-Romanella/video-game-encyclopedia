{"id": 942366, "slug": "depaulproject", "name": "DepaulProject", "name_original": "DepaulProject", "description": "<p>There was once a stranger, a rugged-looking man with a shotgun on his back, who walked into the depths of a dungeon. He had heard rumors of strange noises and movements coming from deep within, and he had come to investigate.\r\n</p>\n<p>The stranger descended the dark and damp steps of the dungeon, his shotgun at the ready. The air was thick with a musty scent that made his nose wrinkle in disgust. He heard faint whispers and creaking sounds, and his heart began to race.\r\n</p>\n<p>As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he came face to face with his first adversary: a ghoul with milky white eyes and skin that seemed to hang from its bones. The stranger raised his shotgun and pulled the trigger, blasting the ghoul into a pile of goo.\r\n</p>\n<p>He continued deeper into the dungeon, encountering more ghouls along the way. Each time, he dispatched them with ease, his shotgun proving to be a deadly weapon against the undead.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, the stranger came to a massive chamber, lit by a glowing crystal embedded in the ceiling. In the center of the room stood a creature unlike any he had ever seen before. It was a hulking mass of flesh and tentacles, with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth.\r\n</p>\n<p>The creature roared and charged at the stranger, who braced himself and fired his shotgun. The blast knocked the monster back, but it quickly regained its footing and lunged at him again.\r\n</p>\n<p>The stranger fired shot after shot, each one taking a chunk out of the creature's flesh. The monster's tentacles flailed wildly, but the stranger managed to dodge them with ease. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the creature let out a deafening scream and fell to the ground, lifeless.\r\n</p>\n<p>The stranger stood there, breathing heavily, his shotgun smoking. He had defeated the monster and saved the dungeon from whatever evil it had unleashed. As he made his way back to the surface, he knew that his name would be whispered in hushed tones among the people who had heard of his heroic deeds. And though he would never know their true gratitude, he would forever be remembered as the stranger who faced the monsters of the dungeon and emerged victorious.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T15:36:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/31d/31d85bf1e16a6ffa48a21c06ece997bd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Josh_Depaul"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
