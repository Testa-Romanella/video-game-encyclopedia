Safety precautions include familiarizing oneself with the standard  operating procedures, lab safety requirements, workers' rights, chemical  data sheets, and equipment handling instructions, as well as proper use  of personal protective equipment (PPE) and handling chemicals in the  fume hood. The actual process of chlorophyll extraction involves transferring  sample fluid into a beaker, washing the sample with acetone,  transferring this sample into a cuvette, and analyzing the sample  quality via spectrophotometer.\r\n </p>\n<p>In addition, it is possible to lose percentage points by triggering  an incident. Improper behaviour from the user can lead to a fire or chemical spill,  which necessitates resolving the situation and stamping an incident  report afterwards (the lost points are recovered upon completion of  these tasks). The user is also susceptible to breaking large glassware, which incurs  an unrecoverable percentage point loss.\r\n </p>\n<p>The user is able to leave the exercise at any time by either pulling the fire alarm or pressing the <em>Complete</em>  button atop the score clock. In both situations, the user will be redirected to the main menu, where  they can either begin the exercise again or quit the application.\r\n </p>\n<p><em>Chlorophyll Extraction</em> is a room-scale experience, meaning  that the size of the virtual environment resembles the size of the  user's physical play area. We recommend a minimum play area of <strong>6 feet by 6 feet</strong> in  order to ensure that all relevant areas are accessible via walking, as  no artificial locomotion methods were implemented for this experience.\r\n </p>\r\nButton Mapping\r\n<p>If the user hovers their virtual hand over an interactable object,  then the object will highlight in either yellow or cyan. The user can manipulate the physical position of objects highlighted in  yellow (e.g. clipboards, glassware, desk drawers, acetone bottles),  while objects highlighted in cyan can only have their states manipulated  (e.g. computer button, faucet handles, eyewash handle).\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Left / Right Hand Triggers (Grips):</strong> Press and hold to grab objects highlighted in yellow.\r\n </p>\n<p><strong>Left / Right Index Triggers:</strong> Press to alter the  state of objects highlighted in cyan, or invoke functionalities on  certain yellow-highlighting objects (e.g. MSDS binder, fire  extinguisher, pipettes, acetone bottles) that are <em>already in-hand</em>. <br/>\n</p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This project was created by myself and a research colleague, Wil J.
