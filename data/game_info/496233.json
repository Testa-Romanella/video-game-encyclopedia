My first childhood memories were playing NES with my uncle. After thinking about what I want to do, and searching for some free-to-use assets, I decided to combine one of my all time favorite games, Double Dragon 2, with the atmosphere of night/winter levels in SMB1&amp;3. We used to play Double Dragon with my friend, Niko, and probably finished it at least once a day. And those Mario levels with dark background, starry sky and snowy platforms still evoke mystical feeling in me. <br/><br/>All graphics are by https://chasersgaming.itch.io/<br/>Music: Towel Defence Comic by  sawsquarenoise<br/><br/></p>\n<p>Towel Defence Comic<br/>by sawsquarenoise<br/>is licensed under a Attribution License.<br/><br/>Sometime around 1991...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-21T04:22:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa2/aa2d52ec665b6171a513ce6f2e92c5b5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 22, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["CptNelson"], "genres": ["Fighting", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
