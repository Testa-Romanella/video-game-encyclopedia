Nice house, beautiful wife, stripes on his shoulder, all the free pizza he can eat \u2013 Rocco's got it made. But things at the top of the Family are changing, and after the rise, usually comes the fall. <br/>\r\nWill Rocco's past finally catch up with him? Is there still any path left for him that doesn't lead to the Infernal fires of Hell? Or has he been trapped in the Inferno this whole time already? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRocco's Inferno is a top down, narrative role playing game inspired by The Sopranos and the crime films of Martin Scorsese. You play as Rocco Dante, a captain in the Reggiani crime Family. Between gangland territory disputes, an unfolding city-wide power struggle, the reappearance of an old flame and more, a normal day in the life of a mobster turns into a living nightmare. Who will still be living by tomorrow, is up to you. <br/>\r\nMake no mistake though, Rocco can't run from the Inferno forever.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nExperience dialogue based gameplay which maintains an authentic conversational flow. Play again and again to uncover new one liners, backstory and references every time.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-25T04:29:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6f9/6f9b2e58a776e5c2ac39f205be39f0fe.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 167, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mac Chancer"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": ["MacChancerGames"], "esrb_rating": null}
