{"id": 16262, "slug": "commandos-3-destination-berlin", "name": "Commandos 3: Destination Berlin", "name_original": "Commandos 3: Destination Berlin", "description": "<p>The game is a continuation of the three previous games from the Commandos series.<br />\nAs in other games of this series, the action takes place during WW2, and the player commands a detachment of saboteurs operating in the enemy&#39;s rear rear. All missions in the game are divided into three campaigns. Each campaign takes place in one of three locations: Stalingrad, Central Europe, Normandy.<br />\nEach mission traditionally includes several tasks. The nature of the tasks is about the same as in the other games of the series: the destruction of objects, equipment, snipers, spies and commanders of the enemy, the protection of our soldiers and officers.<br />\nThe game has a lot of new weapons and equipment. All this exactly corresponds to the real models of armaments of that time. As a result, the set of weapons and equipment in the game has become significantly more diverse and includes even mortars, motorcycles, jeeps. Another notable innovation: the review system now allows you to rotate the camera in all directions and scale the landscape.</p>", "metacritic": 72, "released": "2003-10-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-19T05:10:43", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c8f/c8fb3e68985bac9456ebb8a66d2dc5a5.jpg", "website": "http://www.commandosgame.com/", "rating": 3.75, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 88, "owned": 1711, "beaten": 113, "toplay": 10, "dropped": 64}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 161, "suggestions_count": 650, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 162, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyro Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Merge Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
