Each turn the player gets a new disc to drop into one of the seven columns. The discs can be either numbered (from 1 to 7) or solid.</p>\n<p>A numbered disc will explode when its number matches the number of consecutive discs (connected to himself) either on its column or its raw. When exploding, a numbered disc will crack every solid disc nearby. Solid discs reveal a numbered disc when cracked twice.</p>\n<p>After 30 drops, a new level is reached, spawning a new row of solid discs from below, pushing the existing discs up. When either the discs overflow the top row or the grid is full of discs, the game is over.</p>\n<p>At each disc explosion, the player gets a number of points that increase as the explosion chain (i.e. the explosions combo) gets higher. When a new level is reached, the player gets a bonus of 7'000 points and if the grid gets clearead 70'000 points.</p>\n<p>Apart from the\u00a0classic game mode, the game is available in:</p>\n<ul><li>blitz mode: a new level is reached after every 5 drops (and awards 17'000 points for each new level) but let the player is given only numbered discs to drop;</li><li>sequence mode: always spawns the same sequence of discs.</li></ul>\r\nControls\r\n<p>The game is controlled through keyboard.</p>\n<p>To control the disc, use\u00a0A/D\u00a0(left/right\u00a0arrow keys) to move it sideways and\u00a0S\u00a0(down\u00a0arrow key) to drop it.</p>\n<p>To move through menus, use\u00a0W/S\u00a0(up/down\u00a0arrow keys) to move through the options and\u00a0spacebar/enter\u00a0to select.</p>\n<p>Hitting the\u00a0ESC\u00a0key will prompt the pause menu, where music and sound effects can be toggled and, if in the middle of a game, the current game can be restarted or quit.</p>\r\nTechnologies<p>Drop7 Clone has been developed using HTML5 and Javascript.</p>Credits\r\n<p>All the rights over the original Drop7 games belongs to Zynga Inc.</p>\n<p>The music is the track\u00a0Retroland Recital\u00a0by\u00a0TeknoAXE.</p>\n<p>The ding sound is a modification of the\u00a0Ding Ding Small Bell\u00a0audio by\u00a0JohnsonBrandEditing.</p>\n<p>Everything else, including images and HTML5/CSS/Javascript code, is made entirely by myself.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-09T04:29:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b51/b51f8eb0fcf4deba70d659c90c254e67.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 13, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["oddlord"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
