Or you're out of gas.\u00a0Use A and D to guide your drill and try to hit gold veins. You might go for those *very* dark blocks- they contain gas for your drill, but be wary! They'll gum up the inside workings of the drill, and will slow you down to a crawl. Look out for air pockets- they will speed you up, but you can't control your drill!</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>I went over on my time. I used all 3 hours of the Trijam + 2 hours and 35 minutes, brining the total time spent on this game 5 hours and 35 minutes.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Had a lot of plans for this game, but 3 hours was very tight for me.
