The Cube consists of many rooms; in the center of each room there is a puzzle device; once you solve the puzzle you can unlock the doors to the adjacent rooms. But be careful! The space and time inside the Cube are intermixed; an open door can lead you to prehistoric Earth, to a dimension of unimaginable horror, or into the vacuum of open space!</p>\n<p>Supported languages:</p>\n<ul><li>ENGLISH</li><li>DEUTSCH</li><li>FRAN\u00c7AIS</li><li>\u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419</li></ul>\n<p>Folks, if you want to help us with translating Dark Stories into your native language, contact me at: coder1cv8@gmail.com.
