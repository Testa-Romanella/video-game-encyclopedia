The ghost wanders around the village, breaks into locked houses, and kills the men who live inside. Does that sound like a creepy fairy tale? <br/><br/>It's a folk belief that runs throughout Southeast Asia. Every year in Thailand, dozens of men die in their beds at night under unusual circumstances: they fall asleep, never to wake up again. Many Thai people think these strange deaths are caused by Phi Maemai, the \"widow ghost,\" who can ravage entire villages. <br/><br/>The \"No men in this house\" visual novel is based on the Phi Maemai legend. It tells the story of several eccentric tourists trapped on an island in Thailand because of a pandemic. When one of the villagers mysteriously dies, the characters begin an investigation and conclude that the death may have been caused by... a ghost?<br/><br/>Has the legend come to life, or are the creatures of flesh and blood at fault? Could it have been a tragic accident? \"No men in this house\" is an absurdist detective thriller full of bizarre situations, erratic characters, biting humor, and twists you won't see coming!<br/><br/><ul><li>55,000 words<br/></li><li>Non-generic, awesome OST (seriously!)<br/></li><li>8 characters and a grumpy cat named Cilantro<br/></li><li>Story based on real events<br/></li><li>30 Full HD backgrounds based on actual locations</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-11-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-11-07T03:35:09", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f27/f27cdd346a942a971045eb2ae53358fb.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 221, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Anastasia Erokhina"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Pavel Pichugin"], "esrb_rating": null}
