Let them win, but make it as close as possible so that it feels like a good challenge.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boss can make two actions a turn.\u00a0You can attack a single target or cast a spell for area damage. Each attack is a 1d6 damage. Archer and Knight do 1d6 damage each turn, while the wizard will do 2d6 damage every other turn.</p>\n<p>If you think the players need some help, you can monologue, to waste an action giving the players extra time, or fudge the dice and lie to get a specific roll. Try not to monologue or cheat too much because the players don't like it (and it will hurt your final score).\u00a0</p><p>Created by CannedJava (coding)\u00a0and Magicswordz (game design and art)</p><p>Special Thanks to Vlaskiyov for his voice, narrating the monologues and sound effects and friends who helped test.</p><p>Made in\u00a0&lt;48h for\u00a0GMTK 2022</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-07-19T01:00:16", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5fa/5fa3799f47283052dced02b79590a9dd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 124, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["cannedjava", "magicswordz"], "genres": ["RPG"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
