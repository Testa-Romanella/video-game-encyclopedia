Contains a few bugs.<br/></p><p>Successful Z-Riders must navigate their flight-capable zebra between moving spikes, across spiky checkpoints, reach the little red flag, and save the day. (Use your imagination a little, okay?)<br/></p><p>\r\n\tTrapped in a seemingly endless loop of time and space, our protagonist and their trusty zebra are doomed to repeat their dangerous screen-crossing adventure again and again, facing faster-moving spikes, boredom and repetitive strain injury until they succumb to a spiky death or Can Ride No More.</p><p>The game supports XBox360 controllers using the left stick and B button, or you can play using the keyboard (A, D, and W for Player 1, Left, Right and Up for Player 2).<br/></p><p>\r\n[<strong>Designer's Note:</strong> This game prototype was made in January 2014, and maybe should have been part of Flappy Jam. Although it's quite simple, making this game taught me a lot about coding in GameMaker. Zebras entered the process as part of a joke mode for an unreleased 'dressage' game, in which you move a silhouette of a horse around a sand-coloured screen to music and receive points in respect of perceived artistic expression. The notion of 'Zebra Mode' then set a precedent for the off-hand evaluation of videogames by whether or not they have a zebra in them.]</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-06-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8e7/8e7a5b4883489fee3dae171cc6c23d88.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["%name%"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
