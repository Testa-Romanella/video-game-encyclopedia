The player commands a detachment of saboteurs.<br />\nThe game offers twenty missions. In each mission you need to perform several tasks - destroy the bridge, headquarters, military equipment, enemy commander, save someone from captivity. Different weapons are used for different tasks. Sometimes it is necessary to use pre-captured enemy equipment, including tanks and a submarine. Locations are diverse: Norway, Germany, France, Libya, Tunisia and others.<br />\nThe group acts in the deep rear of the enemy. This means that the number of enemies is always much greater than the number of our soldiers and we have to act secretly. To let the enemy find us means to fail the mission and doom the squad to perish.<br />\nThe group includes fighters who can do a lot of things: climb walls, control land and sea transport, shoot sniper weapons, fight with harpoon, use mines and syringes with poison.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1998-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-03-07T10:47:29", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/253/2539258054a5e134aec9a75fc1da7ad7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 4.2, "rating_top": 4, "added_by_status": {"yet": 84, "owned": 1703, "beaten": 184, "toplay": 18, "dropped": 76, "playing": 3}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 230, "suggestions_count": 536, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 230, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pyro Studios"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": ["Merge Games"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
