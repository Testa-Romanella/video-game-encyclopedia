I used only free assets and i draw myself some basic lighting animations. I'm very new into these stuff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For now i build only two levels. Design and building stages are really exhausting an overwhelming for me. But i beleive i can make it up to ten levels in a month. Then if i can make some money i will try to add new mechanics like item and item market. Then you can purchase items with your diamonds. I really need to hear some feedback.
