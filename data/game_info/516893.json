Don't hurry.</p>\n<p>This surrealistic game is about pandemic.\u00a0It's not about the fear of getting infected yourself. It's about family. It's about your fear and pain.... and about my author's original 2d style:\u00a0everything was hand-painted by myself (except letters and stars).</p>\n<p>You should walk around, find items for\u00a0relatives and solve the problem of how to complete all their tasks and grow up the magic tree.</p>\n<p>Speak with family. It could help. But\u00a0don't overdo it.</p>\n<p>In this game you will find:</p>\n<ul><li>Fantasy creatures,</li><li>Windmill,</li><li>Beautiful flowers,</li><li>Jumping in\u00a0the well,</li><li>Secret room,</li><li>Cloudjumping,</li><li>Waterfall,</li><li>Cave,</li><li>Blowning away,</li><li>Giant eyes,</li><li>Fat birds,</li><li>Happy final,</li><li>Small physical bugs maybe,</li><li>3 easter eggs.
