To help achieve the aesthetic from the original, there is a tight limit on the amount of memory the complete game can use: all code and data is located below $1000 (4K) in the c64 memory....<br/><br/><strong>AIM OF THE GAME:</strong><br/><br/>The aim is pretty simple! Remember the moves that your tutor is doing and do exactly the same in the same order.</p>\n<p>A training facility has been added to the game, where you can do your moves in peace before heading out to the competition where the goal is to 1)\u00a0remember all the moves 2) get high up on the high score.. I wish you luck and good fortune remembering all the 100 moves in your head! :D\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>CONTROLS - HOW DO DANCE?</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Hopefully you know how to dance on your own! But, in this game there are 5 different movements (as it was in the original break dance game from 1984 by EPYX). The movements on your joystick is up, down, left, right and fire to do different moves.\u00a0<br/><br/><strong>CREDITS:\u00a0</strong><br/></p>\n<p>Code:\u00a0Docster<br/>Sprites:\u00a0Rotteroy<br/>Music:\u00a0Magnar<br/><br/>\r\n(C) Megastyle and Phoenixware 2021</p>\n<p><strong>TECHNICAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>\n<p>The game will be made available for downloading March 31st 2021, and is in other words\u00a0not available for download before that date.
