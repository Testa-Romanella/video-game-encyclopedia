It's \r\nuntidy and messed up, but in the end that turned out to describe the \r\nworkflow of these things perfectly</p><p>Even though they're old and crap, I still feel like a parent sending \r\ntheir children into the big wide world. What is wrong with me</p><p><strong>Here's the games I've got in here:</strong></p><ol>\n<li> <strong>Testbed/Being game</strong>- 3D platformer/adventure (2006)</li><li> <strong>Bethany Fife and the Biome of Life (But Actually Death)-</strong> (2010)</li><li><strong> Bulb</strong>- 3D Whatever (2010)</li><li><strong> Cupboard of doom</strong>- 2D twitch skill game (2011)</li><li> <strong>Offensive counters</strong>- 3D multiplayer shooter (2010) (definitley the best one in the pack)</li><li> <strong>Outofbody 2</strong>- 2D platformer (2013)</li><li> <strong>Reaction game</strong>- Reaction\u2026 Game (2011)</li><li> <strong>Riot!</strong>- 2D brawler (2012)</li><li> <strong>MONSTER GUTS featuring EARL</strong>- Games jam game, shooter (2012)</li><li> <strong>\"Schmup\"</strong>- Shmup 1. (2011)</li><li> <strong>\"Shmup 1\"</strong>- Shmup 2 (2012)</li><li><strong> \"Stupid Ring Game\"</strong>- Really old driving game (2006)</li><li> <strong>The Party</strong>- Point and Click Adventure test (2013)</li></ol><p>Note that none of these are finished. Not by a long shot. Don't \r\nexpect anything close to one level of one game. I would've liked to put \r\nsome really old things in here, but most of them are sadly gone.</p><p>There's a readme file in every folder that tells you about the game \r\nin question and about me in lurid detail if you need a bit of help. I \r\ndidn't proof read it. It's all crap. It's raw and real. I can't think of\r\n anything else to say. It can speak for itself</p><p>NOTE: This pack really is kind of bad, and if you want a refund I fully understand and intend to comply</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-09-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c38/c380907105dda0346bffc736b07d0560.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 98, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["TheWaether"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
