{"id": 6800, "slug": "ibomber-defense-pacific", "name": "iBomber Defense Pacific", "name_original": "iBomber Defense Pacific", "description": "<p>iBomber Defense Pacific is the sequel to the original iBomber Defense. It is the second part in this tower defense series designed for mobile devices. </p>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>The game is set during the World War II. Unlike the original game, the sequel shifts its attention to the Pacific Theatre. The goal of the player is to defend his or her towers from the enemy units that attack from the air, land, and water, sometimes simultaneously. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game uses all traditional tower defense mechanics with only slight additions. Like in the previous iBomber game, the player controls his or her units in real time, using the top-down view. Most towers serve as AAAs and gun turrets that fire on the incoming aircraft and armored vehicles. There&#39;s also a Bomb tower that generates bombs which the player can drop at the enemies. The player can build new towers and units and repair them as well as to manipulate his or her towers to adjust their defenses to current needs. For example, the game introduces the Dig In option that allows the player to increase the tower&#39;s safety at the expense of its firepower.</p>\n<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Each level features a new map as well as a primary and a secondary objective. The secondary objectives provide variety to the missions, as some of them require offense rather than defense. For example, the player can be tasked to disrupt the enemy supply. Completing objectives earns the player the Victory Points that allow him or her to level up and obtain additional perks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2012-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-12-18T18:01:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f1/4f1e5d7dcf6ae5a601ee6bad396cca06.jpeg", "website": "http://www.cobramobile.com/steam/", "rating": 2.31, "rating_top": 1, "added_by_status": {"yet": 23, "owned": 927, "beaten": 7, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 20}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 25, "ratings_count": 42, "suggestions_count": 348, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 42, "platforms": ["macOS", "PC", "Linux", "iOS"], "developers": ["Cobra Mobile"], "genres": ["Action", "Strategy", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Cobra Mobile"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
