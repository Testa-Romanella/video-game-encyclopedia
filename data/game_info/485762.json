Instead of going to merely 3, we've immediately taken it one step further by skipping to 4-dimensional box pushing.</p>\n<p>There are some 4D mazes to get yourself oriented / disoriented, and you can also switch the way you view dimensions to really mess things up. A few box pushing levels are included, but the real fun is in the level editor. It has a built-in generator which produces random layouts and tries to generate the hardest possible levels in them. You'll be amazed at the complexity of some of the generated 4x4x4x4 puzzles.</p>\n<p>Current status: It works. There are now 16 levels, including tutorial levels. The interface, especially of the level editor, still needs a lot of work.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-28T04:33:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c64/c64dedf272afc5065ee18cc8a6084dfc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 48, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["trudieprod"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
