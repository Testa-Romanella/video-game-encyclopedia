He is Ouvbane. And he is angry. Rightfully so too, all things considered. He was stuck in limbo for a couple thousand years. And all because he\u2019d tried to make the world a more interesting place. After all, how much fun is researching in the desert? Why not make the cyclops in that region man eating monsters, give them matching robes, and start a cult? And who cares about a benevolent, fair Baron in charge of a town? Ouvbane thinks he should infect him with a lycanthropic disease that\u2019ll turn him and his people into the Grim. The Grim are much more funny! Ouvbane sits back, content with his work, then puts a witch as the head of an all-male Warlock University, traps the mountaintop peoples, and releases an alien onto the Darco lands.All This Without Kidnapping A Pretty Girl too!  <br/>But contractually, he has to kidnap some girl. So he does. Only he choses the wrong one. You see, he took Cauflin\u2019s wife. That\u2019s not to say that Cauflin is a great and powerful warrior; he\u2019s never learned a lick of magic or even picked up a blade. Never wandered the lands, survived the wilderness, or killed so much as a fly. No, Cauflin is a writer. Or rather, a wannabe writer who just happens to be in the middle of writing the Great Volkstein Novel. With his wife gone, however, he looks out the window and realizes the most terrible thing ever; he\u2019ll have to get a real job\u2026she was a breadwinner, the one who brought home the bacon and beer. He wouldn\u2019t even know where to buy those things! <br/><br/>Left with no alternative, Cauflin departs his home in search of his wife. Along his quest, he\u2019ll meet monsters, madmen, insane orb monsters, bandits dressed as ghosts walking around in stilts, literal moosemen, bats of all varieties and a plethora of bosses who all seem to be demented in one form or another. And\u2026his ex! <br/>Can he save his comfy lifestyle, his wife, and finally finish that novel? Or will he just fail because he\u2019s pretty sure he will. He does that a lot. And the quest, now that he is looking at it, looks like a lot of walking. Like the whole country lot of walking. He might just stay home. Or become a bum.
