This was my very first game I made and released it 6 years ago. \u00a0I am alot better then what i did here, and this is crap XD. I should have released this weeks ago, but I didn't. <br/></p>\n<p>My very first game and a simple one. Help Breezy the Mouse get the highest score possible while collecting rings and dodging the Buzzies. If you get hit by one, it is game over.\r\n</p>\n<p>Controls: Use the Up and Down Arrows on the keypad\r\n</p>\n<p>Red Rings = 1 Point\r\nBlue Rings = 3 Points\r\nGreen Rings = 5 Points\r\n</p>\n<p>If you guys have any suggestions and critiques, just let me know because I would love to hear the suggestions. I'll polish and make some minor tweaks based off input.\r\n</p>\n<p>I would like to thank my friends on Facebook for the support, my family and the people in the Gamemaker community who helped make this first leap possible. If it there for them, I'd still be struggling with a game concept and I would been working on something way too complex to never be finish.\r\n</p>\n<p>Credits:\r\nCharacters, Game Design Concept: (c)  Abdur Olajuwon\r\nMusic: Jaden Eckel</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-05T06:15:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ac2/ac21a61f864ced103f0dace84a5d0749.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["slickygreasegames"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
