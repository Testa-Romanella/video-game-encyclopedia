{"id": 57391, "slug": "ken-griffey-jr-presents-major-league-baseball", "name": "Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball", "name_original": "Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball", "description": "<p>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball is a Super NES baseball game that was released in 1994. The game has a Major League Baseball license but not a Major League Baseball Players Association license, meaning that the game has real stadiums and real teams, but not real players (except Ken Griffey Jr.). The fictitious players have the same statistics as their real-world counterparts, and the game comes with a name-changing feature that allows players to change the athletes&#39; names. Nintendo released a portable version of the game in 1997 for the Game Boy with real players and stats from the 1996 season. The gameplay is similar to its predecessors, though it is sometimes sluggish due to hardware restrictions. The SNES version came with a promotional Griffey collector&#39;s card packed inside and was a major commercial success, with 1.2 million units sold.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1994-03-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-24T16:51:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/829/82934d61837fade7f457e3ed03fa6039.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 3, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 128, "game_series_count": 3, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["SNES", "Game Boy"], "developers": ["Software Creations"], "genres": ["Sports"], "publishers": ["Nintendo"], "esrb_rating": "Everyone 10+"}
