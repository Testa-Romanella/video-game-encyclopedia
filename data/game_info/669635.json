In response to this act, they send the ex-general and now-mercenary to convince him, <strong>Anteeno</strong>, who delivers the message in a typical way. A war is waged and an army of bugs and animal mercenaries is sent to the land to sabotage and steal, and put Augustus' life to misery.\r\n  </p>\n<p><strong>Froots </strong>are like fruits on Earth but better and are the main food and the finest gift that the giant star could give.\r\n  </p>\n<p><em>Source code will be uploaded when I have the chance [Game maker 8]<br/></em></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: a small manual is included<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-09-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-27T03:53:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e74/e74858c33bab73b1d828d2f0570983dc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 29, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Neptune Ringgs"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
