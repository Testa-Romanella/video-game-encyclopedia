The player is stuck in an abandoned space station will have to survive against waves of enemies that will continuously spawn. The player will have to keep two turrets stocked to prevent enemies from killing them. One of the turrets is a flame turret, enemies that die by this turret will drop resources that are on fire, draining the limited amount of oxygen available. The player must use a fire extinguisher to put out the fires, so that they can pick them up and use the resource, to either create ammo boxes to refill the turrets, or use it to increase their oxygen. When the timer runs out the player wins .</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T04:41:14", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9b3/9b3b87047e7472c0b3d1dcb04d2a56d9.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 61, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Marcus Gleeson"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
