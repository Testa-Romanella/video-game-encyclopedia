You must upgrade your weapons and place defenses in order to protect yourself and your house. There are 3 different types of helpful placeable objects; helpers, defenses, and structures. Helpers are other people/monsters that either help fend off the hordes of monsters or help in other ways such as repairing damaged structures. Defenses are placeable obstacles that either hurt monsters, slow monsters, or both. Structures are placeable buildings that provide buffs to surrounding helpers, or debuffs to surrounding monsters.<br/><br/><strong>Story</strong><br/>In Cabin of Souls, the world has been taken over by monsters. All people are dead and have been dead for a long time. Cities are destroyed and monsters are running wild. Due to the lack of new souls coming into hell, the Devil decides to resurrect one soul to go back to the living world and defend against the monsters for his entertainment. He gives this resurrected soul a house to protect and to live in, along with a weapon, and is tasked with killing monsters and sending their souls to hell. In return, the Devil will reward them with better defenses.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-07-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-07-10T02:22:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0a9/0a935da54085f6d4e01af4371e4afebd.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 159, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["ConCaerus"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "publishers": ["ConCaerus"], "esrb_rating": null}
