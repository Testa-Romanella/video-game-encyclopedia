But it runs well on Mozilla Firefox and Chrome!<br/><br/>A or D to move left or right,\u00a0</p>\n<p>No jumping allowed yo! So don't you try ;)<br/><br/>Instead try teleporting by clicking somewhere, then pressing spacebar to teleport to that location! Pretty simple... or is it.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>There is a catch. You can only teleport if you have points to spare. To get more collect the floating cubes. Can you beat my high score of 81? psh.. doubt it.\u00a0<br/><br/>Thanks for the support none the less, and enjoy the game! Feel free to donate a buck or two so I can buy more red bulls and diapers for my babies and myself. Red bulls for my babies, diapers for me. Game dev requires no bathroom breaks. :)</p>\n<p>-AJ</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f31/f31c3eab1c50954cd3764850e546776b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 10, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["robotpencil"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
