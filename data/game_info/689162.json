I arranged music, drew new art (basically everything; the only thing I didn't really change were the metal tiles and acid (re-colored and added textures) and the moving platforms), and updated two levels. The music took me the longest, because my ears are bad, so I did look up some sheet music to figure out key signatures and tempos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u00a0arranged two pieces: the Doctor Who Main Theme and Geronimo (but it's actually called\u00a0<em>I Am the Doctor\u00a0</em>in the show's actual OST). The first one shows up in the Main Menu and in Level One, and the second one shows up in level 2.</p>\n<p>I used this website to arrange the music.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I used this website to make the art.</p>\n<p>(plz don't sue me bbc, this is free and i spent two weeks on it)</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-11-05T06:20:56", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c40/c4037cd2f15bea80a47ca2eb9f9e8c3d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Android", "Web"], "developers": ["lynnmwrigh"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
