But this is no ordinary car, this one creates car as he goes and can even freefall throught the sky!</p><p>The main objective with this game was to test if it was easy to create maps with the Tiled Map Editor in conjuction with Tiled2Unity. The final verdict, it's not :/ at least for me, regarding the map editor itself Its actually pretty good, just not very user friendly and in need of a move tool. The main problem in on importing it all to unity, and that's where tiled2unity fails, it imports the maps with weird artifacts, it doesn't implement tags correctly and is overall quirky.</p><p>In the end I think the game turned out nicely, but this was lesson for me to never use Tiled and to create a Map Editor Tool Myself</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-09-07", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/545/54577386184af526f59142a23f472d05.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 1, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Warm Feet Games"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
