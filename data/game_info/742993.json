There is an exponential difficulty increase when playing the game, and there are powerups that allow you to deal with that more effectively. The game keeps track of your highscore once you die, so you can compete with your buddies.\u00a0 Development will be based on the popularity the game gets. I will add bosses and stuff later on if enough people actually care about this game.<br/></p>\n<p>Discord:\u00a0https://discord.gg/mqTumqw6qM</p>\n<p>YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Dubscr</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-02-21T09:47:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3d3/3d30bf026570e0d9d9c7c394a3c5eb02.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 25, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Dubscr"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
