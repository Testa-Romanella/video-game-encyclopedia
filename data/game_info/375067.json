A all original cast and a all original plot. It's made for fans of the game or new comers who just want a new visual novel to sink their teeth into.\u00a0 A group of 10 elite high school students are gathered at a very special, high class high school. To graduate from this high school essentially means you'll succeed in life, but graduating is very difficult. The school is presided over by a Pink and Blue teddy bear called Akiokuma, and he explains to them that their graduation hinges around committing a murder. The only way to graduate is to kill one of your classmates and get away with it. If the other classmates discover the identity of the killer, the killer is the only one executed. However, if they fail to catch the killer, only the killer graduates and the others are annihilated. Which of the 10 will survive the bloodbath to come?</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-14", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-16T05:39:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a4/2a407b7c536135286029b927712a2980.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["thisisarandomfandom"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
