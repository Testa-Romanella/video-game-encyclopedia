Gold everywhere, but monsters too! The chests have bombs, gold, and potions. You\u2019ve even have a hazy idea of a flaming sword in your head. What are these barrels everywhere? Full of gold too? Pretty sturdy things, seems like it may take a bomb to open them up. There\u2019s a ladder? Looks like it leads to a dungeon\u2026 and another ladder. Up into a castle! The monsters seem to get stronger as you go, but the loot grows larger. The monsters get faster as you collect more gold, closing in on you, surrounding you\u2026!</p>\n<p>An action RPG, almost a mini Diablo, where there\u2019s only one thing you\u2019ve got to do, collect gold. There\u2019s controller support, and I highly recommend playing with one.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22a/22a882f67c080579a2ec9d3b0dcf9cea.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 24, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["nardandas"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
