The player commands a battle-mech, wielding a large sword as their primary weapon. Gameplay is centered around chaining together attacks smoothly and accurately in order to build up damage bonuses. You are also given a rocket-powered dash maneuver, a reflective energy shield, and a blinding stun attack that helps you evade and outmaneuver opponents which are much more agile than you. </p><p>Plays best with a controller (although it isn't required).<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5b4/5b49692a8a1ddc5447b2ef8d55c49e59.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 65, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Matt Levonian"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
