I'll be glad if it would turn out to be useful for you as well.<br/></p>\n<p>This app should work from some mobile devices as it does support touch controls. It also works with a keyboard and/or mouse, but more importantly, you can use it with your gamepad!\u00a0\ud83c\udfae</p>\n<p>The levels in the main menu unlock the new letters from the alphabet. It means that exercises may include more letters and words. You start from the first level, get comfortable with the first set of letters, and go to the next level.</p>\n<p>Every time you do a new round, you'll get new challenges (they're randomized). Keep repeating the same difficulty level until you feel comfortable and get \"flawless victory\" reliably.<br/></p>\n<p>There are 6 difficulty levels in total. The last level includes all letters and words.</p>\n<p>There are 3 modes:</p>\n<ul><li>Letters-only: limit challenges to the letters only (alphabet)</li><li>Words-only: limit challenges to the words only (vocab)</li><li>Mix: it's both modes combined, you'll get everything</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-03T09:59:21", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b91/b914f19bb7b02c376dde55175804ef70.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 56, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Iskander"], "genres": ["Educational", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
