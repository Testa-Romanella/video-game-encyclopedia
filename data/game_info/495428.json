It tells the tale of an enkian named Orpheus who receives a vision from his god tasking him with putting an end to the murders in his village of Vandros. As Orpheus you must use your wits to find who is behind the killings and navigate your village and it's surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>The game was designed to help me get to grips with the GB Studio engine and the game is fully compatible with with the original GameBoy. Yes, that's right! It can be played on an emulator or put on a cartridge and played on the original hardware. It was also a good way to set a new short story in my Tale of Enki setting that's featured in my RPG, Tale of Enki: Pilgrimage and my tabletop games.</p>\n<p>____________<br/></p>\n<p>Follow\u00a0<strong>Enkian Games</strong>\u00a0on social media!</p>\n<p>Twitter\u00a0I\u00a0Minds\u00a0I\u00a0Gab\r\n</p>\n<p>If you want to do a video review or Let's Play,\u00a0<strong>go ahead</strong>!
