Or will you leave your car and disqualify yourself from the race?</p>\n<p>This game is intended as a deconstruction of what it means to be a racing game, and also what it means to be a multiplayer game (since no one is moving).<br/></p>\n<p>Originally created for the Meta Game Jam, I never released No Wheels Racing because I thought this game was too awful to release. However, due to popular demand, the game is <strong>now available as an instant download for all</strong> <strong>$10+ supporters on my Patreon</strong>.</p><p><em>Tweet about it here</em>.<br/><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-03-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/844/844d21cf257e7cc1fc4974d352a87f74.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Xavier Ekkel"], "genres": ["Racing"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
