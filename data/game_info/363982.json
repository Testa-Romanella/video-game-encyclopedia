She can make the marble circle her like a planet but only for a short amount of time before she drops it! Can you make it to the end?<br/></p>\n<p>The mouse is the only thing you need to play this game properly with extra quality of life stuff attached to  keyboard buttons like pausing or changing the music.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS:</p>\n<p>Left click pivots the marble around you</p>\n<p>Right click releases the marble from orbit</p>\n<p>Scroll Wheel moves the camera up/down/left/right depending of it's current scrolling type</p>\n<p>Clicking the Scroll Wheel changes the type of scrolling</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><br/>This was made for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2019... but I didn't post it in time due to not understanding time zone differences. However, I am pretty impressed with how it turned out for a two day project so it's here for you to play in browser or/and in exe form by download.</strong><br/></p>\n<p><strong>The exe is more accurate to what I made. Minor differences being different font choice and holding q + u will end the game during gameplay.</strong><strong> If you refresh the page the Start Screen Music doesn't play but everything else is fine. The exe doesn't due that.<br/></strong></p>\n<p><em>Either way, Enjoy!</em><br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-08-05", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:14:38", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/226/226bd03b878077df4bbd379a2efb9253.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["Zunzet Ridah"], "genres": ["Action", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
