All you need to do is survive inside the room within 37 hours (or 10 minutes in real world). There are carnivores out there! Be sure to lock yourself up by patching and fixing doors. Also, there will be no action without a weapon. So, grandpa has one big chainsaw. Either kill, run, or lock yourself in one tiny room. It;s your choice.</p><p>By the way the game is for ludumdare 37. The theme is \"One Room\".</p><p>This is the ludumdare page</p><p>The source code: Github</p><p>--my accounts--</p><p>blogspot - http://doppelgunner.blogspot.com/</p><p>instagram - https://www.instagram.com/doppelgunner/</p><p>twitter - https://twitter.com/doppelgunner</p><p>google+ - https://plus.google.com/u/0/111975005561843752356/...</p><p>facebook - https://www.facebook.com/doppelgunner</p><p>youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjd_DY1LawVuZuLte...</p><p>github - https://github.com/doppelgunner</p><p>.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-12-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T23:22:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/0d6/0d6d90988475c1eb6064a0c968987bb4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["doppelgunner"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
