The experience is to showcase that there is more to this cycle; specifically about how the fungi behaves and gets away with it. It teaches the player the science behind it by having them make choices and cause infection through mini games. The gamification of this horrifying cycle is to educate further than reading a textbook. Instead, it provides an immersive, hands on learning experience that will draw the player in with a humorous narrative and scientific environment.<br/></p><p>My group was chosen through a proposal process to create\u00a0Zombie Ants VR, a VR educational experience for De Bekker Lab (Parasitic Behavioral Manipulation) at UCF.\u00a0We started development in Unity\u00a0mid-October 2020 in Multi Modal class at UCF and we're a team of nine.</p><p>My role as Producer, Designer, and Artist is to create documents, organize team schedules and the task list, create medium poly models and UI, and implement art assets.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-23T04:43:05", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d8f/d8f59512d2d8a514881770202cb030b6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["AudreyL"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Educational"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
