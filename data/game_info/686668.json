Free-Entry Fair currently contains two popular carnival games, but with a spin! <br/></p>\n<p>Balloon Popper: Instead of throwing darts at balloons, you throw balloons at darts!<br/>Goldfish Catcher: Instead of throwing a ping-pong ball into a a bowl of water to earn prizes and a goldfish - throw a fish into the water bowl!<br/>Free-Entry Fair is a SteamVR and Windows Mixed Reality compatible game. It utilizes the grip buttons to grab and release objects and the thumbsticks to move and rotate.<br/><br/>Free-Entry Fair was created for the VR Super Jam (https://itch.io/jam/vr-super-jam) by three individuals. All assets were created in house, during the 72 hour jam, except for the VR locomotion, hand grab system, music, and fonts. The VR locomotion and grab system was only partially created for this jam, as some of it was created for Harold's Harrowing Heroics (https://plus2studios.itch.io/harolds-harrowing-heroics), however modifications and visual updates to this system had to be performed for this jam.<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-29T12:06:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d1e/d1e7fe4e5159553af82d5626ba14be61.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 67, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Ram", "Plus2Studios"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
