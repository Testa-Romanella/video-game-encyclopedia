{"id": 725459, "slug": "against-the-current-alpha-build", "name": "Against The Current - Alpha Build", "name_original": "Against The Current - Alpha Build", "description": "<p>DEMO VERSION - Constains roughly 1/5 of the game.\u00a0 (2-5 hours)<br/><br/>Journey through placeholder graphics and solve puzzles as you save animals, disarm traps, watch birds and try to stay Zen as you tackle increasingle more difficult puzzles. The unique travelling system on the back of a turtle gets you around to see all sorts of Islands, each with unique puzzles and birds.<br/><br/>Note: We are currently transitioning from 3D to 2D and the visuals are currently NOT GOOD. But, we're getting there!</p>\n\n<p>Saving does not work within the Itch.io version, but will be in the final release.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is that supposed to be?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The current version of the game is missing some visuals, this is due to the early state it is in. Here is a list of visuals that are either unclear or missing entirely:\r\n</p>\n<p>- Any Text that appears on-screen will be drawn in the dirt around that area.</p>\n<p>- The 2 UI elements (Birds/Axes) will be in a book that can be opened at anytime, which also serves as the menu.</p>\n<p>- The entire game is Fey Themed, so everything has a mystical twist and isn't as it seems.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Fox: Is supposed to be a Fey-rabbit.\r\n</p>\n<p>- Red circle spiky thing: Fey-Bear Traps, thematically they are buried spiders that steal prey underground.\r\n</p>\n<p>- The black lines on the ground are mushroom lines, they are currently placed procedural and thus are overly \"Square\".\r\n</p>\n<p>- The Black \"thing\": is a Fey_Bull. (I worked hard on that model!)\r\n</p>\n<p>- Black circle with Green dots: A hole trap\r\n</p>\n<p>- Blue Fox: Is suppose to be a Fey-Walrus\r\n</p>\n<p>- Black Fox: Is a Fey-Turtle</p>\n<p>- The Dots on the floor are Bird-Seed\r\n</p>\n<p>- The Large Island with the colorful blocks is the back/shell of a Giant Turtle. When it moves, that is the Giant turtle swimming.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-21T10:59:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/19b/19bdc7b0bbc3d4845962c95b27af7d53.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 7, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Memymoi", "Viziix"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
