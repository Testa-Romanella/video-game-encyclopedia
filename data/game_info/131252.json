Find your way through the catacombs of this horror text adventure as you struggle to survive with your life and your sanity intact.</p>\n\n<p>This is an old text adventure that I've written a while back that I plan to revisit for a graphic adventure treatment later. At the moment I am busy with my other game Roses will Rise and will get to that graphical version later. This is my first ever published game, so it's ridden with bugs and grammatical errors and plan to fix that on said version.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-10-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/24e/24ef014114c8e76ab954b925522a8131.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Asatiir"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
