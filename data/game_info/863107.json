There's something evil about it, but he just couldn't remember why. Maybe something to do with why there seems to be houses for ten times the residents who live there. Maybe if we send an adventurer to investigate. weird how suddenly there are never any around anymore.</p>\n<p>FlyingKaida's first roguelike dungeon. Kill 20 orcs to win. Just don't blink, everything seems to feel... different when you do. Almost like you can't quite remember what's happening down there. </p>\n<p>I had SO much fun working on this game. I have so many features I'm hoping to implement after the jam. Such as an entire False Hydra narrative and boss fight. But for now enjoy fighting the orcs. ^-^</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T18:56:34", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/814/81419d6dcdf15082f688cfb047050482.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 14, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["FlyingKaida"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
