As you navigate the treacherous course, you'll need to avoid obstacles and stay on the track as you push your car to its limits. But the track is so dangerous that it's almost inevitable that you'll skid off at some point. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat's where the real fun begins! When you crash, your car will automatically deploy its wings, helping you to glide back onto the track and get back into the race. But don't let that fool you into thinking that you can just careen off the track without consequence. You'll still lose precious time and risk falling too far behind to catch up with your opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWith stunning graphics and heart-pounding action, Win or Crash! is a racing game like no other. Can you navigate the treacherous track and come out on top?
