The rules of normal pong still apply - however, the arena removes the floor and ceiling, stretching up and down into distant goals. The game is simple: get the ball to the other side, whether that means left/right or up/down. Add in a dash, a charge-shot, and curveballs, and\u2026 well, I think you get the picture ;3</p>\r\nControls:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Escape to pause\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 1\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>A and D to move left and right\u00a0</li><li>Hold both at once to charge a stronger hit (alternatively, check settings to switch this to use S)\u00a0</li><li>Left shift to dash\r\n</li></ul>\n<p>Player 2\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>J and L to move left and right\u00a0</li><li>Hold both at once to charge a stronger hit (alternatively, check settings to switch this to use K)\u00a0</li><li>Right shift to dash\r\n</li></ul>\nCredits\r\n<p>Hazel Kennedy - Team Lead, Programming, Art, UI/UX</p>\n<p>Calli Kiler - Programming, Design</p>\n<p>Sam Hansen - Programming, SFX, VFX, UI/UX</p>\n<p>Rose Zhang - Programming, UI/UX</p><p>Music from\u00a0ZapSplat</p><p>Made for Ludum Dare 51<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-07T21:04:54", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d90/d9000db94b8c0d11f0a7aed4552faa87.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Dawdle"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
