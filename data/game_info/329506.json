There is a bunch of things here that a GameBoy can't do. We were inspired by the theme, and wanted to make a fun and arcade game, keeping an old-school style and the color variations of a GameBoy.</p>\r\nDescription\r\n<p><strong>Catch a friend and play\u00a0</strong>this coop\u00a0survival shooter\u00a0game (or singleplayer game if you are really good at multi-tasking !\u00a0Or alone), with crabs. And bombs. And water lasers. What are you waiting for?</p>\n<p>In\u00a0<em>Crabs in Troubles\u00a0</em>you will need to cooperate to survive as long as possible.\r\nTo achieve this goal, you have some tools :\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- Two\u00a0BEAUTIFUL\u00a0<strong>majestic crabs<br/>\n</strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - The ability to fire and/or charge\u00a0<strong>WATER LASERS</strong>\u00a0to destroy obstacles. But only at 90\u00b0 (you are crabs !!).<br/>So, take care of obstacles while covering your friend, while he is doing the same for you. It's a question of global vision. And even if it's slow, take care, it can be vicious.<br/><strong>WARNING : YOU NEED TO BE ON THE EXACT SAME LINE OF AN OBSTACLE TO DESTROY IT WITH YOUR LASER<br/>Left player : C to shoot<br/></strong><strong>Right Player : P to shoot</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -\u00a0Some\u00a0Three\u00a0<strong>INCREDIBLE SUPERPOWERS</strong>.
