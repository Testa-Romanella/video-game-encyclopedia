I just wanted to see if I could do it, and I am really happy with the result. Thought I might also step out of my comfort zone and try to make something wacky for a change. It's not a deep game, but I hope it's fun. I actually tried to ignore my years in art school to come up with zany designs and level themes that I feel a 9nth grader would think is cool (or at least, travel down memory lane to the kinds of designs I thought were cool when I was a 9nth grader). For maximum enjoyment, please take it at face value, thanks!</p>\n<p>Sayuri~</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Big thank you to Naoya Sakamata for the Japanese Localization and OST!</p>\n<p>https://open.spotify.com/album/48x0I3igHqVyn9g7WF9xsX</p>\n<p>https://music.apple.com/album/feathery-ears-%E7%BE%BD%E8%80%B3-original-sound-tr...<br/>https://music.apple.com/album/feathery-ears-%E7%BE%BD%E8%80%B3-original-sound-tr...<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-12-18", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-12-20T03:19:36", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a2a/a2afbd9b778da565a61e7d3a561bc7d4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 293, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Sayuri Artsy"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
