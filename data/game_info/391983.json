In reality the people who I should have cared about, weren't the kids in school, but the\u00a0people by my side the whole time. This is a story of how long it took me to realize one of the most important things to me today, familial love.\u00a0</p><p>This game is intended for anyone who is willing to listen.</p><p>If you take anything from this, I hope that it is a better understanding of how moldable a person is. Even though kids may be little monsters at times, they understand the love and care that they're shown and sometimes it will stick with them for the rest of their lives.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-11-18T03:41:30", "background_image": null, "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 0, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nerdlez"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
