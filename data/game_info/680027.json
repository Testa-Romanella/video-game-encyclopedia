Cubes of Death is played from a 3D grid view and has both a story mode and an arcade mode (with randomized settings). 6 skill levels include everything a beginner needs to get into the game, a more challanging mode for the quick-thinker and GOD-MODE, for those of you that really think you will be reincarnated as a box your life after this. The 6th mode is where you get to measure your skills with your friends, allowing you to customize a course entirely for your needs, using a seed to replay same map as your friend and compare your scores and times. In future settings we are implementing PvP as 1 on 1 and up to 4 players in a battle royale style where players compete for time capsules, one-time-use-weapons and re-usable traps. The story-mode will hopefully get a co-op mode in the middle of 2022 and after that, we will see what you, our player-base asks for. Our ears are here for you so please send us ideas for future releases, we want Cubes of Death to be fun, fastpaced and re-playable.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T02:08:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ba5/ba51cda292f4532c78c90ed22a1645ee.jpg", "website": "https://www.facebook.com/Cubes-of-Death-100134915774417", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 139, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Madhatgames"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Madhatgames"], "esrb_rating": null}
