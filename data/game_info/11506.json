Designing with the source-code of matter is not just for scientists. Imagine if instead of bricks from Minecraft, anyone could select elements from the periodic table to create complex molecular structures.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOur goal is to provide the tools necessary to help people build new proteins, molecules and eventually also simulate their interactions. We are working on linking nano-one with complementary molecular modeling and simulation software that would allow for the geometries you created to be saved and exported to other programs that could import them as coordinates. (This is to be released in a later version).<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe system is being designed in partnership with the University of California, San Diego.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor beta access, let us know a little bit about yourself here: http://bit.ly/nano-one", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-11-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af9/af9347391d3bcc46e054464ab0d6e982.jpg", "website": "http://www.nanome.ai", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 106}, "playtime": 26, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 39, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Nanome"], "genres": ["Educational"], "publishers": ["Nanome"], "esrb_rating": null}
