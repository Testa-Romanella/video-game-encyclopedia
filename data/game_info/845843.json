He adapts his fighting style to you. If you are ferocious, he will attack you head on. If you fight slower, he'll be more laid back. In terms of defending, he'll attempt to predict your attacks a couple seconds before you swing.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>Left Click - Attack</p>\n<p>Right Click - Defend</p>\n<p>r - Reset</p>\r\nDeveloper Notes\r\n<p>Thank you for trying out my game. Hopefully, this will be the first of many. I'm thinking about specializing in boss fight type games. In the short term, I plan to make bosses that you can fight with AI teammates. In the long term, I hope to make it multiplayer. How cool would it be to have 10 or 30 people fighting the same boss.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Developer - Allan (PastaPlease)</p>\n<p>Artist -\u00a0brullov, check out\u00a0brullov.itch.io</p>\n<p>Artist - adwitr, check out adwitr.itch.io</p>\n<p>Sound - zapsplat.com<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-08-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-02T17:32:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9b/f9b72f4dc44c2285d27d89d955eca51b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 83, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["PastaPlease"], "genres": ["Action", "Fighting"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
