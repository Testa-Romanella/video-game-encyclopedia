The rifle has infinite ammo but a very strong recoil, so each shot makes it fly out of your hands for anyone to grab.</p>\n<p>Being the last man standing is important, but getting a high score is also important. If you see an opponent targeting another opponent, push him out of the way so you can later get the kill for yourself.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\nKeyboard+MouseGamepadRunWASDLeft Stick<br/>DPAd<br/>ShootLeft Click<br/>Right Trigger 1<br/>Right Trigger 2<br/>JumpSpacebarSouth Face Button<br/>PauseEscapeStart\r\nQ&amp;A\r\n<ul><li><em>Why is the standing animation so weird?<br/></em>I wanted the right arm's position to be fixed so that I don't have to coordinate the rifle's position with the animation.</li><li><em>Why is there no gamepad support in the HTML version?<br/></em>Because gamepad support in WASM sucks, and at least on Firefox when the right thumbstick was at rest it was interpreted as not-at-rest which was very annoying - so I disabled it entirely.</li><li><em>This is not how Round Robin works!</em><br/>Tell that to the guy holding the rifle.</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-13", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-17T19:40:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/5ac/5ac406a5c643a97562a185a35803b82d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "Linux", "macOS", "PC"], "developers": ["Aeon Felis"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
