It was a raw game programmed in Z80 assembly language that took me about a year and a half to make in my spare time (I was a math student then). More than 12 years later, in March 2020, I decided to have a little fun and port it to PC. This is not just a simple port though, the game has been enhanced in many ways! It now includes:</p>\n<ul><li>a support for gamepad &amp; keyboard</li><li>a new kickass soundtrack inspired by the NES era</li><li>a few tweaks on gameplay mechanics (enemies do not respawn anymore, breakable tiles are visually different, some levels have been patched)</li><li>a complete rewriting of all texts for better clarity</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-26", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-30T06:53:17", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a1e/a1ef65e5e5aad7f46ff4d4e97d36e0ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 66, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MartinBousquet"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
