I have decided to collect them here, and for a price you can download them. I hope you enjoy exploring this collection of perambulations.\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\nBy purchasing this you will receive access to all future additions to the collection. I intend to increase the price as more walking sims are added.\r\n</p>\n<p><strong>Included In this collection  is</strong>:<br/><br/>-The God Worm began its life as a test for some procedural generation. It takes place in some sort of pocket dimension.<br/>-Darkling is an experiment inspired by a poem I enjoyed. I very nervously recorded my self reciting the poem.<br/>-Infinite Autumn another proc gen experiment. It was shaped by unforeseen circumstances into something else.<br/>-inis was a test for an art style. It soon became an exploration of an island environment.<br/>-So We Were All Stuck in the T Pose, was a scene where I tested some assets, and unity's ragdoll system.<br/>-Unreality was an attempt to evoke a childhood memory of toying about in the original Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes On These Games</strong>.<br/></p>\n<p><em><strong>All Games Can Be Exited By holding Down Esc For 3 Seconds</strong></em><br/></p>\n<p>1.<br/>The God Worm features a Minecraftlike mechanic. You can break blocks by clicking on them. The aim is to find the pink blocks(The worms heart) and break it.<br/><br/>2.<br/>Infinite Autumn has a deteriorating framerate as more autumn is generated. This was a mistake in my programming, but also plays into my vision of the game. Please persevere.</p>\n<p>3.<br/>There is a door in the center of the maze in Unreality. To open it you must walk into the white cube in the wall.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-08-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/65c/65c715bed7b7723148d4277f669c6c62.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 137, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["Breog\u00e1n Hackett"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
