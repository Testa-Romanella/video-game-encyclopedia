After reaching a severe water shortage and emptying the oceans for fish in the year 2064, the disappearance of the world\u2019s rainforests and the chemical pollution reaching life threatening conditions in the year 2073, all nations of the planet Earth have come together to declare a global state of emergency. Within 9 years after the initial declaration of a global state of emergency, the newly formed UNE (United Nation of Earth) started a space program under the name ISA (International Space Academy), to train and prepare people for upcoming spaceflight seeking new habitable planets. Backed by the Worlds leading Aerospace Company \u2018DELTA/ONE\u2019, the first manned crew was sent into the outer reaches of space with a capable spacecraft on January 12th 2082, taking the lead for the next 4 generations of exploratory spaceflight. Now in the year 2163, one of those manned exploratory spacecrafts named \u2018Astra\u2019, finds itself 4062 light-years away from planet Earth, in the unknown depths of space. On board of the Astra you find 6 capable individuals. The Captain, the Space Pilot, the Scientist, the Engineer, the Doctor and the Botanist. With each of them fulfilling their roles, creating a strong crew. One night, while the crew is sound asleep and the Astra is running on autopilot, they encounter a head-on collision with space debris, shaking and damaging the spacecraft and putting the Astra partially offline, triggering a state of emergency. The Captain of the Astra takes charge and aids his crewmates to get the Astra back online and running.\r\n</p>\n\r\nGameplay\r\n<p>The level is set inside of the Astra, currently in an emergency state. Onboard the Astra are the accessible areas and rooms consisting of the Bridge, the Captain\u2019s Quarters, the Crew\u2019s Quarters, the Main Deck, the Cargo Bay, the Engine/Power Generator Room, the Engineering Bay, the Medical Facility and various Hallways connection everything together. Not all areas are accessible from the get-go. Some doors and areas are closed off by the Computing-System due to the emergency state and need to be opened by overriding/hacking doors through Terminals.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nGoal\r\n<p>The goal of the Game is to get the Astra out of the emergency state back online and running by solving various Puzzles spread around the Astra.\r\n</p>\n\n\r\nCredits\r\n<p>Sound Effects\u00a0and Music by Weloveindies &amp; Epidemic Sound</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-07-31", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-08-01T04:28:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/a6a/a6ae4c4eec2b9f48415e1e2bb84c7b79.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 35, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Phatur"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
