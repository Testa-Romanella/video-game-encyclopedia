How long can you make it before flushing him into the toilet? Choose 1 out of 3 fish and survive the longest by taking quick choices to avoid him getting killed.</p>\n<p>Made for the Mini Jam 91: UFO, more like a Browser Edition since I have to upload it as an exe file or smth.</p>\n<p>Edit: So as I can't afford to get my file converted to an exe (thank you, Construct 2), this is going to be the official version. I'm really sorry for the mods if that's an inconvenience, I wasn't really expecting this many obstacles to happen.</p>\n<p>Edit 2: Turns out I got more time left so I updated some little things. I added more SFX (also made homemade and by the way I specified in my submission form). Also now it's easier to know when your fish is dying and rocks have a special sound now. Also, one of the main bugs was (apparently) fixed. Now the water seems to work properly. The other two remain the same sadly, but luckily at least I know that the water bottle bug is just caused when the first bottle gets empty then you collect one of water, which for some reason causes the other bottles to become useless. I've double checked all events involved and still couldn't find the problem source. I'm really sorry, but at least now the water seems to be working properly.</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>- Left\u00a0/ Right Arrow Keys to choose a window to move.</p>\n<p>- Up to feed your fish</p>\n<p>- Down to change the water your fish is in.</p>\n<p>- N\u00b0 1; 2 and 3 to make a fish choice in selection menu.</p>\n<p>- Enter to replay\u00a0 after losing.</p>\n\n<p>Everything in this game is made by MissingWilliam. All sprites, assets, sfx and music have been made by me. Engine used is Construct 2, sprite \"engine\" is Piskel, and for the main theme I've used Google Music Lab and Filmora to edit the SFX (homemade) and change the tone of the music.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Bugs / Errors:\u00a0(Sorry for not solving them, I actually would but since I'm using Construct 2 free edition and I'm only able to use 100 events,\u00a0 which I have hardly managed to get the game to work. I feel kinda bad about them but at least for now I think there's no much I can do :(\u00a0 )</p>\n<p>- Sometimes in selection screen even if you press a number and the music starts playing, it won't work. Seems to be related to pressing some keys before the numbers, but couldn't get a way to solve it. Slowly pressing or reloading the game should solve it.</p>\n<p>- When changing water, sometimes the bottles 2 to 5 get stuck and you only get able to use water from the first one, usually when this one's water runs out. Getting rid of all the water from the first bottle then playing normally with bottles 2-5 seems to solve it.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-10-18T05:51:10", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/06e/06edffc7255bb2a8e655ee91c0aec1ff.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MissingWilliam"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
