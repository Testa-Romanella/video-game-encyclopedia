To do so, just try to stand in your bullet trajectory.</p><p>If you fail to catch it, or you miss a shot, you will simply restart the level. Your bullet will change colour as its lifespan depletes, from yellow to red. When the bullet is about to die, a warning sound will notify you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>There are 4 levels with this first release. Each level contains a secret (extra score points!), so keep an eye out for those.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-10-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-19T05:57:04", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b7e/b7e3978698c1d9da0e9659b553fff036.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 111, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Mauro"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
