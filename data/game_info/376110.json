Over the course of three days, she will explore the history of the ship, the lives of its inhabitants, and their relationships to one another.<br />\nOnce aboard, she can visit the rooms of the ship\u2019s odd and delightful residents, choosing who she wants to spend her time with, and get to know. She can also shadow the staff and snoop around; or explore the ship itself, seeking to uncover the secrets of its murky past.<br />\nThe hospital\u2019s residents are an eclectic cast of characters \u2013 some charming, some eccentric, some rude \u2013 each with their own desires, goals and imaginations. They do as they wish, completely independent of the player character.<br />\nDuring the three days Casey spends on the ship, the characters around her live out their own stories - stories which she can investigate. Each character moves and acts of their own accord, on their own timeline - sharing news with each other, opinions; arguing; joking; gossiping - or having a chat with Casey when she comes by.<br />\nAs Casey explores the airship and its many intertwined stories, she will discover that the effect of her actions can reverberate far beyond her expectations.Key Features: Deep Story - Over a dozen characters, each with their own timeline and story.<br />\nLiving World - All stories play out in real-time, along-side each other, throughout the ship.<br />\nFollow Your Curiosity - Eavesdrop on, follow, and talk to your favourite character to discover their stories.<br />\nCasey\u2019s Notebook - Follow leads, investigate mysteries and strange happenings.<br />\nA Unique Experience - Choose your own path through the world as it moves around you.<br />\nJoin us on Discord! https://discord.gg/KDAMU3N</p>", "metacritic": 79, "released": "2022-09-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-19T23:22:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/c4e/c4ea4490df1eba99aae17994b8d4c24c.jpg", "website": "http://waywardstrand.com", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 6, "owned": 18, "toplay": 17, "playing": 1}, "playtime": 5, "achievements_count": 27, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 156, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PlayStation 5", "Xbox Series S/X", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Xbox One"], "developers": ["ghost pattern"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Ghost Pattern"], "esrb_rating": null}
