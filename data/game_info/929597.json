For each enemy you kill you gain cash which can be used to open chests giving you wonderful stacking abilities. So at last once you have gained enough strength with all these abilities you can approach the boss once more!\r\nSadly there is no WebGL version since I could not get it working in time to submit to the jam.\r\nHope\u00a0you\u00a0enjoy\u00a0the\u00a0game!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-20T11:23:03", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/efe/efebb03bd1f87c64447ceeb326c7fc9f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 51, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["FeeFieFoFishy"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
