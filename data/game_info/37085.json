As the Luftwaffe launches its aerial offensive, the outnumbered Royal Air Force is scrambling to bring into combat new planes that will ensure victory over a stronger foe. Will they succeed? It\u2019s up to you, and your Hurricane or Spitfire. If you hold off the enemy long enough, you\u2019ll be the first to fly the Hawker Tornado and Westland Whirlwind into combat, and enable the Empire to strike back before Reichsmarschall Goering finishes his breakfast. You\u2019ll be rewarded with bonus missions, promotions, decorations, and a view of burning Berlin from the tail turret of a Halifax bomber. Join in the new Battle of Britain. Your aircraft is ready and waiting...<br />\nEnjoy the realism of a detailed damage model, stunning graphics, and outstanding special effects<br />\nChoose between arcade and flight simulator control modes, and the RAF or the Luftwaffe in multiplayer mode<br />\nGet on board of one of realistically modeled planes, e.g. Spitfire and Hurricane and dive into the world of ultra realistic air fights</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-05-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-11-06T00:19:24", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c71/c71910816763f30b6fa9df5bfbc9ab65.jpg", "website": "http://www.city-interactive.com/index.php?page=combat%20wings", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 14, "toplay": 2}, "playtime": 11, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 399, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["City Interactive"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Arcade"], "publishers": ["City Interactive", "digital tainment pool"], "esrb_rating": null}
