It has support for Joystick and keyboard input as well as all the functionality that python and pygame provide.</p>\n<p><strong>MINEx</strong> is an 'in development' personal toy project. It is not my main work but in this stage I think it could be useful at some extent. <br/></p>\n<p>For running the example, unzip the file and execute \"run.py\".  In order to use these files you need to install python and pygame in your computer (Windows, Linux and Mac supported). There is no documentation available for this project, but if you are interested you can leave comment. I will answer as soon as possible.  <br/></p>\n<p>If you use some of the code or art included in the file, please refers this page.
