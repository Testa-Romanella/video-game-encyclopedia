She goes to look for help, but encounters an odd, old lady who offers to help if Ellen finds her lost earrings. She agrees, but has to enter a strange castle to search for those lost earrings. Inside, there are puzzles and a lot of platforming that put Ellen to the test.</p>\n\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Use A &amp; D to move, and the Spacebar to jump. Use E to interact with elements, advance dialogue\u00a0and Q to take or place cogwheels.
