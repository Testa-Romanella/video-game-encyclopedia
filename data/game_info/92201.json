Taking player feedback into consideration, the game was both further expanded and refined for the 64KB final, including the addition of extra rooms, foes and features, an arcade-style training mode and a 2-4 player deathmatch arena!\r\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe version on sale here features the same enhancements as the physical cartridge that backers of the \r\n\t<em>C64 in Pixels</em> Kickstarter received, minus the supporter text and additional easter eggs.<br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kill your friends in deadly 2-4 player versus battles!</li>\n<li>Smash your way through the arcade-style training mode!</li>\n<li>Collect ancient masks to gain new powers!</li>\n<li>Slay dozens of enemy foot soldiers, deadly ninjas, fearsome daemons, rabid hounds and birds of prey!</li>\n<li>Full NTSC support, with identical game and music speed on both PAL and NTSC systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Tiger Claw Posters Available!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\t\tYou might have missed out on the cartridge perk via Kickstarter, but we still have a bunch of these amazing A2, 170gsm matte art prints available to buy (42.0 x 59.4cm, 16.53 x 23.39 inches), bundled together with an A3 version with game map on the reverse! Featuring an original illustration by \r\n\tJon Davies (<em>Super House of Dead Ninjas</em>), buy the poster pack and get the game download for free over at our online store!\r\n</p>\n\n<p>\r\n\t\tPlease note that the downloadable Commodore 64 version available here is primarily for use with emulators, but can also be run on a real C64 via hardware such as the \r\n\t1541 Ultimate II or Turbo Chameleon. For emulator users, we recommend VICE, as it works on a variety of operating systems and is very user friendly. In fact, we've even included a pre-configured 32-Bit Windows copy with the download together with some simple user instructions (we're nice like that).<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\r\n\tThe original 16KB competition version remains \r\n\tavailable for free, whereas the full, enhanced and extended 64KB version of <strong>TIGER CLAW</strong> can be purchased here for $2.99.\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-04-24", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/559/559f492529c96bfa9b5a5bafa44a518e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 90, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["RGCD.DEV"], "genres": ["Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
