It has about 60% controller support. Some of the menus particularly the later made ui and the very patchwork ending ui don't even try to work with a controller, but most of the game plays a little better on controller so do with that what you will. Characters kept breaking, so I eventually game up and for all the humanoids I broke down and used some default miximo characters (I hate this the models I made/sourced were much better).\u00a0</p>\n<p>********************************************************************************************</p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>Jammer</p>\n<p>Tim Seig</p>\n<p>timothybcotter@gmail.com</p>\n<p>Twitter: @StartledMerkat</p>\n<p>Special thanks to</p>\n<p>Paradox Interactive for The opertunity</p>\n<p>@Domantas for clipart assets</p>\n<p>Andrew Davis for 'subterrainian goblin'</p>\n<p>\u00a0Azeem Brand for 'Zoya Beautiful realistic Girl character'</p>\n<p>Ricardo Cuello 'Ambient horror sounds'</p>\n<p>Music by Humanfobia</p>\n<p>some Ambient sounds by Rest!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-11-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-12-03T12:15:50", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711c480390bf51be8a2451221b84de54.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 15, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["That Which Crawls"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
