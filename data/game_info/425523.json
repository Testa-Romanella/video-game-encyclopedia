Space Window Cleaner(tm) to the rescue!<br/><br/>You are a window cleaner astronaut, tasked with cleaning the huge\u00a0window on the side of the ship. Sadly you were given the worst jet pack in the whole ship, so you need to maneuver the difficult ship as well as you can.\u00a0If the dirt gets too thick, it will make a hole in the window. Too many holes and the window breaks.<br/></p>\n<p>This game was made at the Kattila online community jam, in 48 hours, at a leisurely pace on my own. It's just a tiny fun game.</p>\n<p>Known bugs:<br/></p>\n<p>- The dirt will sometimes spawn in the metal parts of the ship and you can't see them. Whoops :)<br/>- No way to close the app. Alt+f4 to fix :)<br/>- Controls says R to turn right, it's actually E.
