I did an intuitive-puzzle game in which you have to fit red synapses with a white pattern. If you can understand how mecanics work, I guess that you could receive a good rating. There is seven little puzzles - and more you do movements, worse rating will be. Use arrows to rotate synapses. Start game pressing spacebar. I wish you the best. Thank you for playing ++</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-05-28T08:02:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/8cd/8cdeb8be5c9330a352e665b961a14d94.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 34, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Geckoo1337"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
