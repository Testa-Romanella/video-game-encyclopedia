Both versions use the same rule set; however, the digital version adds in tile pieces with which to place on the board (the analog game simply uses the dice themselves). The game takes place between four battling robots, who roll to power up their ability to move and/or attack each turn. The arena is made up of a 12x12 grid, wherein the players may randomly place damageable wall dice -- providing different layouts and tactics. The full game rules (PDF) and digital game (Windows .exe) have been freely released. The game requires further playtesting and is still considered a work-in-progress.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2014-02-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-23T11:27:41", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f5e/f5e3e2f65f234aa6df94dbefffb8dfd3.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 31, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Pete Vellucci Jr"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
