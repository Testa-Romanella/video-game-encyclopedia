You are instructed to BUILD a TOWER OF MEAT, because\u00a0<em>REDACTED</em>\u00a0When you build said meat tower to the UPPER LINE, you are blssed by the gods and allowed to build another one, which will be \u201cmuch harder\u201d, untill the gods are pleased! If durring the building of said glorious tower, you MISS said meat stack and it goes UNDER the LOWER LINE, you must replace the meat with YOUR LIFE. Or other body parts until you pass out, but both please the gods equally. Also dont waste the MEAT, as there is only so much to go around and the gods are hungry. Very hungry, probably a party or something.</p>\n<p>Tutorial Stack the given meats (top right corner) and try to reach the upper red line. Top left is your meat left counter and once you are out of meat, game over.\u00a0<em>insert Bill Paxton joke</em>\u00a0Also on the left, is your \u0336l\u0336i\u0336f\u0336e\u0336 \u0336b\u0336a\u0336r limb bar, where every time you drop a meat and it dosent stack ontop of the current highest meat, you will lose a body part. If the tower collapses, you will not lose a life.</p>\n<p>CREDITS MUSIC:</p>\n<ul><li>Kevin Macleod,\u00a0https://incompetech.com/\u00a0SOUND EFFECTS:</li><li>https://freesound.org/\u00a0ART:</li><li>Nik Maierle,\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/legi</li><li>Nace Jelov\u010dan,\u00a0https://www.artstation.com/njel</li><li>www.3Dsky.org PROGRAMMING -</li><li>Rok Kos,\u00a0https://rokkos.github.io/</li><li>Luka Jelov\u010dan</li></ul>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-04-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-04-29T05:09:30", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/22c/22cd608201c07b7bd870f9d20dead0ef.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["RokKos"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
