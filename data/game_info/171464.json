This is our first ever game, which is why it's free or you can donate to help us improve. This game is, however, a joke based around the Ugandan Knuckles meme originated in VRChat. So if you do find bugs, it is because we did not really take this seriously as it was very funny to develop. But, our future games will be MUCH more professional and less buggy. Thanks for reading and thanks for your interest. We hope that you play this and future games and support us.\u00a0</p><p>Note that this game is quite graphic demanding, so we recommend a PC with a good GPU so you can get the full (and dank) experience. Also, if you can't run it on ultra, just try other graphics settings.</p>\n<p>~ DM Studios</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-01-21", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7e8/7e833e3ca06f0d4a28bcae2fe26b66c2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["DM Studios"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
