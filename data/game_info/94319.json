Explore and spook your way through this small game to help the tiny ghost level up and move on. Although it was just something I threw together in two weeks for practice I had a lot of fun creating it and I hope you have just as much fun playing it. Happy haunting!</p><p>                         - Laurinda</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/df8/df8e90246e5025e3e4e5a9fca2a4b2a6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 36, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS"], "developers": ["Tape & Cardboard Productions"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
