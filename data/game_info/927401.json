You, a lone farmer, must deal with your declining dental health, predatory neighbors and big box companies trying to buy your farm, and idiot workers who don't follow safety procedures.<br/></p>\n<p>It is a slow march towards the inevitable.</p>\n\n\n<p>This game was made for the Global Game Jam in 2023, following the theme of 'Roots'. The version here on itch.io includes some additional content and small changes from the original GGJ version, which can be found and played here: https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/ground-down-6<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a text-only interactive novel with music. It contains several choices the player can make, and one optional choice where the player can input text. There is one ending.</p>\n<p>Playtime varies based on both your reading speed and the choices you make, and may take anywhere from ten to thirty minutes, though I welcome people to let me know how long they spent going through the game. <br/></p>\n<p><em>Ground Down</em> is free to play, but if you like, you can feel free to use the \"Support This Game\" button to make a monetary donation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Full content warnings:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>death</li><li>body horror imagery related to teeth</li><li>plant horror</li><li>loss of at least one finger</li><li>violence and gore (written)</li><li>animal death</li><li>implied sexism</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n<p>Story and Coding: Sam Inverts\r\n</p>\n<p>Special Thanks: Jonathan Moriarty, Yokaiy, Ted Anderson, Ven\r\n</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0<br/>\"Decline\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br/>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br/>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\r\n</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-17T13:53:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e55/e554cb4a07cb25a4d8dbd4f75a681d6d.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 2, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["inverts"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
