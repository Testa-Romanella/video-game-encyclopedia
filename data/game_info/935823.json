The mushrooms does pay a\u00a0 price so you can carry nothing else after carrying a single mushroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The branches from the trees\u00a0 can be used to craft four tools: platform I; platform II; door; heat.<br/></p>\n<p>To open crafting exchange UI you must right click the blinking button above Enoki's head,\u00a0 she floats back and forth on the platform above/below?</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-02-27", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-03T17:51:15", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b86/b86232348224be0a1ebcc3131876b096.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 52, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web", "PC"], "developers": ["Tenju"], "genres": ["Action", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
