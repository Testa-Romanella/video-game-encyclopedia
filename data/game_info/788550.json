{"id": 788550, "slug": "catjump-stankcat", "name": "catJump (stankCat)", "name_original": "catJump (stankCat)", "description": "<p>catJump is a small but challenging 3D platformer with a simple goal: collect cat food! Explore a house and its garden from a cat\u2019s perspective as you search for five golden tins of cat food. If you collect them all for your hungry sister Kitty, she will tell you how to find your brother Fluffy.</p>\n<p>catJump is my first 3D game, made in Godot as an assignment for college. It was a learning experience first and foremost, as such the released version has some unfinished aspects and minor bugs. There are some placeholder objects, there are minor cosmetic issues in the Mac version, and using a keyboard for movement while a controller is connected to your computer can bug your movement. (Disconnecting the controller fixes this issue) However the game runs fully! I don\u2019t intend on doing any more work on this game as I\u2019m going to get started on the next one.   </p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy my game. If you like it let me know, encouragement is always welcome.
