I wanted to make a game that uses an idle game framework- repetitive mechanics and upgrades, but compresses this into a tight, skill based formula.</p>\n<p>Wuacamole is modelled after games like cookie clicker, but deliberately avoids the more malign 'time on device' aspects of these games, often shared with gambling games.</p>\n<p>I hope you get what I'm going for and have fun!</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Design and Concept by Tim Sheinman and Stephen Thomas.</p>\n<p>Code by Tim Sheinman</p>\n<p>Art by Daniel Duke and Tim Sheinman</p>\n<p>Music licensed from audionetwork for personal, non commercial use.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-03", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-07T06:17:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/3f1/3f1ee2eba7a7365576396f211415a7e2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Owl_Skip"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
