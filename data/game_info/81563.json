You can select draw 1 or draw 3 cards, and it supports up to 3 undo moves.<br/><br/>Game Goal<br/><br/>The goal of Klondike Solitaire is to remove all the cards from the table and place them in sequential order to the foundations.<br/><br/>Game Rules<br/><br/>The game starts with dealing a shuffled 52-card deck, (no jokers).  The cards are then all dealt into six piles, from left to right, each one increasing in the number of cards per pile.  (The first pile has a single face up card, the second pile has one face down, one face up, etc.)  The remaining cards are left in the draw pile.  These cards can be drawn one at a time (or three depending on your settings), and used within the game.  The cards are then moved to the foundation piles one by one, starting with Ace to King.  The foundation piles must match the suit of the card.   Foundation piles start with an Ace, and are finished when a King is placed on the foundation.  Cards can be removed from the foundation piles to be used in play.<br/><br/>Cards can be stacked on each other sequentially, however they must alternate suit color.  A Heart or Diamond (RED), must be topped with a Spade or Club (BLACK), and then continued with a red suit alternating. <br/>Winning Condition<br/><br/>When all the foundation piles are complete from Ace to King, the game is over.<br/>Scoring<br/><br/>The Player is awarded Points per card in the discard pile.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2015-01-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-07-30T07:49:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c07/c07e1f126d83632764791796528331c8.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["iOS"], "developers": ["Six Foot Three Foot"], "genres": ["Strategy", "Card"], "publishers": ["Six Foot Three Foot"], "esrb_rating": null}
