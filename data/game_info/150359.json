Therapeutic behaviour can overlap with inducement and reflection.&quot;Teacup&quot; is played for as little as a few seconds, up to several minutes. Both landscape and portrait orientations are accommodated. It is a feeling for you to return to, usable as either an artwork, a toy, or a tool.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2016-05-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-09-01T09:32:58", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f9f/f9f1895a04ab2986fb7087ef72f13d44.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 37, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Alexander Ocias"], "genres": ["Arcade"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
