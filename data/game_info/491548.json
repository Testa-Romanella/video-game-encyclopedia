Currently, two lessons are integrated into the game: Lesson 1 informs the user with basic counting in Chinese, lesson 2 handles basic Chinese vocabulary. After each lesson, there is a short quiz, which will check if the user was truly able to digest the material given. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is a 1-man developed game by a high school student.
