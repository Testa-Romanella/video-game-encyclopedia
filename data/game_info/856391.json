What the people don\u2019t know though, is that there are magical creatures in the city that control Autumn. Through a leaf ritual, these creatures make the beautiful colors of Autumn last longer.\r\n</p>\n<p>In 5 specific points in this city, scarecrows await to be controlled by a pumpkinhead in order to start the ritual. Invisible to people, they magically rake leaves and send \u2018em above. One pumpkinhead though, disregarded its magical invisibility and keeps children away from jumping at the leaf piles.\r\n</p>\r\nHOW TO PLAY\r\n<p>Mouse Left click\r\n</p>\n<ul><li>On the pumpkinhead menu at the right bottom corner, selects/deselects any of the pumpkinheads to put in one of the scarecrows\r\n</li><li>On the scarecrow, places the selected head in a scarecrow. If it already had a head, trades places with another scarecrow</li></ul>\n<p>Keyboard keys 1, 2 and 3 <br/></p>\n<ul><li>Selects/deselects a head from the pumpkinhead menu by order\r\n</li></ul><p>The 3 pumpkinheads that the player can trade positions are:\r\n</p>\n<ol><li>The collector: rakes leaves that fall around the place for the pile. Once he rakes a leaf, it appears above the pile.\r\n</li><li>The jeepers: keeps alert around a pile, in order to keep children away. Since it is sort of a scary scarecrow, the children interest gauge in the pile diminishes over time.\u00a0\r\n</li><li>The ritualist: makes the ritual of leaves flying to the sky. Takes a few seconds performing the ritual and cannot have its head taken to another position while the magic is taking place.\r\n</li>\n</ol>\r\nCREDITS\r\n<p>Nizbel\u00a0\u2013 Programmer, Game Designer<br/></p>\n<p>Nicky B\u00a0\u2013 Artist: Scarecrows<br/></p>\n<p>Moustronaut\u00a0\u2013 Composer</p>\n<p>Camila Cirino\u00a0\u2013 SFX searching<br/></p>\r\nASSETS USED\r\nFonts\r\n<p>Rancho - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rancho</p>\n<p>VT323 - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323</p>\n<p>Fall is Coming - https://www.dafont.com/pt/fall-is-coming.font<br/></p>\r\nSounds\r\n<p>Leave raking - https://freesound.org/people/15FPanskaNovakovaEliska/sounds/461859/</p>\n<p>Button click - Kenney</p>\n<p>Enchanted leaves - Sound Effect from Pixabay + https://freesound.org/people/SergeQuadrado/sounds/460658/</p>\n<p>Children jumping on pile of leaves - picked from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oGIZC3R1oY<br/></p><p>Children laughing\u00a0-\u00a0https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects </p>\r\nSprites\r\n<p>Pumpkins - Pumpo by https://searhere.itch.io</p>\n<p>Foliage, Streets - Kenney</p><p>Houses - https://opengameart.org/content/brick-building-0<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-26T05:28:42", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/ddf/ddf6a07f5ba7ad0828256545088272fc.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 8, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["nizbel"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
