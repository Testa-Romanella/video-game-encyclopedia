If you get caught, you\u2019ll gradually lose kokopoints and if you don\u2019t have enough to pay up with\u2026 you will be exiled/eliminated</p>\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings, it might help you find safe zones in which you can hide from the chieftain while he\u2019s inspecting his stockpile.</p>\n<p>But be careful, the jungle can be sometimes <strong>unpredictable</strong>\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 : Collecting phase</strong></p>\n<p>Move in order to pick coconuts</p>\n<p>You have to collect as many coconuts as possible to trigger combos and earn points. Golden coconuts offer more points than regular coconuts.</p>\n<p>Always be aware of your environment, it might help you know when and where to hide from the chieftain.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 : Hiding phase</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As the monkeys are stealing coconuts, the chieftain can decide randomly to inspect his coconut stockpile. The players need to hide in a barrel.. If a player fails to hide, the Chieftain will take some of your coconut points.</p>\n<p>However, the chieftain gets easily restless and will gradually take away more points as the game goes on. Once a player falls below 0 Kokopoints, he will be exploded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>Left joystick - move</p>\n<p>A - hide in a barrel</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Producers\u00a0<br/></strong>Baptiste Figeac,<br/>Ahmed Ben Amor<br/></p>\n<p><strong> Game designers\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Timoth\u00e9 Courtier,<br/>Antoine Person,<br/>Lucas Sanchez</p>\n<p><strong> Game programmers\u00a0<br/></strong>Ulysse Raillon,<br/>Gr\u00e9goire Pierillas,<br/>Matilde Rodrigues</p>\n<p><strong> Game artists\u00a0<br/></strong>Audrey Ferrandez,<br/>Etienne Niemiec</p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0Sound designer / Composer\u00a0<br/></strong>Khalil Djoudi\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><em>Context</em></p>\n<p>This game was developed in 5 days for the HARD JAM event which was organized by the Institut de l\u2019internet et du multim\u00e9dia in Paris.
