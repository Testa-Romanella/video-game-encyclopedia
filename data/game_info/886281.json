So you can experience the powerful smash as the outside hitter, the precise passing as the setter, the monster block as the middle blocker, and the fantastic save of the libero.<h3> Support for 12-player online battles </h3>As long as you and your friends own the game on Steam, it's easy to invite your friends to join the games you create through Steam. If you have enough friends, you can even get two teams to play.<h3> A variety of interesting skills </h3>In order to make the game more realistic and interesting, a variety of skills are designed in both standalone and online modes.
