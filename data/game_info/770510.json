Yellow in its digitized form makes a statement on the objectification of race especially for Asian American women and enacts social commentary on avant experiments with language and color. The poem also sheds light on the violence of the racialized internet through form and content.</p><p>***</p><p>Acknowledgments: \u00a0Fiona Cho, Leonardo Flores,\u00a0Anastasia Salter for their support on this digital poem.\u00a0</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-04-12", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-04-15T12:45:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9e7/9e7f87674fa09d449c56a9099bc08713.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mrhee"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
