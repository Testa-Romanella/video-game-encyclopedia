Now he is stuck in the body of a student, which our hero isn&#39;t happy about. Thrust into this situation, we will have to help a flighty young man make some important decisions that can completely change his future and the future of those around him. Everyone will have to learn a thing or two, make changes in their life and it will be up to you to set every character&#39;s fate right, help them overcome their struggles and reach the happy ending.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-04-10", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-04-13T15:18:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/c3b/c3b82b68c7dee7de4b429592cea709f4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 1, "owned": 49, "beaten": 1, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 13, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 430, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["GUT.GAMES"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["GUT.GAMES"], "esrb_rating": null}
