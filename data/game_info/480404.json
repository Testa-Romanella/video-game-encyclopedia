{"id": 480404, "slug": "wind-it", "name": "Wind It", "name_original": "Wind It", "description": "<p>*Made in 2 days for Brakeys Game Jam 2020.2*<br/></p>\n<p>The Theme is \"Rewind\". I took the winding(Rotating/twisting) aspect of it. In the game you have a toy bird that you have to fly.\u00a0It has a limited amount of power to it and flying drains the power BUT You can gain power by \"rewinding\" the winder.\u00a0This is an endless game. You gain points based on you Distance and Height then you can spend them to upgrade your bird to fly further and longer.\u00a0</p><p><em>Note: If upgrade's progress bar\u00a0is\u00a0</em>glitched please go to settings and reset the game. Thanks!<br/></p>\n<p>Controls : Drag and rotate the winder to gain power.\u00a0 You will gain 100% points on Height and 50% points on distance. Use those points to upgrade your birds to fly longer and further\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hint:\u00a0The quicker you rewind it the faster you gain power</p>\n<p>Dev's Note:<br/>\u00a0So the game jam was 7 days long. But I had to make it in 2 days. I couldn't figure out how to program the winding mechanic\u00a0due to my inexperience.\u00a0Then I got really frustrated and decided to quit but somehow gain my motivation to finish the project and I had only 2 days then. I'm very inexperienced so do excuse my mistakes.And this is my first game jam too.</p>\n<p> Thanks.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-08-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-08-14T05:17:39", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/992/992ae4be1ef05e1569173e76ae780181.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 32, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mohammad Al Rafi"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
