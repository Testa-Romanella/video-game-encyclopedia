It is a simple Real-Time Strategy game which I used to test out implementing voice controls in Unity. Originally designed for use with wit.ai (the only free cloud solution I could find), it now uses Unity's interface with Cortana. If there is enough interest I will look into interfacing with Siri and Google Assistant as well.</p><p><em>Delta Squad Attacking the Enemy</em></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-12-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-12-04T06:15:52", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d2c/d2c0974b6ca7be47c28082f07209630e.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 16, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Shadow Armada Studios"], "genres": ["Strategy"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
