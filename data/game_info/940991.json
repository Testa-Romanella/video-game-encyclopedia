In this game, the player must survive five nights while monitoring security cameras and defending themselves from three main animatronics - Flumpy, Mangled, and Red Guy. Flumpy and Mangled move around in the cameras and can appear at your door, while Red Guy appears in your hallway and must be flashed to go away.\r\n</p>\n<p>Aside from the animatronics, the game also features a couple of non-animatronic characters that can appear and distract the player. Mr. Hoffman, a math teacher, shows up and requires the player to hold down 1 for 7.5 seconds to get rid of him. Mr. C appears and asks the player what the \"C\" stands for in his name, and if the player answers \"crap,\" he will go away and provide them with +2 power. If the player fails to answer correctly, they will be jump scared.\r\n</p>\n<p>Finally, there is BB, also known as Blue Boy, who is an animatronic that appears randomly on the screen. If the player clicks on BB, a random number between 1-2 will appear on the screen. If the number is 1, the player will be jump scared, and if it's 2, they will be rewarded with 8 power, and BB will go away.\r\n</p><p>I used Tons of sounds from fnaf 1</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-13T13:27:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aa0/aa0b85cb487188e550922aa70ea84446.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 26, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["MrThiccLikesMilk"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
