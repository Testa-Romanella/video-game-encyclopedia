In the middle of a space cop patrol route.</p>\n<p>So gather up your trusty(?) minions, defeat all the space cops, and figure out how you're going to get back to Earth! ...and maybe deal with a few romantic headaches along the way.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>SPACE LICH is a small turn-based tactics game made over the course of two weeks. Gameplay is fairly typical of tactics games, where units move across a grid and attack enemies -- but your players are all undead. They can traverse deep space without (too many) problems, and Zicros can freely resurrect any fallen allies.<br/></p>\r\nControls\r\n<p>All play can be done with the mouse.</p>\n<ul><li>Left Click - select options, move units, use attacks, advance dialogue.</li><li>Right Click - cancel options, drag camera.
