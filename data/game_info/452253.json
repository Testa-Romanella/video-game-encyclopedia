Sorry if this game makes you rage :D</p>\n<p>This is my first game. At first it was really confusing but I got the hang of it eventually. I hope whoever plays this enjoys it. Also if a lot of people play this game then I will make more games in other genres such as FPS (First Person Shooters), 2d games, 3d games etc.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-06-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-06-08T04:36:13", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/959/959516676be072976cf55808b7836eb6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Mr.ToastyGamer"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
