Well, with our assortment of different Gun-Bats, you will shoot and slash your way to victory. The kicker is, every attack and shot from your Gunbat will not only send the enemy flying, but also yourself. Staying on the ground is dangerous, so try to stay in the air by using enemies, weapons and other junk flying around as boosters. Staying in the air has other benefits, but try to find them out by yourself.<br/><br/><h3>Give them a taste of their own medicine</h3><br/>Almost all attacks can be sent back with a hit from your bat. And when the screen becomes a bullet hell, it's the only thing you want to do.<br/><br/><h3>Volatile enemies</h3><br/>Almost everything can be used to attack enemies. Hitting an enemy into another one? Yeah. <br/>Hitting your own bat into the enemy? Of course. <br/>Shooting your grenade into a group of enemies with a well placed shot from the Action-Rifle? Absolutely.<h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li> 7 completely unique Gun-Bats<br/></li><li> Lots of different enemy types with scaling difficulty<br/></li><li> Acrobatic, high skill movement<br/></li><li> Velocity based damage, the faster you are, the higher your destructive power is<br/></li><li> Permanent Leaderboard for normal runs<br/></li><li> Daily and Weekly seeded runs with corresponding Leaderboards<br/></li><li> Full Controller and KB+M Support</li></ul><br/>Now get ready.
