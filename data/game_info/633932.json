This was written in just over a day on the weekend of 10th July 2021.\u00a0I've made a few changes to the difficulty curve to make for a more interesting game - the original could take a while to get going.</p>\r\nHow To Play\r\n<p>TAZ is an eating contest composed of three unbalanced meals.\u00a0Each meal consists of eight courses. After you eat 20 (down from 50)\u00a0items of one\u00a0course, the next course is served. As you progress through the\u00a0courses, the food moves faster and arrives more frequently. Unlike the original, the more items you miss the quicker\u00a0the speed increases. This is to encourage players to stray from the centre of the screen to chase any missed items.</p>\n<p>When you finish all eight courses of one meal, you immediately\u00a0start the next. In each of the three meals the same food is\u00a0served in the same sequence - you start with hamburgers and end\u00a0with sundaes. If you devour all three meals you are rewarded with\u00a0a surprise \"dessert.\" What could it be - a stomach pump?<br/></p>\n<p>You start the game with three lives. Each time you swallow\u00a0dynamite you lose a life. The game ends when you lose your last\u00a0life. You win bonus lives at: 10,000 points, 30,000, \u00a050,000,\u00a080,000, 110,000, 150,000, and every 40,000 points thereafter.</p>\n<p>The maximum number of lives that can be displayed on screen at\u00a0once is six; the maximum you can have is eight.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2021-07-11", "tba": false, "updated": "2021-07-12T04:53:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/13f/13ffbceaa89162a02439ee0285537855.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 30, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Arlasoft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
