{"id": 748207, "slug": "paper-box", "name": "Paper Box", "name_original": "Paper Box", "description": "<p>Paper Box is a first-person room escape game. Player is trapped in a mysterious multidimensional paper structure filled with objects and contraptions. Find objects, solve puzzles, and escape the Paper Box.<br/></p>\n<p>The game is a prototype / tech showcase. Goal of the project was to learn Unity (and with it a bit of Blender). Game is sort of feature-complete and can be completed, but it's not polished, level design principles aren't applied, and there's a lot of things that should change after testing the game with several playtesters.</p>\n<p>Note that progress isn't saved.<br/></p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Paper Box was presented as the final project for conclusion of 6th generation educational program \"INKUBATOR - PISMO\" for \"Unity/C# game developer\". It was made during a three month period.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Cwekii Dominik Cvetkovski, our mentor for this project during PISMO Unity educations.<br/></p>\n<p>----<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<p>WSAD - move<br/>Space - jump<br/>E / LMB - interact<br/>Tab / RMB - toggle inventory<br/>Escape - pause<br/></p>\n<p>----<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>Game Design - Karlo Ko\u0161\u010dal<br/>Project Lead - Karlo Ko\u0161\u010dal<br/>Programming - Karlo Ko\u0161\u010dal<br/>Modeling - Karlo Ko\u0161\u010dal</p>\n<p>Music - one song is by Kevin MacLeod.
