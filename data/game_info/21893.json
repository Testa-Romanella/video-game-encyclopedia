Admire them and give them witty nicknames and then put them in the brutal ever-changing dungeon to try and summon even more y\u014dkai! Spooky cute graphics and powders made from various body parts included.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- Traditional roguelike with touch controls in mind<br/>- Spooky cute pixel-art graphics<br/>- Huge variety of playable characters<br/>- Fancy \"\u014d\" letter that destroys our SEO (Yodanji and yokai, anyone?)<br/><br/>* Comparing with other KEMCO RPGs, Y\u014ddanji  has a much steeper learning curve and is more difficult in general. Don't be deterred, though! \"The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it\", or so they say. And if you are unfamiliar with roguelikes, getting good in Y\u014ddanji can open up a whole new world of games!", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-04-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-02T06:34:20", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/029/029d57973daada8d8d1256c4fed49db6.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"toplay": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 198, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android", "iOS"], "developers": ["KEMCO", "Kotobuki Solution Co"], "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG", "Simulation"], "publishers": ["Kotobuki Solution Co"], "esrb_rating": null}
