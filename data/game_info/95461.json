We've got a lot of awesome rewards, digital and physical, as well as options to get your name or ideas into the game. Make sure to let us know what you thought of the demo, and if you can, please help us spread the word about the demo!</p>\n<p>The Devil's Eight is a fast paced boss rush where you must fight your way through the circles of hell. The Eight Overseers sealed away your powers, leaving you with only a shield to defend yourself. With your offensive options gone, you must master your opponent's movements, expose their weaknesses, and use your divine shield to reflect their strongest attacks back upon them. Fight your way through the eight <br/>electronic soundscapes that fuel the overseers of the inferno. Each world is driven by their own unique soundtrack, inspiring a fresh boss experience in this abstract psychedelic hell.</p>\n<p>The Devil's Eight is currently in early stages of development. We've uploaded a demo build showcasing the first two bosses Limbo and Lust. We are still in pre-alpha, so expect rough edges like unfinished features, placeholder animations, and bugs. The final game will have additional attacks, improved animations, better sound effects, and more.</p>\n<p>The Devil\u2019s Eight utilizes movement, lag, and stun states from the Super Smash Bros. series. The player can dash, fast fall, short hop, wave dash, use specials, and more. The Devil's Eight takes these beloved mechanics and builds upon them.</p>\n<p>The player is bound to a circle around each boss, affording 2D movement mechanics in an otherwise 3D game. This means you gain simplicity and precision in movement controls while still enjoying the spectacle and awareness of three dimensions.</p>\n<p>Being bound to the circle also restricts one's ability to run for safety. There is no beginning nor end to the stage, meaning that no matter how you try, you will always be dangerously close to your foe. The player can fight conservatively if they want, but they cannot find reprieve from the onslaught of attacks on the ring. Therefore, the Devil's Eight is all about spacing and surviving until the next attack. Part of spacing is adapting to and traversing the circles of Hell.<br/></p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>The Devil's Eight is currently on Kickstarter, so if you like what you see, and want to support the game, go check out the page!
