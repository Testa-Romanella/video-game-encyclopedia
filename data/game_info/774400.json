But the one she is looking for is nowhere to be seen. Can you help Kagerou traverse through this fishy dream and make it to her destination?</p>\n<p>This game was made by 4 people as a submission for Touhou Fangame Jam 8 within a\u00a096\u00a0hour deadline. The theme was \"Dreams/Dreaming\", and I just have to pick the most bizarre idea of mine. Note that there are still some unpolished parts here and there in the game, and some missing features that we can't quite make the cut but can be expected in future updates. Also the description here is pending to change later.<br/></p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>the game only needs 2 buttons, but there are multiple bindings you can choose from.\u00a0</p>\r\nKey bindings<strong>Move</strong><strong>Shoot</strong><br/>SpaceRight Ctrl<br/>X keyM Key<br/>Left Arrow KeyRight Arrow Key<br/>Left ClickRight Click\r\n\r\nMechanics:\r\n<ul><li>This game is played with only 2 inputs, move and shoot. You will move Kagerou by switching her polarity to gravitate towards the either the ceiling or the ground. While doing so avoid contact with bullets, enemies and Buzzsaw or you will take a point of damage.</li><li>You have a limited amount of ammo which is reloaded when you touched either the ceiling or ground of the level or when you killed an enemy.</li><li>Killing enemies gives you POW and combo, combo increases your score gain while POW makes your shot stronger. Be careful that if you take damage, you lose all your combo and 1 POW.</li><li>Killing enemies without touching either the ceiling or ground can build up your chain. You can end a chain safely by staying on either the ceiling or ground for a while. you will earn rewards based on how many chain you ended. you will gain 1 HP per 10 chain and 1 POW for 15 chain. However taking damage makes you lose all chain without receiving any rewards.\u00a0</li><li>Survive the level and beat the boss, and maybe go for a high score. Have fun.</li></ul>\r\nCredits:\r\n<ul><li>Programming/ Game Design: Iced_Lemon</li><li>Sprite art: Pedestal</li><li>Cutscene art: Quariumarts</li><li>Soundtracks:\u00a0\u00a0Sidedishes, InSuccession\u00a0</li><li>Sound Effects: slasco_art</li><li>Playtesting: CYCzen, NeoZoid</li></ul>\r\nInspirations:\r\n<ul><li>Downwell</li><li>Astronautilus</li><li>Dodge Blast</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Currently Known Issues:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>some typos at the how to play section</li></ul>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Touhou Project original concept, characters, and other elements are the property of ZUN and Team Shanghai Alice.
