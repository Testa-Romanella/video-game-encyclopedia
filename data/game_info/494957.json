{"id": 494957, "slug": "way-back-home-tatumvt", "name": "Way Back Home (tatumvt)", "name_original": "Way Back Home (tatumvt)", "description": "<p>Way Back Home is a cute puzzle game that combines a principle of platformers and top-down games. The game follows an apple that has fallen too far from the tree and wants to return home. He must avoid the worms to get home safely. In the game you follow the apple from different angles. The left side shows the apple from a side view (platformer) and the right side shows the apple from above (top-down). When the left apple moves to the right (forward), the right apple also moves forward. But when the left apple moves up or down, the right apple doesn't move. Since the right apple has a top-down view, you cannot tell if the apple is jumping or crouching. And when the right apple moves left / right, the left apple doesn't move, because in a sideview game you can hardly ever tell whether a character moves to the back or foreground.</p>\n<p>Because of this, you have to play strategically so that the apple is not eaten by the worms and can go home safely.</p>\n<p>CONTROLS</p>\n<p>- Use the WASD keys to move the apple.<br/>- Use the spacebar to switch between screens.<br/>- Use the mouse to press the buttons in the menu.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-16", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-09-18T04:28:35", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/711/711a092356e5ece5f9eb5c4279ad1cc2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 3, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["tatumvt"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
