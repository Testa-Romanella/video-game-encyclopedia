{"id": 947378, "slug": "beeroom", "name": "BeeRoom", "name_original": "BeeRoom", "description": "<p>Experiment showing fov created by projecting the main camera view inside a sphere and viewing it with a second camera.</p>\n<p>Culling masks are used to prevent doubling of objects shown when viewing the warped display.</p>\n<p>Controls are very tedious however this project is only meant to show the camera effect so I am not concerned.</p>\n<p>Click or tap up/down/left/right in screen space to move forward backward and side to side respectively. Left click and tap\u00a0moves up. Right click (on pc/laptop only)\u00a0moves down. Alternating directional and lift motions allows you to hover. It is very easy to spin out and lose control. Also the camera has a tendency slam into the walls/ceiling/other objects and bounce hard which may be jarring.</p>\n<p>If you have cpu/gpu/browser/etc performance issues the bee won't be ale to move. If that happens just use a different computer or your phone/a tablet.<br/></p><p>Press 'T' to reset the scene at any time.</p>\n<p>Note: I tried using both the outer surface of a sphere and the inner surface and it was more or less the same visual effect.\u00a0The regular sphere seems to be a little cleaner without any of the\u00a0artefacts on flat surfaces but it was also more tedious to line up and adjust the various cameras and gameobjects than with the inverted sphere. Also it needs a tighter zoom to avoid losing screenspace in the corners (as opposed to inverted sphere which wraps the relevant camera) meaning less of the spherization is visible creating a subtler effect.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2023-03-25", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-03-27T10:13:19", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/71d/71dfc942a0171a4eaae8b84a80cbb962.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["mop_bucket"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
