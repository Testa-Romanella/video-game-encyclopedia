The game is set in a small, innocent-looking town, where you, the player, have just moved in with your new roommate. But something is not quite right. Your roommate is acting strange and can't leave the house, and soon, you find yourself caught in a terrifying game of survival.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you explore the town, you'll uncover its dark secrets and discover that the town is not what it seems. The clock is ticking, and you must find a way to defeat your evil roommate and escape before it's too late. With a gripping storyline, immersive gameplay, and stunning graphics, Feed Him will take you on a journey into the unknown that you'll never forget.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is my first indie-game project ever!
