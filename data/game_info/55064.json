The game was the biggest success for its publisher, Magnetic Images.</p>\n<p>The player was free to roam around the desert and town at will constrained only by the need to make sure they had enough food to eat and a safe place to sleep. Earning money could be accomplished in a variety of ways including panning for gold in a river, mining for gold in a cave, or capturing a wanted bandit. Food could be purchased or caught from a river if the player had previously acquired fishing gear.</p>\n<p>The game became well known for its breezy, free-flowing nature. The game was also notable for not having a single environment for the player to operate in; the location of mines and rivers, and the details of characters a player could meet were different each time the game was played.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "1989-01-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2023-02-08T10:49:33", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/7d3/7d37b47bb06111e53d942dbfecf4d6c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"yet": 2, "owned": 4, "beaten": 3, "toplay": 2, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 2, "suggestions_count": 234, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 2, "platforms": ["Atari ST", "Commodore / Amiga", "PC"], "developers": ["Magnetic Images"], "genres": ["Adventure"], "publishers": ["Magnetic Images"], "esrb_rating": null}
