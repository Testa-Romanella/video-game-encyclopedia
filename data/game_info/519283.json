The planets need music and your ship has the bass.</p>\n<p>This \"game\" is incomplete, but as this is my first game jam, I enjoyed it. To start the game press any key use the arrow keys to play what few notes there are and see how well you did. Use the escape key to get out of the program since it doesn't end. The effects are still requiring reworking, but I will come back and finish it in the timely manner it needs.<br/></p>\n<p>Even if you don't like the game I learned a lot and had fun, so I hope enjoy something about it.<br/></p>\n<p>Credits to:</p>\n<p>Audio: <br/></p>\n<p>CATHRAN MUSIC:\u00a0https://cathran-music.itch.io/arp-synth-music</p>\n<p>Art:</p>\n<p>VECTORPIXELSTAR: https://vectorpixelstar.itch.io/space<br/></p>\n<p>GamesPlusJames: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyBsvsU7uiurMiBZIYXvnyg<br/></p>\n<p>BizMasterStudios: https://bizmasterstudios.itch.io/spaceship-creation-kit<br/></p>\n<p>HelianthusGames: https://helianthus-games.itch.io/pixel-art-planets<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-11-15", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-11-16T05:12:23", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/79b/79b4a8762e4537d4b5d10527c8266284.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 17, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["MelloBot"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
