I would like to hear your feedback!<br/><br/>Hello, my fellow gamers! This is Pixelion, my first game, made with Godot Engine! With this game, I want to learn more about video games development, improve current skills and master new ones.<br/>In this game you try on the role of a knight, a noble hero. The kingdom has been attacked by the forces of Evil, who have taken many residents captive and captured the Crystals of Power, and now it is in great danger. Only in your power to return the artifacts, protect the innocent and put an end to the machinations of evil once and for all!<br/>This is the very first version of the game, but in the future new enemies, locations and mechanics will be added! If you download my game and try it, I will be very glad to know your impressions. This will help make it better!<br/></p>\n<p>Special thanks to these users Itch.io:</p>\n<p>blackdragon1727 - for the wonderful graphics in the style of pixel art, which inspired me to this game. Many of the sprites I drew specifically for this project are also inspired by his work.</p>\n<p>SVL - when I was looking for music to play, his music was like a heavenly alms. Very good compositions that will definitely be useful for novice game developers.</p>\n<p>Have a good day, fellas!;)</p>\n<p>UPD 0.1.1: download files fixes<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-10-29", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-10-31T08:56:49", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b8f/b8f15d4180eb31598b7769bc27e1a33b.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 20, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Linux", "PC"], "developers": ["MurlocProger"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Platformer"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
