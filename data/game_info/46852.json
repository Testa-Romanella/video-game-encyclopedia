Run through levels, collect coins, diamonds and other power ups. Jump on top of enemies to defeat them. Dive into the water to find hidden areas!<br/><br/>This is a complete remake of the PC version originally released in 1996 for MS-DOS. The game is nearly identical, but some small changes have been made. This version does not use separate buttons to walk slower or faster, some levels were modified a bit to make everything work well with the constant walking speed. Also, there have been some small changes to make the game a little easier and less frustrating. And now there is also background music!<br/><br/>[Left] and [Right]: walk<br/>[Up] / [Space]: jump<br/>[Down]: in some places Charlie can dive into the water", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-09-22", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-08-28T22:04:37", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1c5/1c599104cbdbd188e40759560355b903.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": {"owned": 4, "toplay": 1, "dropped": 1}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 1, "suggestions_count": 281, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 1, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Wiering Software"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Wiering Software"], "esrb_rating": null}
