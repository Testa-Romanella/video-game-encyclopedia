{"id": 855945, "slug": "heiz-master", "name": "Heiz Master", "name_original": "Heiz Master", "description": "<p> In Heizmaster the player is equipped with 1 item: a shovel. With this shovel he can pick up coal and \u201chit\u201d their machines, including the gears and pressure-meters which control direction and speed of the ship. Once the player has picked up some coal they can use this to either fuel the ovens, either by throwing it into the opening in a short range, or throwing the coal in the air and then hitting it into the openings in a baseball like fashion using the shovel as a bat. The coal can also be used to hit the machines over a longer distance to make it easier to set the ships speed and direction while not having to stand right next to the machines. The ship is equipped with a large map that shows the player their position in the ice fields at all times. There are a total of 6 coal spawns of which 4 can be filled at a time. Ultimately the players goal is simply to survive the perilous iceberg field.</p>\n<p>---\u00a0</p><p>All assets not mentioned in the in-game credits were produced by us during the Jam</p><p>---</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-19", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-23T17:39:11", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/103/10313bd16361832799a4b8b6a0f9bd5c.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 9, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["JamCraft"], "genres": ["Action"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
