Players will use traditional rules along with a splash of color, to solve each individual layer of the puzzle.   As a portion of each layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers blend together.   Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final image and solve the puzzle!<br/><br/><strong>Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>96 Depixtion Puzzles - meaning 288 total Nonogram Puzzles!<br/></li><li>Puzzle Sizes include 4x4, 8x8, 12x12, 16x16, 20x20, and 24x24<br/></li><li>Achievements and Steam Cards<br/></li><li>Multiple color sets per layer = Largest Color Palette in a Nonogram game to date!<br/></li><li>Rigorously tested to ensure truly solvable puzzles!

You may also know them as Picross puzzles or Griddlers.  But we have a secret twist to our puzzles!  Unlike traditional games which limit your puzzle to one grid, our puzzles consist of 3 layers.  As a portion of each layer is colored in, the final image will begin to form based on how all 3 layers blend together.   Ensure each layer is correct, and you'll reveal the final image and solve the puzzle!<br/></li><li><strong>Well this sounds awesome!
