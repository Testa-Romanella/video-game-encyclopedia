His ship broke down and now he\u2019s stranded in the middle of an asteroid belt. He needs three components to fix his ship: fuel, a new hyperdrive module, and an asteroid shield. The strange inhabitants of the asteroid belt may have the things he needs, but they come at a high price: his precious oxygen which is already ticking down. Can Bartleby fix his ship and travel home before his air supply runs out? His fate is in your hands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Left Mouse Button\u2026\u2026\u2026..Activate Thrusters</li><li>Right Mouse Button\u2026\u2026..Open Map/Inventory</li><li>Space\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Interact/Repair Ship</li></ul>\n<p>Bartleby\u2019s space suit is equipped with zero-gravity thrusters.
