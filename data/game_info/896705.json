The poor dev has tried over and over, but has been unsuccessful at completing any R18 projects lately. Syren, Aoi and Lola expose the slacker in this hard-hitting expose!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSyren and Friends Roast the Dev is a short comedic diversion not too dissimilar from a heavily railroaded kinetic novel that lacks momentum. Enjoy the cute and curvy cast as they talk about things only a geriatric millennial would understand.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot quite a game, not quite a visual novel. This software has a few rare and sporadic interactive elements that do not impact the overall narrative. Assuming there was a narrative, to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt does have a few neato hidden object puzzles to solve, a few painful unskippable videos, and some semi-lewd load screens if you are into that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAll characters are 18 years or older.", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-12-17", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-12-19T05:55:12", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d03/d03b32e16c66d0a9f49e43bca43e605f.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 11, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 444, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["LarsMidnatt"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Witching Hour Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": null}
