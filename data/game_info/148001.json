Theme \"The more you have, the worse it is\". Made a puzzle game where the objective is to get the gold block to land on to the green trigger in the least amount of turns possible, each phase (puzzle) introduces a new block mechanic and also increases the number of gold blocks in the puzzle.</p>\n<p>It is a very early prototype of the game of course. set it up as more of a demo to try out the games features and we will be considering continuing this further as a potential mobile game idea.</p>\n<p>Ludum Dare entry's made by @essejparr.</p>\n<p>Edit 1* There is a known bug with the gold blocks respawning after they have already fallen, since there is no trigger event related with the green buttons, if you land a gold block on the green just count that gold block as complete and disregard the respawn.<br/></p>\n<p>https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/puzzle-progress-prototype<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2017-12-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d9f/d9f0e8a118ed56b8b2c08d6ed07036c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 4, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["saucygames"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
