Use the arrow keys to run toward your space craft in the distance.<br/></p>\n<p>This is the very first complete\u00a0game that I made by myself. I created it in my first game design class. Box Shooter: New World turned out to be very different from the game my professor had originally asked us to create\u00a0(Box Shooter), so I wanted to show it off! Right now, it is only one level, but I may create more later.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I did not create myself is the audio. I downloaded the free Footstep (Snow and Grass) and Grenade Sound FX audio packages from the Unity Asset Store.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-01-28", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-01-31T14:36:18", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/e0e/e0e49dfe4e8da46aff0b971402cb80a7.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 41, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["macOS"], "developers": ["Kayleigh Manchester"], "genres": ["Shooter"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
