I nailed down the basic systems for the farming simulator side but failed to get round to the horror.</p>\n<p><strong>--Premise--</strong><br/>Spooky Farming would take place over two periods, day and night. During the day, it would play like a regular farming simulator with the player tasked to grow and cultivate plants on a farm. However at night, it would take a dark twist as the player is tormented by a monster. If the player was caught (and presumably killed) by the monster the game would end.</p>\n<p>The player would have to hide inside their crops (wheat / tall grass), avoiding the monster till sunrise. A fast forward stone in the center of the farm would allow the day/night sections to finish quicker, but would leave the player valuable to attack.</p>\n<p><strong>--What I learned--</strong><br/>The main aspect of development that held me back was time management. Unfortunately I was unable to spend as long as I would of liked on the game. Considering this I think I managed to achieve a lot in the small amount of time. Additionally I improved and wrote some code that I will be able to bring forward into future projects.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-04-23", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/765/76527784ce12e3e5dc2fe8b0c37ba177.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 5, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Robo_Chiz"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
