{"id": 373396, "slug": "4-block-dungeon-prototype", "name": "4-Block Dungeon (prototype)", "name_original": "4-Block Dungeon (prototype)", "description": "<p><strong>UPDATE: I updated both versions of the gamewith a couple of tweaks and performance improvements.</strong><br/><br/><strong><em>This is a very early prototype</em>\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In this game,\u00a0<strong><em>you</em></strong> create the dungeon and explore it at the same time! Control the falling pieces, move them, rotate them, connect them and make them fit together. As the knight, wander the maze-like structure looking for gold and\u00a0defeating enemies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jut like in the classic puzzle game Tetris, creating a full row of tiles will make them disappear. And that includes whatever was inside them! So be careful not to place your knight inside a line that is being cleared!</p>\n<p>The goal of this prototype version of the game is to collect as much loot and level up by defeating the enemies before the map gets filled to the top. When that happens, a portal will appear. Reaching it will mean\u00a0victory.</p>\r\nNote that currently leveling up and collecting gold doesn't have any practical purpose, it's just a way to keep track of how long you've been able to keep the game going\r\n<p>Getting stuck with no way out is not uncommon inside a dungeon. Luckily for you, the knight is very resourceful and can use different tools to help him during the exploration:</p>\n<ul><li>\u00a0Hammers can create a tile of walkable ground in front of you</li><li>Pickaxes let you break walls</li><li>Bombs let you destroy tiles (this can be helpful to fit rooms together)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Controls:</strong><br/>- WASD/Arrow keys to move your character<br/>- Q to switch the active item<br/>- (Hold down) Space while moving to use an item</p>\n<p>- J/L to move the falling room<br/>- I to rotate it<br/>- K to make it fall faster</p>\n<p>- Esc to pause</p>\n<p>I know <strong>multiplayer</strong> is highly requested and I agree that it's a great fit for this game. I didn't have the time to properly implement such a major feature for this early demo, but I think it\u00a0<em>is</em> possible to work around it: if you're willing to play with 2 people on the same keyboard, the player controlling the knight can use the left side (Q-WASD-Space) and the one controlling the pieces the right side (IJKL). I know it's not the ideal setup of course, but maybe this can give you a taste of what it could feel like. (If you want to play competitively, remember that the knight can destroy tiles with the bombs, potentially screwing a line that the other player was setting up ;-P).</p>\n<p>I've said it maybe too many times here, but this is a <strong>very early prototype</strong>. You could call it proof\u00a0 of concept, or tech demo. As such, it's is extremely barebones and many many things about the game are subject to change (if the project will move forward). Of course, all kinds of feedback are extremely welcome (and are kind of the point I'm even releasing this demo). So please don't hesitate to c<strong>omment, leave feedback, critiques, suggestions, ideas, etc.</strong> Oh, and bug reports! Can't forget about those.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-09-06", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-09-09T08:01:48", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/483/4836dfe8cfaf81aaacb1a57182c134ae.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "Web"], "developers": ["SquareDev"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
