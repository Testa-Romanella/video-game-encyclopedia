The aim of the game is to cause maximum damage over 100 holes and four unusual locations.<br />\nSmash up the toilets, make a big mess in the Kitchen, destroy priceless antiques in the Palace. This is golf played indoors where the more expensive the object the higher its game value. Humorous destruction and over the top trickshots are the way to score big.<br />\nDestroy enough things off the Tee and you\u2019ll earn a SmashBreaker. This turns your Ball into a Fireball that you can steer around the level causing more destruction and chaos. The bigger the mess, the bigger the Score.<br />\nLong shots, Ricochets and yet more Destruction are the name of the game when Putting. Hitting your ball straight into the hole is NOT what Dangerous Golf is about and whilst you can do that it won\u2019t earn you the big medals or help you beat your Friends to the top of the Leaderboards.<br />\nIf you buy and play our game \u2026 thank you .. and we hope you have fun. We are supported 100% by our players, no corporate or VC safety nets here.<br />\nSo if you experience any problems at all please tell us \u2013 so we can have a go at fixing whatever problem it is you\u2019re having. We are a team that loves to listen to our players and we strive to do better every day.
