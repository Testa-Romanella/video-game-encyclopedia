She \n      loves to hug the curves of every race track as close as she can, and is \n      always the first to have a drink after the racing is over Latisha is so \n      cool you have to check her for a pulse \u2013 nothing riles this girl!

But she isn\u2019t all brains though, Bianca \n      knows how to have fun &amp; relax with her mates once the race is finished. \n      Amber may come across like she\u2019s more concerned about her looks but \n      that\u2019s only because she wants to win in style!
