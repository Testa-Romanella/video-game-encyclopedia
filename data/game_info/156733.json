Each bubble's fitness is determined by how close it got to the goal last generation, with a boost if it reached the goal. Bubbles with higher fitness values are more likely to survive or  be chosen to mix genes with another bubble for the next generation. Mutations randomly occur at each step.</p>\n<p>Check out the open-source code on github! <br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2018-08-01", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-01-09T12:41:06", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fef/fefd51b95249d4aed15e80bf80c77ab2.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 23, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Web"], "developers": ["Pilot Wave Games"], "genres": ["Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
