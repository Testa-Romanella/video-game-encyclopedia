Left click and drag to select your orcs, right click to move. The Horde acts as both the player character and a resource to manage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The humorous tone and stylized visuals encourage the player to sacrifice the orcs.The player can use objects like oil barrels and bonfires placed in the level. Play with fire, burn obstacles or blow them away. Orcs that consume oil turn into volatile walking bombs. Sawblades, swinging axes and boulders are all obstacles to tackle. Traps react to how many orcs the player throws at them, slowing them or breaking them completely.</p>\n<p>How many orcs that make it all the way to the end is dependent on player choice, timing and creativity. But remember; The Horde is disorderly, and accidents are bound to happen.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2019-10-04", "tba": false, "updated": "2019-10-07T10:04:47", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d87/d8731d08aa7b17b457e13bdf841876a4.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 140, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC"], "developers": ["Jonas Petersson"], "genres": ["Puzzle"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
