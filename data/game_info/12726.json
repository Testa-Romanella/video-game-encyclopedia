His brother and sisters fly in a mysterious castle. The tiny bird set out to find his family.</p>\n<p>The players have to use a certain set of tools to get to all the chicken eggs in a certain amount of time. If the players misuse at least one tool, the level is rendered incompletable. Enemies are present in each level and the players have to avoid them.</p>\n<p>The enemies follow simple patterns of walking back and forth. They turn around upon encountering an in-game object. If any enemy touches the protagonist, the level has to be restarted.</p>\n<p>There are four worlds present in the game with fifteen levels in each. Tutorial levels are also available to the player. In order to unlock a new world, the player has to complete at least ten levels. The last five levels are much harder.</p>", "metacritic": 80, "released": "2008-06-02", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-01-24T12:25:57", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2bb/2bbcb4cbb748512b386eedc0d2f1cfc7.jpg", "website": "http://www.tokitori.com", "rating": 2.84, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 56, "owned": 1600, "beaten": 23, "toplay": 8, "dropped": 56, "playing": 2}, "playtime": 1, "achievements_count": 51, "ratings_count": 119, "suggestions_count": 315, "game_series_count": 1, "reviews_count": 119, "platforms": ["Nintendo 3DS", "Wii U", "Wii", "macOS", "Nintendo Switch", "PC", "Linux"], "developers": ["Two Tribes"], "genres": ["Casual", "Indie"], "publishers": ["Two Tribes Publishing"], "esrb_rating": null}
