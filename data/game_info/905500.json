So this was a Doozy of a Project. This was my first Project EVER I did all the programming for start to finish. Normally I'm an artist/Animator with the games but I decided to see what I've learned. Most if not all of the code was made by myself from just knowledge I've accrued over the past year over 2022 from many prototypes, and essentially teaching myself C#. I've dabbled in both programming and Unity in the past. But over the last year I decided that I wanted to pursue Game creation... as an Animator. Sadly my ability to keep Programmer friends is a bit lacking, and no one else on the team wanted to step up. So ever present of being a Jack of all trades at this point, I put on the gauntlet and said the line, \"Fine I'll do it myself.\"<br/><br/>And so when working on the main project, my friend Sitton hit me with this Challenge of a GameJam that was doing. I mean, I don't think he challenged me to do it, but in my brain it went \"Bet\" and the rest is history.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>I focused mostly on programming for this Jam. That's why the art is a bit light. Also I'm aware we had since December 15th to Today at 2:00Am to finish this. But I work a 9 to 5, and I'm an artist and animator first, programmer about... 7th? After this though I feel like it's a strong 3rd... despite the jank of this project.<br/></p>\n<p>Hope you like it, would love some feedback and ideas for potential enemy types. Might expand on this later... but right now, I'm tired. Hopefully nothing majorly gamebreaking is in the build. Let me know and I'll fix it post jam.<br/></p>\n\n<p>KNOWN BUGS!</p>\n<p>Sarah's Animations are not playing entirely right.
