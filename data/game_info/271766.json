Zombies will be alerted to your position and chase you\u00a0if you shine your torch at them but will lose interest if you turn your torch off or point it away from them\u00a0and can evade them for a short period.</p>\n<p>When you do manage to find the snowman, simply try and get close to it and look at it to win. The location of the snowman will vary each game.</p>\n<p>The theme of this game jam was \"Light\" and so the game was largely an experiment in how sparing use of light can create atmosphere and tension.</p>\n<p>The game is only a prototype, is thoroughly untested and likely full of bugs.
