On the left side of your screen, you will see various buttons that you can interact with your keyboard, each button representing one movement.<br/><br/>The movements control works in 2 steps:<br/>1. Select the movement you want to do in the left panel (Jump, walk, roll...) with the selection keys. (by default WASD, it can be changed in game)<br/>2. Trigger the movement by pressing a key.
