{"id": 10724, "slug": "crossout", "name": "Crossout", "name_original": "Crossout", "description": "<p>Crossout is a post-apocalyptic vehicular combat game, where players can create battle machines from scratch.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the universe of Hard Truck Apocalypse (aka Ex Machina), a game from the same Targem Games developer, and serves as its prequel. The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane. Some committed suicide, some died when nuclear bombs were set off. Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player&#39;s reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car. The game features advanced damage model, which means that any part of a vehicle can be shot off during a battle. For example a player can lose all wheels and get his car immobilized.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>The game offers a variety of options for customization. Every player can assemble his or her unique car from scratch from dozens of spare parts. The cabin and the frame are the only two obligatory parts, the rest is up to the player. He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over. The blueprints of crafted vehicles can be shared on the &#39;Exhibition&#39;, where players can like and download them, to create a similar car or improve the original design. Game also offers automatic vehicle craft system, which will build a battle machine from the parts in player&#39;s storage.</p>", "metacritic": 68, "released": "2017-05-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2024-04-21T00:50:01", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/7a6/7a6f90e85a2e264c3b440bb4787cf378.jpg", "website": "http://crossout.net/", "rating": 2.81, "rating_top": 3, "added_by_status": {"yet": 76, "owned": 2482, "beaten": 36, "toplay": 13, "dropped": 324, "playing": 16}, "playtime": 3, "achievements_count": 258, "ratings_count": 476, "suggestions_count": 447, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 478, "platforms": ["Xbox One", "PC", "PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["Targem Games"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation", "Racing", "Massively Multiplayer"], "publishers": ["Gaijin Entertainment"], "esrb_rating": "Teen"}
