You can use both thumbs like joysticks to fly in any direction. To roll, move one thumb up and the other down. To speed up, separate them. Finally, to change the camera, flip your phone 180 degrees.<br/><br/>The cosmic snow points to the crystals. Collect as many as you can before you run out of fuel, but beware of the other two AI ships racing after the same crystals. They'll be dropping tail blocks too, so watch out!<br/></p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2022-09-08", "tba": false, "updated": "2022-09-09T20:06:45", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6c1/6c150d50a7eee667dd7f71447bed78c5.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 101, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["Android"], "developers": ["gradies"], "genres": ["Action", "Simulation"], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
