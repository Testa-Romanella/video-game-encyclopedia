Goblins have many similarities to humans, but also a few key differences. So here\u2019s something you ought to know:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Goblins are not a sexually dimorphic species. They have no concept of gender or gender-based sexuality. This means that from a human perspective, all goblins are effectively non-binary and pansexual by default. If you find this confusing, think of how confused the goblins would be if they found out there are entire civilizations where core elements of a person\u2019s role in life are defined by some arbitrary feature of their reproductive anatomy!</p>\n<p>Goblin language, which has been translated here for your benefit, has only a single pronoun- \u201cthey\u201d.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One thing goblins do assign at birth is magical aptitude.\u00a0<br/></p>\n<p>All goblins, without exception, have a capacity for magic. The form this takes will depend on testing in their formative years, followed by sorting into one of many magical disciplines.\u00a0</p><p>Some disciplines are newer and rarer than others. On exceptionally rare, historically-noteworthy occasions, a very talented goblin will form an entirely new discipline based on some unique combination of abilities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You will not be playing as a very exceptional goblin.</p>\n<p>But who knows- perhaps your choices will make all the difference?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PROJECTED FEATURES</p>\n\n<p>This is a prototype\u00a0created for the 2020 Spooktober Game Jam.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The completed script of the\u00a0Inverted Spire tells a multi-faceted branching narrative with many paths and possible outcomes. Projected features include:</p>\n<p><strong>Choices Matter\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>And there are a lot of them! Every choice you make in the world of New Order affects the course of your journey and how other characters perceive you and each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Relationships are Complicated</strong></p>\n<p>There\u2019s more to interacting with your fellow goblins than a guaranteed path from friendship to romance. Form alliances. Break them. Make enemies that actively plot against you. Try to make peace among members of your party, or sow discord and watch the chaos unfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Minds are Interesting</strong></p>\n<p>As a mentalist, you know how to reach into someone else\u2019s mind. Seeing what\u2019s on the surface is easiest, but sometimes you can dig deeper for the information you want, or even alter feelings, thoughts and behaviours for the outcome you desire.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure is not the end</strong></p>\n<p>Mistakes are a part of life. There are often multiple ways to approach a challenge. Just because you fail to achieve your desired result doesn\u2019t mean the game is over. Some consequences are severe, and even final, but more often than not there\u2019s still a way to move forward in your journey.</p>", "metacritic": null, "released": "2020-09-30", "tba": false, "updated": "2020-10-02T03:56:31", "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/89e/89e02174f6e81e6db6ea7c87abc7d763.jpg", "website": "", "rating": 0.0, "rating_top": 0, "added_by_status": null, "playtime": 0, "achievements_count": 0, "ratings_count": 0, "suggestions_count": 165, "game_series_count": 0, "reviews_count": 0, "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "Linux"], "developers": ["yozhikisblue"], "genres": [], "publishers": [], "esrb_rating": null}
