What a wonderful splendor of colors and twin-wait what's that?!\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1fGameplay\ud83c\udf1f\r\n<p>A\u00a0astral virus is causing calamity in the skies above, luckily a cure is being made- you just have to hold out until then. You accomplish this with your\u00a0<em>Cosmic Manipulator</em>; a wand capable of moving the astral bodies. In order to keep the virus at bay, the best course of action, while waiting for a vaccine, is to keep the stars separate from each other. Do this by clicking and dragging them apart from each other.\u00a0</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf1fHow to win!\ud83c\udf1f\r\n<p>When stars are too close, your\u00a0<em>Star Power</em> is drained. Run out of\u00a0<em>Star Power</em>, and the galaxies will dim forever. Create constellations by double clicking\u00a0 stars that are a safe distance apart from each other. Double click in empty space to score them. Dragging them apart from on another will also keep your\u00a0<em>Star Power</em> intact.\u00a0 Keep your\u00a0<em>Star Power</em> up until the vaccine is made (60 seconds).\u00a0</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<strong>ONLY\u00a0</strong>way to get rid of the virus stars, is to plot out your constellations in such a way that the virus bounces off of them and into a nearby black hole- thus quarantining them!</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf1fHow to lose!\u00a0(If you're into that kind of thing)\ud83c\udf1f\r\n<p>You'll notice that the virus will multiply as time goes on and create more chaos by bumping into celestial bodies. When they touch a virus star, your\u00a0<em>Star\u00a0Power\u00a0</em>will be drained.\u00a0 Stars that are too close, will also drain your power. The more stars that are clumped up, the faster your star power will drain.\u00a0</p><p><strong>A\u00a0word of warning:</strong> Just like in real life, it's better to avoid high density populations. IRL, you could get sick. In game, you could actually explode the entire universe; you'll see...</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf1fControls\ud83c\udf1f\r\n<p>Left click and hold: Drags the stars</p>\n<p>Double click safe stars in succession: Creates constellations</p>\n<p>Right click: Cancels your current constellation</p>\r\n\ud83c\udf1fWhy?\ud83c\udf1f\r\n<p>This game was made in under two weeks for the\u00a0Jamming The Curve\u00a0gamejam host by Indiecade.
